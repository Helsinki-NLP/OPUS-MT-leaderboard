European inflation has slipped in food
The accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is due first of all to the rapid growth in the price of food.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, with an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - after 2.6 per cent of October - announced the Luxembourg-based Union Statistical Office.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent likely - the Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the United States, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut off the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "we have to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
The inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, hit the 12-year record, while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation was triggered in the euro area as a result of the galloping food and energy prices.
The end-of-wheat contributions increased by 88 per cent and the soybean contribution also reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching black gold almost 100 dollars a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 per cent today to 2.5 per cent, but by 2009 it will now fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will continue in the next 3 to 4 months about 3 per cent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during the year 2008.
Gallup anticipates a government crisis
After a long stalemate, in early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13% - for the Socialists.
The difference in the case of secure party electors - due to the greater firmness of opposition electors - would mean more than two-thirds (71 per cent) support compared to one-fifth support for socialists (20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the limit necessary to have any parliamentary scans: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the secure voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 per cent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad, while another 46 per cent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As for the next year, the majority of the population had a deteriorating situation and only one tenth expected improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the consulates, higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of the Government was rather ill-functioning than well.
13% of the consulates rely on or rely heavily on Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38% of the consulates.
54 per cent of the population do not trust the head of government at all, and 27 per cent do not trust the president of the Youth Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While, after the October riots last year, 35 per cent considered that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the question on participation responded that they would surely participate and another 20 per cent said that they are likely to participate.
In a comparative way, in "general elections to be held this Sunday" only 55 per cent of the population and 15 per cent believe their participation is likely to take place. Based on the current intentions of the electors, there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of school fees, 79 per cent of the medical service and 84 per cent of the hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of study rights, the payment for medical consultations and the payment of hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
They maintained the average price increase of 16 percent in the hypermarkets of the commercial gold triangle of Budaörs, with the difference that this year VAT has not been increased.
Napi Gazdaság's article
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the commercial gold triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the Napi daily, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth much higher than the thousand HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already been "fired" in December last year, this did not show a drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price far below the nine thousand HUF, today they cannot do it for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in the turkey breast steak, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even at the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the Napi Auchan basket was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased with 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent of the prices in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket with that of this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year's cheapest and last year's most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year prices were felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, that supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the movement of a product, he may lose an important profit in the margin that is in line with the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such ends as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, as the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 percent of the price of basic consumer goods grew.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some basic foods, recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 per cent.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of the egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, as in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst of cases just 10% increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, which can impose the drastic increase in prices even to multinationals.
The hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trade triangle, they are constantly talking about positive results.
According to our experiences, most of the consumers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking preserved food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, the three shops formed large queues ahead of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the revenues are below their plans and not only for food, but also for household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, first of all due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The health circumstances in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favour the control of infections - says the doctor-head of department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a contagion with MRSA has been diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A person injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly thereafter as a result of the MRSA infection and since then no major surgery has been performed for the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of 10 December this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multiresistant agents have been recorded in the Nosocomialis Surveillance National System - said Karolina Böröcz, a doctor-head of department of the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been safely recorded, of the rest there is no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of humans carry in their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
The infections produced by the SA (e.g., inflammation of the throat, amigdalitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is overused or misapplied to antibiotics, bacteria that usually react well to antibiotics are transformed into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and are quickly infected under inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound or septicemia infections, first of all to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened body, to the elderly or to people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistance
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff care for them in rubber gloves and mask and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients hospitalized are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so infection can not be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the sick who carry the MRSA in their body.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when the MRSA infections already occur visible in the patient - said the doctor-head of department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict arrangements for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological patterns.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is directed, that is, microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in the case of ambulant patients or in basic care - Karolina Böröcz said.
It's saved with the disinfectants.
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, the washing of hands, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also considerable deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by drop transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - it has added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with less favourable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are carried out, fewer such infections are recorded or the infection of the pathogen may be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expenditure for the National Health Insurance Fund, and is therefore fought against it in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The program appears to be successful, according to data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholemia by the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district.
It can be excluded the possibility that led drunk or in a stunned state that since then resigned commander of the police of the district XXII, who on Tuesday hit and caused the death of a passer-by - said on Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the General Prosecutor's Office of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic drink before putting himself behind the steering wheel.
The then head of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when he turned to Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district, hit a 55-year-old man, who was trying to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This last fact, that is, the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way to bend.)
The passer-by lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very touched by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Office of the Prosecutor of Investigation.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning worked with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian finance minister János Veres and the vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had already signed a credit contract of EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit contract is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective for Hungary, and the decision will be taken later on when the credit contract is extended.
The parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million for innovations, which the budget will use mainly for the innovation and research project at the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary completed the details of the Metro financing with the EU, it will again address the issue that if necessary or not to change the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this can take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary in the amount of €8.4 billion.
The interest of the appropriations is in accordance with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the credit at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country, which was recently mentioned.
What, where and those who buy on the even cheaper market in the EU, which will be quickly increased?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re / Max.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is without a doubt Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of the ski slopes and the beach chalet.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the Albena beaches, the "Costa Dorada," the "Costa del Sol," the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re / Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the particularly cheap area of Rus.
Similarly, Sofia capital can be attractive, business and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf havens in Europe, thus being able to be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, careful investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy buildings in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of living.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Also present are the Maltese and Cypriot promoters and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in the ski havens.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re / Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated buildings for a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to be renewed later.
They demand good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, the shops and generally a local doctor is important.
The second category is the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria was included in the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium to long term.
The price of capital buildings is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of real estate significantly exceeds the growth in wages.
Fodor and the six for hundreds of Hungarians
According to the Minister of the Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the expert level will be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue the negotiations at the ministerial level on the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world discuss the Bali Road Map, which it has on the post-emission reduction period, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
At present, lively discussions are taking place between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not wish to negotiate on precise figures at the moment, although it tends to agree that, compared to the 1990 situation, the emissions of greenhouse gases will be reduced by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020.
Another major theme of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are or are not willing to provide material and technological support to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on the aid to be provided to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be headed by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit."
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for the Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent to 2020, as compared with the 1990 level, regardless of whether the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed or not, and is prepared to commit itself to reducing even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capacities.
Gábor Fodor noted that the countries that signed the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to a decline of 5.2 per cent, within which the then 15 EU Member States committed themselves to an 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by 6 per cent over the period 1985-87, which our country will fulfil - the press release of the Ministry of the Environment points out.
Much is at stake in Balí, since in two years' time the international long-term climate policy agreement will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments, made in the Kyoto Protocol, would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN international scientific association dealing with climate change, which was won by the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and would not prevent an increase of more than 2o C in the Earth's average temperature, a fact that scientists believe would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video dealer publish recordings of recorded actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British air force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini-cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general operating body, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers who have been thus charged to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally loaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs almost nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots - the BBC has told the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - but inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'être of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the recelously edited and censored recordings, the distributor also has amateur videos, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak as much as possible of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, many videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different way to recruit with free-downloadable video games, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly instead of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty pastry at the Christmas party of the ministries
The Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to fire the year 2007 with salty pastry and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so the power is amused.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
The Orphans' Christmas will receive gifts from the children of the fallen soldiers, and for the Missionary's Christmas, the families of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad will be invited. A reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive environment at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The festival of the MET will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty is expected.
At the portfolio party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also play, and there will be a draw of tombola.
The ANF Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we are not able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas held the dance of the day of Lucia on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The party began with the minister's words of greeting and after dinner there was live dancing music.
In response to the [origo] question, they reported: to attend the dance it was not compulsory to wear a suit or dress at night.
The health, work and local government portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the other hand, work minister Monika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year working meeting.
There are a hundred and eighty guests who - as the press department reports - will have only coffee and salty pastry, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The local government minister, Gordon Bajnai, will instead simply offer with his colleagues in the Ministry's classroom for local governments and territorial development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - of this budget will be paid the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers all years celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the time of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agricultural portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on 20 January, at the Ministry no Christmas will be held.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as reported by the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception standing, to which only the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions that are held every year, begin with a brief speech of greeting from the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the relevant press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than 400 people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will be a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike on Monday for an indefinite period of time.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - unemployment will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail traffic will be completely stopped and the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike until 13 o'clock.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike that they will hold together with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
The LIGA and the National Union of Machinists strike commission will also be established to coordinate Monday's actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will be on strike for an indefinite time, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly disapproves the public health law, trade unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only a vote on the public health law may be taken in the very late hours of the night, or perhaps at midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: in the railways, work will be stopped for an indefinite period, in the morning part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban bus transport of the Volán companies may stop.
At the same time, at many points in the country, half of the road roads will be closed.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some trade unions announced their strike for an indefinite time, others for a definite time.
Until the afternoon of Thursday the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as Christmas parties approach, more and more people travel on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day to 13 hours, the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 a.m. will be on strike, the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educators' Trade Unions called for a 2-hour strike and the Educators' Democratic Union from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will be on a national strike on alternative hours and the Health and Social Workers' Democratic Union (SDTSSS), which are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new concept to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect a different proposal.
Political Capital [b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes may occur."
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of such an event - the representative of the research institute added.
They stated that this is due to one of the main shortcomings of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the differences between Gypsies and Hungarians."
This exacerbates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international average, "significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
We are reminded that since the fall of 2006, the reorganization of the radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been increasingly publicized and encouraged, and that since the summer of 2007, many organizations have been set up in the country that are self-defined as "national self-defence associations."
"The common feature of these groups is that they are self-defined as civil organizations, while they openly proclaim the training of their members for the defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, defence of public order), referring to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the state" - they add.
They said: all this is in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
To highlight the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations is not only a means of avoiding the legal problems of legal registration, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbouring States, they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by creating the Hungarian Guard,.
All this influences the political stability of the region "- they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in the Centre and East of Europe, so that political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar way as for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The establishment of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass riots of the Roma that took place in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to form the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defence."
In his view, in the last 17 years there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, the increased risk of ethnic clashes indicates that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the gypsies of Hungary also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defence - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
The research director of the Political Capital, Attila Juhász to the question of the news agency said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence risk change, they inform the public, as was the case in this case, publishing their risk warning.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the days of holidays - that the coming year will be less - reorganize the working days.
Even in the EU or in North America, parties are not unique.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holidays, state holidays and public holidays.
The holidays are mainly related to religious parties and historical ephemerides.
Let us also fest the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter above all so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have 11 parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national festival on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, a commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrated the foundation of the State, on May 1st, the feast of work, on November 1st and 2nd, we remembered our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country, the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas are two-day parties.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so it often becomes a bridge when before or after the party there is a single working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
He is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the party.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory, on the other hand, for companies and service institutions which, because of their role, work continuously even during public holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country is practically stopped, as according to the experiences, most people "make bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with mid-term or weekend, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
The agenda will first be changed around the work party so that workers can rest for four successive days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, will be a holiday.
The other change is related to the party of October 23: on Saturday October 18, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes at the end of the year party will be able to rest, since from December 24, it will not work anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to sour your colleagues' lives
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass us without realizing: all of them are part of our daily Folklore at work.
It is necessary to decide whether to adapt to small discomfort or consciously avoid the confused situations that may irritate others.
Tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you've been wanted from the marketing department, "says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the matter, maybe he calls the marketing department to tell them he forgot to give you the message (this is the least usual solution).
In most cases the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before you proceed to a shameful explanation, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitten your colleagues' lives and consciously strive to avoid them.
You borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to get a document, an office utility or your phone and you don't find them.
Remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but by this morning it disappeared?
Can you find your lost pen at the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll rightly be mad at you for taking their things away.
Do not take envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they are exhausted before time.
Are you talking about your colleagues' private life?
There's no good way to stop rumors they're already running.
Who, what are you doing and who with?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about your colleagues' particular lives!
Do not abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Burn in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even though others also know his things.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office and say you're sick and your head hurts unbearable, you feel bad or well, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your tasks imposergable, your work by term.
Don't mess with your buddy!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something will happen to you, so you must stay home, tell them, so that your colleagues or your boss don't have to face your absence the next day.
Tareos, risitas, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are you suddenly taken out of it the odds of your colleagues?
Have you unintentionally heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarareos, songs, conversations out loud (less when you do them over their head), patals, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent out loud.
All these can be annoying, even if they are not at this time deepening a project (writing, planning, organization).
You blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you've forgotten to send an important letter or a message!
Do not refer to the chaos eventually prevailing in the office, nor to the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the lack!
Ask how you can fix your lack!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Do not see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows!
Don't be upset, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation requires it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the public's expectations
The car advances slowly in the usual morning jam.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio, violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
National music life didn't hurt us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam seems totally different when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
It appears Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs from the national [b2] digital [b3] are gradually changing the image and even though the rock garage style is again in fashion, it breaks guitars, the national pop electro has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi whole until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked to sound [b4] film (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience was aware of the set that initially acted only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album released in 2002 from the 50 most important national records, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi, as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of being sold also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his whole are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they will gladly wear this label.
The set reacted as it should react: it prepared a new and even better disk.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instad, will be able to open new ways for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the years in the city of Pecs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
It is well the reference to the airful, the flight, but in addition to the airful of music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millennium György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the channel Mr2 Petõfi that recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of the radiators the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground ").
Well, it's all in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: the one you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of selected audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground [b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called alternative underground music can be boring, meaningless and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the generations of 15 and 20 years have the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from, and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
We do not make up music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you lose your interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow the Yonderboi example?
He works alone and made his career more to the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with his.
We rather work as a team, trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us began our career in their group and from there we took another way.
hvg.hu: In the list of hits of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in relation to this song.
Did you consciously open this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell with these successes our album.
This song is more than that.
We add it at the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How have you selected the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gourmet-style chorus.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of the soloists of good voice from our own national musical stage.
Thus was created that chorus of six women - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you computer the song exactly like that or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the record, we thought there was still something missing.
The chord attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas as well.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: In both the concert and the record, it looks like the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's brief solo), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and no more strongly than music, so music does not only accompany their songs.
On the stage, too, they are located at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
On the other hand, we consciously didn't want to distribute soloist papers.
The song is also about it, about us forgetting our ego for a while, who from where it came and where it goes, let us therefore let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do more work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually to none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock 'n' Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little, everything was put to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
An unfair embezzler.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kervel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and certainly with good skills.
The crisis in the American mortgage market was a long time ago, unlike all the large Czech banks.
"It has a fragile character" was heard from its superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what is apparent from Kervel's responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, are that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
In the summer, he managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity has already been seen coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kervel didn't believe it, and he bet right.
And then, at the end of the year, his profits exceeded EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify it," says Kervel and adds, "nothing has been left to himself at all.
During the entire interrogation, he stated that he had distorted the records in such a way that it was not discovered.
He even got to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange started to be interested in their business.
The risk became profit
Were you afraid it would come to be discovered?
More like, no.
"I thought I had won 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did he get so much willpower to risk that way?
In my position, we should work gradually.
He went to work at Société Générale in 2000, exactly after he finished studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was handled between the $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker for the stock exchange and in 2005 he became a broker for the stock exchange with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I was never gonna win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress, "Kervel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you.
"This is like a snowball," said the police.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or that they rather suspected it.
"While making money, they closed their eyes."
Only, after that, the coup came early this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in the middle of January he wanted to erase all prints.
When he got to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did you get a hold of him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file, "Kervel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to achieve 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes of which the Czech Republic can achieve 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner).
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programmes, approximately Kroner 125 billion will be released for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be spent on transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can achieve from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which next year will have the amount of KK 90.8 billion.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the newly entered countries that use them least.
Twenty-year penalty for the former President of Nicaragua, the court has decreed
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal issued a 20-year sentence on Thursday for the former President of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for the $100 billion (almost $1.8 billion) misdemeanor.
In spite of this, a time later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest in his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back in jail.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on the prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they bring him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how Alemán constantly transferred government money to a company account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how they approved the budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed to not accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, passed the new law with peace.
It's a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with every chapter and departure of the budget, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media, and this is why they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last Social Democrats' governments suffered from three defects that by this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as of the expenses of the leaders that are not only the pensions but also the social benefits that have been approved before the elections last year by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the public funding deficit, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not found in the State budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, fees and credits of the banks, often issued, senseless, obligations to which they disproportionately indebted to their municipalities.
In recent years they have managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this remedy.
If we only follow the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of what is boasted by ČSSD.
This was the ideal opportunity for your government to put order to the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to borrow.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some of them, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been unusefully swollen by gigantic measures.
And while they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditures approved this year before the elections, if in short it does not change the retirement age and pension reform then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, rule who rules will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By exagerating a little, we can say that the politicians who rule will become civil servants, mechanical parters of most of the money from the taxes for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the officials' expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the last government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We would not want the politicians who rule to become only officials, so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and taxes, the tranquility for the preparation of other law reforms.
Only this will make it possible to achieve a balanced State budget gradually.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
In the Monetary Marking, more than 100 billion dollars will be received by means of tenders.
In these tenders the banks auctioned the interest rates for which they were able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send to bid 40 billion dollars, and then another 24 billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, this is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," he wrote in his report to customers, Bernard Baumohl of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action by central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"The central banks must be really afraid of what awaits them even when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's main economist, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really wrong," he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems with access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate that is used for the loan of money on the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend themselves money even when the Central Banks of the US, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," said Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks will help to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the fall in the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are amazing
Global climate change is particularly affecting developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed himself on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of the environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
"There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "I often find only the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now be informed about their varied views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, capable of following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on global warming there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and cost-effective.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, it considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions of the present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600 thousand people failed to change their driver's license
To six hundred thousand drivers the date was passed and so they did not manage to change their old driver's license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials will give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without the valid card.
According to traffic, the card has not been changed mainly by those who no longer want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 customers a day.
In the queues you expect a half hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet been removed.
The issue of a new card lasts 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay 500 kroner.
Drivers who must change their cards and do not reach the end of the year, but will go out on the roads without the valid card will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand kroner.
The police can fix the offence with a warning.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall be Kroner 2,500.
According to the above information, a fine may be paid to a person who does not go anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices for a moderate entry of fines of not more than a thousand kroner.
According to the Vowel of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand kroner are not threatening anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the driver's license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of driver's license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalty to Berdych's accomplices detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Końařík accused of complicity with the offender David Berdych are going to spend between 13 and 10 years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as the final expiry the reduction of sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Prussian department against organized crime were initially to fall between 14 and 12 years of age.
Today's decision cannot be appealed, only by the High Court's revocation.
Berdych is also in this case, but he is first and foremost awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
In spite of this in other processes it has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the robbery of 19 persons and the higher court today overturned 16 of them.
Most of the accused & apos; s charges were rejected by the investigation for being fabricated cases.
According to the central Bohemia senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped the members of the criminal group to avoid the penalties.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opva and Końařík.
The charge relates to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as the theft is concerned, their victims suffered serious health impacts but are also charged with the abuse of power as public agents and without the permission of weapons.
In the house search, police found guns, steel core ammunition, a laser diver and a machine gun.
The criminal group, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of kroner from them.
With the exception of almost 20 men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and others guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have avoided the trial for now, are in prison in Ireland where they wait for a final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account to change a few children: 12 million
For changing children in the Maternity House the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million kroner of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, does not in principle agree with Veleba's proposal.
"We don't approve of such a demand, it's too high," said Dostál after today's meeting.
"So that we can get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterpart ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescisive value.
"We remain in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for all," said Dostál.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each of the parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloț's family wanted, for every month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million kroner.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only it was prepared at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress at different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by men although they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
The women take it worse with the trauma they are currently living and with regard to what happens today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Třebič Maternity House last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 kroner as compensation for the error committed at the Třebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured as liability for damage.
In case of errors they must be removed from the reserve fund and they can extraordinarily ask the administrator for help.
The court so far granted them a proportionally low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of one million kroner.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valacia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the brand Kingdom of Valacia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Valacia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka did not appear in the oral view today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polivka's popularity," said Polivka's lawyer after the trial.
To him, in the face of the words "Kingdom of Valacia," the image of the actor and comedian comes to everyone.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been behind us for about ten years.
Search for money and invention of activities, "he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work, "he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the brand Reino de Valacia was first used by Polivka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about guiding him towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Valacia.
From that comical origin it was a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš later created the society Kingdom of Valacia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed on the use of its name and signature on passports and even offered its owners discounts to the visitors of its farm and attendees to its shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polivka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valacia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team, which were fully dedicated to it.
The collaboration, between the now discomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on there began to be conflicts between Polivka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the one chosen forever."
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, led to the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as the mother queen.
In 2002, Polivka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society, which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which Harabiš is already preparing.
The new king should come out of him.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We are in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polivka can present himself, "added Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I've never really liked Peugeotu 206.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the gearbox quality, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is in the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, of the header space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi body means in this sense, that I will not suffer in the face of two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the inside quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here it would value more the invention of design although the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backs.
Also in contrast to model 206, the side direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the body have grown.
In the Combi the above-mentioned shortage of space in the header disappears.
Suits to the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is his trunk.
This must be assessed as very accessible (thanks to the deducible rear gate) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in the basic system it has a capacity of 428 litres which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison to the same type of vehicle best sold in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find out that the Peugeot is left behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child's car, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the flat that is quite flat after taking down the back of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car test was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 that would despise the family's five doors.
It is silent, it consumes little, and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the škoda then that it seemed as if the exhaust tube was covered by a rag, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all the pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 kroner, still can.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 kroner, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 kroner.
Only we'd still have airbag on the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wipers, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, it costs 531,900 kroner.
It's a lot, but you have the equipment's supplements in the Fabia and you'll get to a pretty similar number.
Now we have to decide only by which one of the two marks.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries are attending, and the locals are therefore afraid of further changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and children of the natives are increasing in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak migrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronzes among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In his defense, he said that the child was insulting his son with racist-tone insults.
The police also had to act after a two-girl under-age attack on a Slovak migrant.
The girls haunted him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we were going home, a boy came to us to the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to leave, he made us the admonition of throwing apples and pears, and then he got his pants off and showed us his ass "he described another nasty incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the migrants of Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools is beginning to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
Sand and golden beaches, big waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the all-round with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island can you find even more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the Spanish era, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Colón called it, the most beautiful place that human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of cargo for the treasures that the Spaniards removed from America and took to Europe.
And then the American time came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He had it built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high buildings emerged, the cars running through wide avenues, which were a symbol of worship in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had its yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the show world and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita leave you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you are mixed with the cocktails as you wish.
And those cars already of worship from the 1950s, to this day, are still working in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that have arrived long ago have rusty among these humid and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old neighborhood, is deteriorating considerably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments as there are in the surrounding area.
Other places are metamorphous in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money necessary, its development is guaranteed.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the single world and that is highly appreciated by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the narrow-track sugar factories in steam or electric machines.
His garage for tens of years was not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brother models there are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And for that, there is no need to talk about Havana or Varadero any more.
Perhaps, just remember that in the previously mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, must not stop visiting him.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on limestone lands.
Mogots, limestone pilons and rocks of high steep in the falls of the valley, and in their grotto are acclimated fertile lands thanks to which are formed rocky that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
By visiting some of the cigar cigar factories you can find your final product.
Maybe someone would find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was shot there.
Trinidad
City of old abolengo that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought it fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers later arrived, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Esquambray saw, is such a remote place that still in the 1950s of the last century there was no road that would unite it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth meeting interesting places in the nearby area such as the Ancon Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which encourages with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small city in the west end of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
That opinion is, for sure, already confirmed on the way.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place in Cuba has been registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its untouched nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, the Anvil.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Tropical Cabaret, the patron of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of the Copper, the Santeria, the African religion that the descendants of those slaves practiced, could be filled out of all this.
However, as you say, you'd better see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, say Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment are what is influencing the mission & apos; s march in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American Defense Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as planned, representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today, the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to enable the population alone to start economic and security development, "said the BBC's defense minister, Des Browne.
Ninety percent.
The activity of the Afghan rebels, according to the American army, is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew in comparison to the last year by 27 per cent, and in Helmand province up to 60 per cent.
The NATO countries in Afghanistan have about 40,000 soldiers of whom one quarter are in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
They exactly ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about concrete goals for the future and the way we will reach them," Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, also spoke in a similar sense today.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's little, "De Hoop told the Reuters agency at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries that have been in attendance in recent months, there is a controversy as to whether all the allies make the most of Afghanistan.
For liability, Germany, for example, was criticized.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country, "Gates said.
Sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week, called the German soldiers bobbing.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are engaged in playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
The State's debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech the State owes 84,000 kroner.
The total debt in September was CKR 842.7 billion.
This year the government planned to lend Kroner 159.2 billion.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the economic evolution of the state budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to CZK 842.7 billion.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, since June, it has decreased by RKK 13.4 billion.
Thus today, the Ministry of the Economy confirmed its state debt data in early October.
For each Czech, the debt is 84,000 kroner.
Over the past year, the State has been in debt with over Kroner 111 million.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could pass the border of the Kroner Billion until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 9 billion and the billion kroner "said for the iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
In a similar way, next finance economist Vladimír Pikora also sees it: "We could spend the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we still don't know.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But such a change I don't see, "he added.
Doubt is growing
The state's debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The state's debt is paid by means of treasure bonds, state obligations, direct credits or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The foreign debt for now has grown from Kroner 1.7 billion to Kroner 123.3 billion.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion kroner z since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of State debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent which is huge given the way the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is a 20% growth.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform, "said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the State's debt management and payment strategy for 2007, it is drawn that the government planned this year to lend KK 159.2 billion.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the state budget.
The amount is mainly made up of the budget deficit of the state, which this year will be 76 million kroner instead of the planned 91.3 billion kroner.
The rest is made up of maximum resources planned for the Czech consolidation agency with about Kroner 13.3 billion, the reserve of Kroner 10 billion for the payment of pensions, Kroner 43 billion for the financing of the state's obligations and Kroner 1.8 billion for the payments of the European Investment Bank's loans.
I was comparing today in front of a court to Khartoum to give a name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British was accused of having let students between the ages of 6 and 7 give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear when all representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
It was a pain of lashes.
This 54-year-old British school teacher on the basis of the Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with an attack on Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story dates back in fact to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6 / 7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouth, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed."
The bear he - he himself had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a professor at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting towards a religious faith, "I'm just sorry that he asked the children to vote for a name," it's just an "innocent mistake."
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class."
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules that concern the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
There has been no agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have completed a sixth and final session of discussions in Austria on Wednesday morning in Baden without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, at a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was "at stake," his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, called for Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"Let us not prevent violence for now but enter a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90 per cent Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was in charge of a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of administration of the UN in Kosovo, the West considers that independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," said the president of the Kosovo autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last-chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his pesars.
But he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade particularly claims to be afraid of a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be taken exclusively by the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the final word"
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations have lasted for two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status," adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made "in consultation" with the West.
Bush Arches Israeli-Palestinian Agreement · Global Voices
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference that he had met with Annapolis on Tuesday in Maryland, that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations in view of finding a final regulation of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides' obligations to the peace path they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would "attempt to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including the central issues."
This name covers the three main problems of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas insisted that the negotiations to come be "global and well-founded" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
On his way back to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the negotiations to come are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008."
At the end of 2008, Bush set the end of the implementation of his coexisting "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States."
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this regard on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plane, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saoud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as every time in such events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was on the road on Sunday, shortly after 17: 00, Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but on patrol, and I was running at 40-50 km / h, without a revolving lighthouse," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unapproved, or not authorized to move on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated "to all gas."
"The police car was lost on the left side, after a failure to give way to the right," the police said.
The alcohol control carried out on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the disfonted front, cracked windshield, bumper-out) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "acts of involuntary murder and denial of help" to the IGPN, caught with the Val-d'Oise Department of Public Security.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the procurator states that the IGPN investigation at this stadium ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses to the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this minimocyclone arrived relatively quickly to its left."
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the calzapiés on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims have been self-inflicted yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also remove "any serious fault" by referring to this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, on which we must be very careful," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these some moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that just gives the scene.
"We go down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to reanimate them, this witness says.
There was nothing to do. "
Then he saw "a completely deranged cop, who was limping.
Two others were trying to reanimate one of the young, the fourth was on the phone. "
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that the people present of the unexpected situation of the young, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
Always according to this witness, the relief came "about 20 minutes after the police march."
They also had heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let you assume that the police services did not bring assistance to the young.
These young people have been helped.
The fire department arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them, "the prosecutor said.
The tension rises in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who had testified against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency had been injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, injuring police.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
To Islamabad, the Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations were reportedly held in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement collected on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president "called on the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and the waste they took to oath in front of Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise no longer fulfills"
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to rule in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's decisions," the judge told the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "no longer values" after the establishment of the state of emergency, declared Monday to the assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be transferred.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country according to which President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of the armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy in three (36%) is not planned, it reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better "fertility domain," according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years is increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
At last, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair of the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to make the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "plunged" by the astronauts to make the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday then that the astronauts had released from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece to soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see framed).
This module is a type of landing platform for the modules-laboratories.
But we have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After having moved it, the crew began the reorganisation of the solar panels of the module that have a size of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged in about a metre by a cable that clogged.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who had at first a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to engage in the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to snail at the end of the 30-meter length of the telegraph arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to make the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalker of the Nasa.
High, strong, very skillful, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After having inspected precisely the damage, it sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker" that had stayed near the airlock and, from the interior, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a minibaton of hockey wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocution on the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "plunged" by the astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts returned from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The title EADS penalized in stock exchange
The EADS action is currently in sharp decline to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which is conditioning the opening flight of the aircraft.
The cost of reducing the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion euros for Airbus," the mother house of the European builder EADS announced.
Because of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new targets of the operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS failed of 86% in 2006, essentially because of charges linked to the delays of another programme, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group expected a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the ballot box: the Russians are going to make a massive choice for President Poutine's party, united Russia.
Confirming its aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends the voters a televised message about public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, content to hand over a new burden against the West accused of interference - his predilection theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and want honest, more transparent and more open elections, without incident," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
It denounces a campaign stunned by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there are "never had such dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, former world champion of Jaque Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits according to his lawyer are prohibited.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprised legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to be made known.
Elected in 2000 and again elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
Which part will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that the government and the president would choose?
Whatever it is, to the legislative elections as to the presidential elections, the outgoing power will succeed.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo, they don't feel like they own their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolaï Kosossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic uproar," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "willingly renounce the personal responsibility" of those who had briefly proved after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all the social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new imported freedoms of the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the Russians, they will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old teacher: "Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? "
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the destinies of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerian regime, are in free access.
The 47 million file documents, stored on 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say, individually and nominatively, at the request of an old victim or his right-holders.
The eleven States responsible for its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to search engines and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow search "particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominating documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or of the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war in a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide them with proof of their detention, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Search Centre at Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Today, international bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18 per cent of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said.
The European Union's Foreign Ministers had last April given their approval to the European Commission to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) to sign free trade agreements.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18 per cent of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the ninth trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will go a long way towards both economies," and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants change annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and "10 billion euros of services," said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential." The European Union and India are on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The bank of England on Thursday was concerned to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion to the base index of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"To ease the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks," he said in a statement.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market so on December 6 at 12h 15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
This is the first time it seems that the England BoE bank puts on the market you liquidate for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that "it is prepared to take other measures to keep the indices" of interbank loans up to date in line with its base index.
The interbank index per day was on Wednesday at 5.829%.
The index after three months was set at 6.6 per cent, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using that.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the pound's change in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the proposal for a socialist law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
It was part of a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, among which the 50% increase in employment bonus, the re-establishment of the TIPP (internal rate per oil products) floating, a check-transport or rent restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the examination of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session has been held at the end of the general discussion which led to sometimes alive exchanges between the majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill examined by the Asemblea next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones entrusted from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
In another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80 000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as "more inspiring event" that he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stagnating in low-grade policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones is after.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that has recently taken place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after being dismarked in the landscape of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded their respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours take place rather in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a country festival in the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer for this festival is "very big," as in the case of 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been launched to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the rock taste, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 colleagues, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract the Hollywood film plates to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions."
Is it hard to compete with the "Governor"?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, you're going there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best, "he says.
The race to festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of the cinema here.
The Oskars race is started.
All the festivals on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebequese films, give them courage and ensure that the filmmakers make interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on board to Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30 ° Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be year-end rally in stock exchange? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to fire the end of the year, investors already rub their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, the month of December in stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made on the basis of statistics alone, even more so because, in the current context, uncertainties lie on the markets, at least in the short term. "
Although they are not in favour of the coja stock market carrying it in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in view of the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values in both long and short sections."
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not without volatility "especially because the impact of the likely fall in the types of the Fed is not known, given the high level of the crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be rally.
"There is not the thing for many joys," the expert says.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the peak marked on November 8 when the index closed at the 15,945.7 points.
Even so, not all experts have such a negative vision.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension schemes that occur every year at this time.
However, the expert nuances that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Ofucha, an analyst of Invernis Banco, values that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound of the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the United States regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be in charge of taking the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it is up to great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Ofucha, from Inversis Banco, claims that the rises will come from the hands of the bank and the industrial sector.
The construction companies will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they do.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow their same path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be a major feature in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well even though there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on just two occasions December has been a bassist month.
The real end-of-year rally was held in 2003, in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the pinch of the technological bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profit (for the time being the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it can count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew much of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20: 30 in the afternoon, and to open on Saturdays from 10 hours to 20: 30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of their offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Popular experience will be crucial if other entities are to be involved in this initiative that is in line with the business schedule.
This is precisely the objective that is pursued by the People with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernise the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the hours is accompanied by a different conception of the branch's space and a new, more current, design with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, claims that this restructuring does not represent a large investment, although if more staff recruitment, since it is moved from about six employees per local to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that with success, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very large schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to do the competition to our customers, 'says Rivero.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the stock exchange value of its rival Antena 3
We did it. '
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction yesterday Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'it is what hurts me, it is not because we have grown more but because we have fallen less', he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That profit puts its loss at what we've been through for the year at 15.66%.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulated a fall of 40.5% since January, costs half of it, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies is 3,571 million for Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (five-day editor) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it in terms of audience. '
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television station this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and PublicSpain, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this data were to be made real, the television network would record this exercise an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing over the 965.4 million in the financial year 2006.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit to its shareholders.
Vasile claims that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, which we have already given value to with 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is showing a certain tiredness at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced his profit estimates for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and by 7% in 2009.
It is explained by the fact that it has cut the projected income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same firm has reduced the profit forecast of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both values based mainly on their high profitability per dividend and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'attractive multiples' and rise of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to underweigh in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congress's vote on the amendments to the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of bringing both of them into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and senators to negotiate and agree on the best rules in order to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activities of the institutions in order to make the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new legislation will provide financial advisory services to both specialized and natural or legal firms and create a new type of financial service firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the implementation of operations on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disseminate information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management on the market and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they carry out, in order to facilitate the monitoring by the CNMV.
In its move to the Congress's Economic Committee, several changes were made, including that the securitised debts are considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated by the debt of US high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that can be carried out by graduates in Economics and Business 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the royal decree which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for his own benefit, will not require the authorisation of the CNMV and will be able to provide its services for the marketing of products and for the collection of customers to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised CPI increases by five tenths in November, to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data that are comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the one used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
"The PCI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and Minister of the Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the rise of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure," but at the same time he announced that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of the Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He has also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of about 4%," the Minister of the Economy said about the figure advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock €42 billion in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (€16.8 billion) since it came into crisis in mid-September and had to rely on an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, it amassed record deposits over £25 billion, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months because of the distrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government offered and that it will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around one quarter of the revenue in British banks that are deposited over the next three years to achieve that remaining 18 billion to reach the target of 30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as his favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Bat municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) today in the first hour of the morning for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the council and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then the district of the municipality, and that according to sources of research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The officers continue to register the municipal units and the city council and no further arrests are ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the plot of urban corruption that was discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore prepared, was arrested leaving Morales's home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales's commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight persons in detention.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and to chair the Congress if they win the
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
He also pointed out that "yes it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who published on 15 November his decision not to run for the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to fight climate change at the university level.
The former minister has recognized that the President of the Government has continued to insist that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He also noted that, just as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency."
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to make the House "the house of respect and not of insult or cry." And to make it "more and more like the citizens."
"Sometimes it seems, unfortunately, that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak calmly and calmly is the Congress, the president of the government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current President, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and has not wanted to see himself already taking his place so as not to fall into what he has pointed out, his adversaries might see as "prepotence."
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change subjected both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritized other political and social battles to unmerciful persecution, it was obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet."
This approach requires you to explain why your government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in what sectors has occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
It also requires that the Spanish be given the utmost clarity about the measures to be taken to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been, and there will not be, those explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Climate change measures, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costable, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the petrol suggested by the PSOE has found Zapatero so dangerous to the electorate that he has hastened to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that man so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not want to be moved by bike or refreshed with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local Totana police were arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Bat town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a host businessman for possible urban crimes, have today reported sources of the investigation.
The edile was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistorio, in whose dependencies he is currently with numerous agents, who have also come to the City Council of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Land.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the case file, which instructs Totana Court No. 1.
The first six detainees have now been brought to justice.
According to the sources, the former Totana regior and now the PP's autonomous parliamentary, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, the owner of a property agency registered today in Totana, has been accused, as has the current girlfriend of the former regator, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigués Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing the one that would be the largest residential complex in the Bat municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa."
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square metres of land that were reclassified and its project would mean doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the Viguese parks of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way, in the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the symbol of Philosophy has leapt to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counsellor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat that teachers take a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague reports on the introduction into the Criminal Code of offences relating to Internet downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal disks of less than EUR 400 in the store, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros from the store, the theft is already an offence, but the penalty is still lower than the penalty imposed on the discharge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than that of the download (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous race has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than taking a DVD film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authors & apos; authorization is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's getting out of hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor has one of his rare research articles: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
So, the feelings that the monthly pay of the workers generates depends on what the partners earn.
The study has been carried out by tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life & Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation was produced when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers noted that if both were given the same pay when they were right, the activation was moderate, but if one was double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if this conclusion required such science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing the Balkan war criminals for eight years since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Their names are on that list of which the documentary by Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not released in Spain), which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the criminals fleeing and pressure the governments involved to narrow the fence.
What sure is it for me?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible losses, is an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of the vehicle, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment is made in an insurance contract, which provides for the company to receive the value of the agreed premium in exchange for the obligation to pay the compensation in case of claims.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, length of the card, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use of the vehicle, among others.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that the more likely to have an accident, the more share to pay.
This is why both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as the statistics show that they have a lower rate of casuality due to their prudence.
In addition, the companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have less accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the likelihood of having some kind of mischief.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various difficulties in hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as the low driving experience and the old age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well insured is full-risk insurance, there are other more cost-effective options.
The most cautious drivers can choose a full risk with franchise, so that they get full risk insurance coverage but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer would pay a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the loss that the customer provides will be preestablished according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, the maximum responsible in Spain of First Europe, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection from damage caused to third parties, but not from the damage caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered for theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age try to be careful and avoid the claims as far as possible, as this will impact on the bonus, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this base fee.
"Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year you can afford to increase the bonuses, "says Noguera.
After the 25-year-old stripe, drivers have it easier to hire insurance, as the sinister rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended thing is to hire a full risk with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when using an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the rookie' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable for him to negotiate a full-risk insurance, as long as his economic situation allows him to, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by the insurers as the public with the lowest rate of casuality, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at full risk with franchise (may be 300 euros), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of the vehicle's life.
"They carry out a more relaxed drive and have greater purchasing power to afford to assume a higher amount of franchise," says Luis Noguera.
For retirees, full-risk insurance with a franchise (EUR 150), or one to an extended third party, is recommended when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is an important thing, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible losses, but also because it represents an important expenditure, which is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic is looking for a point in Milan that is worth the octavos.
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they need to achieve their respective objectives in closing the 'Champions' legule, as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians add up to ten points and have already certified in the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives the Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D games will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as the Milan has to fight the World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in semi-finals in search of a square for the end of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be first and a better crossing in octaves would be ensured.
Gordon Strachan's whole could even be used a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be trusted because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitten the night to the Scots, who trust to get into octavos for the second time in the restructured Champions League and in a consecutive way, after the last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the one was defeated in that round.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the triumph, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into octavos and to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, despite being final and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with what UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, with about 20,000 spectators since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice '(Victoria Beckham),' Scary Spice '(Melanie Brown),' Baby Spice '(Emma Bunton),' Sporty Spice '(Melanie Chisholm) and' Ginger Spice '(Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "brilliant'.
About 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to witness the concert that included a video that recounts the history of the group that made anger at the end of the 1990s.
The reencounter and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the audience that was plaguing the GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had banned it from him days before.
In the pre-show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British stepman "has not seen our costumes, at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice 'whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" led to the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm happy to have made the decision, "Chisholm said about the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
For starters, according to TV CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
The five of them have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will be in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia's export of fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each round between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopolic owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge more to Ukraine, as it has committed itself to pay an extra 50 per cent in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might be that Ukraine pays 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "must test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal record records of employees from outside Europe, a vigilante said.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was found to be related to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea how many foreign staff it has.
However, his report noted other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign staff recruited outside the European economic area, following the attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep was hit at the doors of the airport's terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged car bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure that they comply with the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish health board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal record checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The Auditor General's report recommends, among other measures, that the boards should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside of Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights the areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff."
BMA Scottish President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, partly because the boards have problems in identifying employees who have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely implemented.
This includes passport checks, work permits and skills checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and guide for the pre-employment of foreigners in the NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, states: "It was of great interest that this work should be carried out following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division's late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was named best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal."
And Bond's protagonist Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - white and black - with the soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only £3,000.
But the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic caratula of U2's Joshua Tree album, won with two awards - to best director and best debutante director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony - as Julien Temple's film on The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the best documentary award.
The award for the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a head of the Russian Mafia in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promises del Este.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The cincuinteger, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
Winston said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor. "
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters and patron of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nithy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrest 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda simulators have set up a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, following a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert," who has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning to kill religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping the Saudis who travel to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda as militants to fight the allied forces and to support the Muslim Shia government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudis Suni.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-western government of the country - had as their objectives the homes of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months now," said the spokesman for the interior minister to state television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have once been an appropriate place for life, they declared scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a twin on Earth than previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a living planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Physics Department of Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is being clarified why the climate in Venus is so different from that of the Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as the Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police decomise "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare to be enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy for presidential candidates to answer a snowmonkey's questions.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record video questions and send them for dissemination to candidates.
None of the questions put on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 28, were more ridiculous than that of the snowmonkey who asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the YouTube Republican party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party for next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates for candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest one, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the emitters noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest words exchanges of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing the illegal to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the subject.
None of them have the floor to be nominated as a candidate, but they both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and generally speaking, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of China's toxic toys and other external concerns, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first of all in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-time Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus would be in favour, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, coinciding with the fundraising campaigns of liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements of Wednesday's debate.
The two of them have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour dolores
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink in; but it also emerges.
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor are they sucked by extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour Party, of more than Pound650,000 ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister evaded calling for an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has moved from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated the regulatory weakness and the poverty of judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the courts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably walking towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they find themselves unable to rule.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their unbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is over: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is on the defensive and not focused.
On one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that it is new.
Even if I wanted to renegade Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as the chancellor of the treasury.
And even though it is not directly involved in Blairish's setbacks - or "partner cash," the investigation of political party financing - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, not been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The anti-anonymity laws for major political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that he was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fund-raising chief who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these actions, although the bulk of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the job.
It has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but it is diluted in decision-making on a family matter, a commission of inquiry on the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the moralejas are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, because he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party financing.
This will require an arduous cooperative work of the Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the trade unions - bitter measures for a party such as Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and strong competition.
Sharks cards
The subprime mortgage crisis is infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural that some dorsal fins swim around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their sights on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis subprime consumes other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already in sight.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortised or are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in its American consumer financing business, partly due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it's too early for panic.
Late payment and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of people (2005) led to a sharp fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of late payment) would be growing again, or it may happen that the conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between the subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debt to credit cards now that credit institutions are terminating.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than the active values, so that falling prices do not necessarily change the lending capacity of borrowers.
They can even work to beat the emitters.
Incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage are decreasing if the property is less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt goes up on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset retraction.
"We're not going to wake up a day and evaluate all the loans again," says Gary Perlin, head of finance at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a contraction of credit pushes America into recession, industry is certainly facing a more severe future.
We have to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent on seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of the employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was sentenced to collusion in fraud.
The three former Greenwich Natwest executives, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a well-known cause in Britain for the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, his case marks the sluggish end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - he doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of fraud in Enron, which helped its spiral of collapse.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interests at zero, but the three British knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest at $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its subsidiary parts.
But the 20 million were left to British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers claimed 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the Enron collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business fail seem successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to lose, more than 60 million in market values and more than 2 million in pension schemes.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive head, Jeffrey Skilling were charged last year for their role in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of over 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream's representative.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for company presidents."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millonary Fair, a four-day consumption orgy held in an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new Russian wealthy to all kinds of products, from mahogany-made yachts to diamond-embedded car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche on the next stand to his. "
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and calderilla compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Seated with fuel by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was on the rise.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the '70s and the Japanese in the' 90s, the Russians are emerging as the world's greatest consumers and fatters."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, this week a conference on the luxury industry will be held with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires that make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank you.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccable and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in a late suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit he used as a carpet network veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cutters, Mövenpick ice cream, pool tables on request, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was sitting patriotically on a stand of the Dutch royal porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the" bling-bling. "
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of more trajectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the striking logos to the brands of limited editions, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, General Director of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton intertwined with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equipped high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grills for Rolls Royce Phantom at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with embedded rays of Swarovski crystals, so that it would resemble a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karaptian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, next to another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karaptian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There's more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone booths (British style) filled with $1 million fake bill batteries.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millonary Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on lots of money, or billing a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
"Slug" surgery could cause a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and saw an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a car from the police patrol showed up.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died due to an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
The authorities still do not determine what caused the death of Mrs. Arroyo, but wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help to resolve the mysterious death that is in pain to the upper ranks of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, working and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me. "
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the County Union Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house was close to 3 P.M..
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead at the place.
It has been over a week and the authorities have said little about your investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say whether Mrs Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a withered rose is located at the front of the house, and a Dalmata barks at the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanillina ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
"She would say," you have to keep an eye on this one or that one, "he said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing. "
It is expected that the federal reserve will cut the fees to raise the Stock Exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with cuts at interest rates, which were increased with the reassuring comments of the vice president of the US central bank
The stock exchanges were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, the reserve's president, declared that policy makers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure the markets in the midst of increasing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend continued, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments to the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped to calm Wall Street amid bad news for the US economy, such as sales of houses that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in the US sub-prime mortgages
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average for Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55 per cent, at the close of 13,289.40, while the broad index S & P 500 increased by 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at close to 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of the first-order companies in Britain.
The Dax index in Germany rose by 2.6%, and CAC40 in France was above 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of the market credit tension after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001, was highlighted.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, tensioned the credit and the rates of the three-month "Libor" loans between the British banks, meant the largest increase since September, of 6.59%, after a constant increase since November 12.
England takes with judgment the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none of them are less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is in loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill up with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part time.
The one who does not get the sixth bat place will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport as well.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another one never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than capacity.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult, for judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a cricket player, unless they give him the chance to sink or swim at the next chance?
The figures naturally have a great influence on the decisions, but so they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time taking a "wicket" and a batter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player one day.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who plays for sure in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" as the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the stadium of Asgiriya can be just a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a major player, and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today's session at the Asgiriyah Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and support Shah's greater experience over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test in early 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent record against the spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two shifts in May against West Indias in the test in Lords, his house as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, he seemed to have taken from his "batting" some of them in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has the joy of living in swords.
He is lit for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for England's car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked away, to tell him with excitement, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he's including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he batters with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the true art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring the refugees back to work - and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday, expulsing exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and which is now safe."
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shia militia of the religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease momentarily.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia and a teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned to his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime did not want the Iraqis working in his country.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an American allied force helped to get Al-Qaeda out of his stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after which he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that an anti-Qaeda militia had started in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops strengthened groups of "concerned citizens," armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said that they had returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, which Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunni have been expelled from the Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will cause sectarian tensions to rise again and that the struggle will begin.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarlanders lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlandese who are not French" - that was the ironic bike on themselves of the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Saarland education system, which in a study by the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took fifth place.
In this way, traditional higher schools have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15, 6 per cent.
However, the number of students from the Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a bacillerate.
"The Sarre takes advantage of the system of vocational education," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the German Institute of Economics (IW).
More than five young people do their high school at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 points per cent above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very wide.
The offer of double careers, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences fell by one third in recent years.
That was why the Sarre Ministry of Education forced higher schools to make more publicity for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After PISA's first study, we made some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr," the project has no cost at all. Meanwhile, this model also mimics the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of backward students in school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the sardines, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarlanders are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chávez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez let the schedule change in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Chávez is currently becoming a comedian in Spain.
As the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State has reported, according to the new law, the time will pass to less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would in its day impose an obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the break-up of relations with his neighbouring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would have no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Álvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could greatly expand its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said he criticized that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
In Spain, too, there is a lot of talk about Chávez.
A new tone of call causes feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This was said by the King of Spain who was upset by the continued interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong situation.
The experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real salary account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the stretch of food and energy prices," he informed the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research of the economic cycles.
The new costs of unemployment insurance can also be borne by employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3 per cent from year to year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German social-democratic party.
On Tuesday, it became public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, prices are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not adequate for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and whirlwinds at the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers were suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays are silent at a height of 54 kilometres from one cloud and behind another, tells Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Nature."
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms may have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus this is not the case: if one day there was life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution, "explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface there are temperatures of 500 ° C, oscillating so that temperatures can be reached under zero.
"Possibly, Venus is a" diabolical "twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so much like the Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus's research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature," according to the researchers' opinion, highlight not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbouring planets have more common characteristics with the Earth than we had assumed," ESA reports.
Despite the already known storm winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon recalls the wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometres it is almost as large.
This planet also called the dawn star or evening star orbit around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its period of rotation is slower: one day on Venus is 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not look much like the Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On both planets water had been agglomerated that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it was dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, in Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Democratic Union) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute validity to me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with a great balance in foreign policy, says the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of One China's politics.
China also knows, "Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Foreign Minister (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of Dalai Lama and was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel," it frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept European politicians to receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that she is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battle with police in the streets, shooting, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like the case of France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany is not transferred to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot the police with rifles: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister of Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to see that the social problems of our country do not take the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse," published in Hanover.
Not all young people are unfolding in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, the federal state and the municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
That is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference: all this is already bearing its first fruit."
It's still early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people starred in serious riots in the streets with the police to the north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as it is in France.
However, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
There must be more vocational training.
Kolat points out: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families," greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "provide young people with the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training more quickly."
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1000 police officers are taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Internal Affairs, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday about 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The disturbance began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young people was not the fault of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The action far from the Federal Chancellor's reality shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing more should be expected of it.
But what country does the Chancellor really live in?
After her desperate, indifferent, and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said that she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach made to her for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous sentence.
He said that that would be a provincial way and so he showed that he does not want to understand what is in the interest of critics.
In the Lower House, it was very clear to all that this reproach was appropriate.
There was no sense of interest, nor of any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Clarke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away from foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: he praised himself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but he says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself - for two years the head of the Party of the Democratic Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he's working on expressions to get a boost to people.
And thus it damages his public image by the pragmatic conception with which he solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal problems are of little value.
The poverty of children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about that subject using subordinate prayers.
It's impressive how many times you're wrong to talk when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
He began to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory," when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate of Republican pre-presidential candidates on YouTube and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates have already been noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani for making New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
This, for its part, responded with serious reproaches: "I would like to say that his own house was a" port "for the illegal." Giuliani replied to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as the group of Republicans does not have a clear favorite so far, the eight pre-presidential candidates take advantage of the CNN debate, especially to discredit their adversaries.
The small 30-second videos, filmed by Internet users who were sent to Youtube, also do not have much content.
"With this way of isolation we let Hitler get to power," that was John McCain's reproach of his adversary Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing the troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding," a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown himself or herself simulate his or her death.
Public reactions in the St. Petersburg room in Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," Romney said, "and asked the people and the television public for forgiveness for being an abortion defender in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani President made himself swear as president.
That's how the eight years of military rule end in Pakistan.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second term of five years.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he took power with an incruent military coup, the former general rules the state for the first time as a civilian chief.
With his resignation from the post of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf met the main status of the opposition and of the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's general prosecutor, after the Musharraf oath, will soon overturn the state of emergency and will meet the second condition of the west.
Since being declared a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many jurists in favour of Musharraf. Last week, the Supreme Court of the country rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four were injured.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the Afghanistan border.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band in the 1970s is still active: three members of "Harmony" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a rerelease, a copy of "Live 1974" was made and was written at the best time of the band.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the feeling.
Each of them has in front of it its little box, its wires and especially its buttons.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On your left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for the passionate Krautrock was the fact that the Harmony band remade music.
What needs to be rebelled here is the following: the questions with precision have shown that the name of the band was in the minds of the people, but it was not so special that after 32 years the public would miss it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the Krautrock equivocal was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to the members of the May 2003 band of Cologne for their work of life, the room could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times it did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it was later achieved thanks to the others.
Already a while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, that promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in Berliner Schaubuehne's basement.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the Neu band! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that was at the time too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in the exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist's life full of surprises.
They say that one day a Harmony of Ottenstein song association banderin appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first albúm was called "Musik von Harmony" and the second "De Lux."
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just to know himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do tests from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in esoterism and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen."
Cluster revived the 1980s and since that time has been more successful than Harmony had.
The live recording of the albúm in Griessmer, that must be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His Grienland music company was set to cultivate this German contribution to preserve it as living music.
As the work of Roedelius, also the Neu! band was again discovered.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidised with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influences of Krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are pictures where Harmony with producers appears on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who began to improvise again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and the battery in order to produce some extraordinary tones with the help of the effect devices they had built with their own hands.
Today, electronic music is the way it had to be.
Three people who deepen the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment he coughes, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis he sings "Aaaaaaaah!."
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the gender was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here cries "68!" is also right, but now Harmony remains calm.
On the stage it is very well reflected on what is already evident.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
That can break one's nerves or give away a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere is only missing more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
But they both didn't have much belief.
Either the concepts are set a lot on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere was again discovered.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man in the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in women's films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument to watch maybe the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he's after" (Why today's movie titles have to be so long and undone?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: deep down, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life had already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decadence had so far preserved most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party," despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
You can tell the film "Moerderischer Frieden" in short: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The sense of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we welcome the fact that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" one can investigate, because there was never really a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another script author (Richard Shepard in two counts), the story about American reporters in the war who are going to detect a Serbian war criminal called "fox," could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now."
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time it turns out to be a journey in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when they first introduce us to Simon Hunt, to whom they do not just let him be a cynical with heart.
No, the script also provides for a love adventure with a Muslim Bosnia that they will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Muslim Bosnians to avenge in a fair way.
It's so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head of a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove it's hard to be good.
The problem is not only the gender of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiasco.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or the minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bleeding Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It has to be at least decades before Hollywood plays a good film about the holocaust, with the example of the film "Schindler's List."
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the Vietnam war works "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not held unanimously as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmor) is presented directly on two home televisions.
And that's because script authors don't have the least repair (which is necessary to be able to) in telling good stories.
"Be or not be" or "The great dictator" were at the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime was.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Maybe you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When they asked him about the parallels between his historical novel "Diccionario de Lempeière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
The great cities will always be in danger, the men will always be killed cruelly and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives in response the negative criticism about the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticism of politics and economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that we have to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday that this resignation was "not good for the economic location."
In the last time, no other project in the big city promoted as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, the political and sports momentum could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time."
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions for the organization of the Summer Olympic Games were not to be held until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but is decided by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) that is expected in early December, on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympic Games.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we had until 2028, from the realistic point of view we will have no opportunity."
"Despite all this, this dream did not end forever," von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity go, if at this point the plans are ruined," said Günter Ploß, the director of HSB, on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception at the general meeting of the German Public Sports Federation (adh).
There von Beust appointed Hamburg's application for universities in 2015 not as "a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sports Federation of higher schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) has reproached the senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the senate was delaying the development of the small district of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social-Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympics gave rise to great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who links the terms Sweden and wooden box, think of Ikea, but don't think of Andy Warhol.
Is that right?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Glow-Box on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Modern Museum of Stockholm carried out internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes," which the former director of the Pontus Hultén Museum gave to the Modern Museum, are false, and almost a cent of the other "Stockholm" type, "which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York City, painted the wooden boxes in red, blue and white, with the same sample that had "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, at the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum, hundreds of Brillo-cardboard boxes were exposed. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol made it possible to produce in Sweden glow-boxes of wood, but they were not exposed at the Modern Museum.
Witnesses from those times now speak of the fact that almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought for over $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Modern Museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they were printed and embellished their tight plates and then they were painted to oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed plates. Moreover, it is not about oil paint, but rather about acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum Museum and adds that if the Authentication Commission "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify these six boxes as the copies / objects of exhibition. "
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which they are soap dust boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had stalled in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The head Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that she could not respond for spilling blood.
The government's loyal soldiers had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had on Thursday trial for having tried a coup in 2003 that ended in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, suddenly to be able to deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police who were to watch him had obviously moved to their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Adviser, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
"People are sick," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to move into our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who used to run the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that the other military troops wanted to follow the march soon.
The great government critics called for a big demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months, his government has been reprimanded for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the riot that was tried against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts at coup d'état against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel's largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for a share is 14, 46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company's absorption.
There are also the options to further increase the financial part in Versatel.
The United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German market for DSL (Digital Subscriber Line).
On Wednesday they already made the assumptions about the entry into the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its participation to the network operator of Duesseldorf by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, that means that the financial institution maintains the securities for a third-party partner.
The United Internet already on the previous day had nearly 10 percent of the company participating in the Drillisch telecommunications company.
Drillisch in the measure of capital increase has placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
The United Internet has bought 5,15 million shares for 31,4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on the marketing cooperation of DSL-products.
"We strengthen our collaboration," the United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday the United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with the participation of ten percent to Freenet and do not use their right, that is, they involve 18.49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially participation in the Freenet public limited company.
Negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the United Internet and Drillisch holding had directly 6.01 percent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch is going to achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment society was already agreed in August.
