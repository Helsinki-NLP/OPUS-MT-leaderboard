Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former Prime Minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia that was disadvantageous to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not yet final, the court of appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code by which the former Prime Minister was convicted was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were required.
The victory of Libya
The story of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to be defined who the winner is.
As is the case in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of eluciating whether it is moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in some way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and the apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, made up of warrior tribes, will be united by the Quran.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot even imagine and which we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and probably it was not in the interests of the Libyans already mentioned.
The fact is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters would accept the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When they seek winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians are using to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals are not in trouble to expel the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies get to get the Libyan black gold just in good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that the West can finally presume to protect human rights.
As long as the Sharia's followers don't cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are on the hunt for the investor search engine
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interfour-year period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, today's bond market has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed in Italy alone, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical cabinets of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's growth by 0.4%
Both countries have made the data for the second quarter public, in Germany it has improved more than expected (0.3% growth rather than 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew annually by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interfour-year period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the ČSU the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic development growth is being shaped.
The results are even worse than the analysts' forecasts.
Main events:
Interannual, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but every four months has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen on an annual basis by 5.2%.
The interest on their ten-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the Czech 10-year bonds remain at 4 per cent, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany, voices are raised that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs are classified for the Eurocup.
They sold 1: 0 and celebrated the classification with a premium of 200 million.
The football team meets the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant doorman Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1: 0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second time, was fantastic in defending itself from the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the European championship appointment.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a thorough report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won by 1: 0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrin did not press until the second half.
The two injured of the party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who passed two large occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup meeting, so the national football coffers will receive a gratification of approximately 200 million kroner.
Since the first few minutes there has been a good offensive game.
Both teams only worked to maintain the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, skates to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense was able to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With his gesture, they would like to express their support for his country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray on Tuesday at noon to the facilities and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human shields around the nuclear technology center where uranium is used.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, by all means, is striving to achieve nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon to the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant, but also the facilities of Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: do not eat breakfast and dinner sausages
More than one third of children aged 9-13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity 5 per cent.
Obese children mostly come from families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current research.
The importance of the environment where it is grown for the healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference, is again demonstrated.
At the table, obsessive children, for example, feed on sausages at least twice as often as children in families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had had French fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence."
In overweight children & apos; s families, there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and nearly 900 children from basic education from all over the Czech Republic participated in the survey.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity of is not a coincidence," supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th grade.
An adequate diet and a lot of exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of children with overweight and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals per day according to the scheme: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with a meatball for dinner
The specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details, which also count, such as having a fixed hour for family breakfast, are important.
In Czech, however, only 23 per cent of school families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households nothing is breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis for a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are used much more often.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink sweet drinks daily (70%).
As a rule, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed do sport, however, their parents enter this result to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal."
Among your favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of sweet drinks is above all alarming," is noted in the final report of the study.
As a main food, the palm is taken away and followed closely by the meat of birds.
Practically, children always reject the leaven and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of the study participants, who completed the questionnaire after the end of the prevention program" Obesity is not a coincidence, "there was in many cases a major change in favour of the principles of healthy feeding," it is noted in the results of the study.
It draws attention, for example, to the sweet drinks, where many children would start to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also more often choose poultry and fish for main food in the questionnaire and would restrict the consumption of fresh food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say
In the introductory article, How the stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three industry professionals, how to dress up troublesome characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final reviews, the more information and practical tasks are waiting for us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the great majority.
Someone is collicorous, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must be able to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves.
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer López, of huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not to dress it too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so much that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it is worth sewing at least one piece of extra fabric to measure.
They will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are unpayable.
With a custom skirt you will feel much better than with one that doesn't stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapes.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the task assigned, I have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he will have to design two locker rooms: one for the day and the other for the night.
The current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question must be taken into account.
It's been my turn to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream on the inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently fattened about a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gómez.
Dresses we have to cut them from magazines or search them on the Internet and print them, and then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, did not only see physically, but also deals, for example, with the pages of products in the magazines (of specific themes, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about all this.
But all this is left by Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the conference on Saturday with information about all types of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist can work with the same garment in different ways.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
So, such a gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed classic with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body in heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or it's enough to rearm her and climb her neck to get a totally different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to first know all the rules."
"Then you can break up," Jakub said.
It is at last clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it then turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than he wants to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are alone, in many cases, half the success.
It is enough to look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In Czech, for the time being, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of the stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not that important).
And when someone asks us for our services, you have to bear in mind that they are very likely to tell us a very different size than their actual (minor) size.
Then there is only guglear and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened / slimmed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to focus on fashion, but must understand outfit.
During his work, he must especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss it, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify the wardrobe and complete it with beautiful clothes, you cannot take and throw away everything that was there and say," What a horror! "
"Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so that someone can put them on," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka," that is, the work bag.
It is fixed around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, cutapellusas, or imperatives. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or caps), special clamps of clothing coupling ahead, if it is greater (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the tissue), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of the shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the study, on a flat surface, the sole and much more the outside could be damaged.
And we did nothing but cover and cover.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skillful.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work without reservation.
The truth is, I'm not very good at those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we've heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that engaging in professional styling is not a pink road, but I don't care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run is competing all over America.
Review
A journey, in principle careless, is complicated by a series of improper carelessness of a routine journey during tomorrow's shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but this is of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was meant to be done.
The new delivery, to which the title is added The Run, raised great expectations already before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new air to the old "Need for Speed" race saga and, as a result of what was shown, appears as a game that should not end up again being a genre of action without more.
We also feel curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks by his own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total computation points are lost because of absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In fact, we cannot even call mistakes, but rather the incomprehensible misgivings of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career all over America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous series deliveries.
So, it's nothing from the other world.
But the desert walk, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, the races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find yourself a sandstorm that reduces visibility.
In the mountains, however, you must be careful not to be buried in an avalanche.
According to that, each race is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a number of required rivals (the normal in a classic race), then you try to earn time (classic timed duel) and then you are expected to have a duel against a single adversary.
In the midst of all this the police sometimes appear, which only makes things more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always by pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far less landscapes in the game than one could expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the traces of the previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you look for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a career conceived with a lot of action is well suited to this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer true for collisions.
From games of this type you cannot expect to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, which is not all in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only light oaks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making out of control.
Or it even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get off the track, the game will return you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race, only five resets are available.
If you consume all of them, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something doesn't go right, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, not even the reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself in some place "civilian" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes the most of all rabies in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent goes forward without problems, but when you arrive, you must either turn or stop.
It's the same when you get there, because it's programmed because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your nose.
The adversaries also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, without taking into account the moment, the same adversary will always advance you in the same place.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at any price.
When he goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come from front, so at first you can make the car paddle.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will probably disappoint you right away.
And it's a shame, because even if the travel model is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow the detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or classification in the race so that it doesn't fit boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the races.
You have to be attentive to the gas dispensers next to the road, because right there you have to change your car, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough of what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and super-sports exotic cars for technical driving, for example, on mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a parallel thread of challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know for the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
By reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, there is an Autolog online function that compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you reach the subway tunnel (pass), where you run in the dark on the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km / h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you comes the subway convoy and you are just taken ahead.
In the writing we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the game's programming none even thought a little or whether the real authors take us for a bunch of bobbles.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
What a shame that, at the most tense times, the quality of the image is reduced and, at times, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents involving many participants, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of their father and mother," but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for their music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble saying that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
The fun is assured, but get ready because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of some airport reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between the individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a barracks to be set up."
"It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, it calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," so the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began her conference at the Law School with conviction.
How not to take his motto "clearly and openly about Europe," which he said at the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, would be the envy of many speakers at the U.S. Carolina Law School.
Vicenová also considered the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing is criticism, that if it is insulting, a grey official, capable of taking on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone unbeatable, because he assumes his roles to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of representative of foreign policy and security is explained on the basis of the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?." This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union for States such as China and India.
No one wants to ban us from Olomouc's cheese.
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda, followed, followed and followed by the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs addressed the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU now has many commitments.
In the Ambassador's words, "a good racket," not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being addressed.
On the other hand, the seven-year budget of the EU, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support and which ones? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe with clarity."
"The truth is, I don't like the ugly abbreviations, the foreigners, or the jargon that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels, either curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes, or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc's cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speed is waiting for us.
According to the ambassador, the Czechs are famous for Eurosceptics and people are more aware of the negative than the positive.
It also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and I get close to a Slovakian, a French next to me, he says," What, you two are left, the Visegrad Group? "and it seems that no grace is done to him."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is awaiting very long-standing new budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is seen as a very real thing of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, rather than the new "European Federation."
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only those countries that they want and those that do not want to cooperate should stay out."
"These procedures will increasingly be and will strengthen the two-speed Europe," is expected Vicenová.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of Czech and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all issues affecting the whole EU should be discussed among the Member States, not just among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that would very precisely define IBM's strategy, the most approximate would be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet a hundred years have passed since its foundation.
The basis of this long-standing character was put by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson,
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised business culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century, "said the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano during his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the businessman of Bahôa in Czech (IBM employees were among the first United States operators to enjoy paid leave, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the relationship with the customer.
From the beginning the company was able to discover talents (being one of the first world companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, which will replace Palmisano next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She's been working at IBM for 30 years, where she's been head of sales, marquets and strategies.
In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, the rain of online ideas, from which the infinity of future strategies and innovations arises.
It is not surprising that ideas are left over, as almost half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technological enterprise," says Harvard Business School's economist and author of the IBM book Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of the consultant Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the US familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies in the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (it develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and services hosting web within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, bar codes and diskettes.
IBM will be billing this year 220 billion dollars. This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first one is Apple), when it first overtook Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just met the customers' taste and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS / 2, online services Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally launched in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano recognized.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don't work, it abandons them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly engaged in services, of which approximately one fifth are of programs and one fifth are of equipment.
However, even in 1990, the teams accounted for more than half of the share of the suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets of a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time the modern global financial crisis was manifested.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first head, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investment.
It seems that IBM has been able to lead the crisis so far.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company's net profit has steadily increased.
IBM's currency is to change everything, except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM history: from the cheese cutter to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 - originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The base that led to the birth of IBM comes from the merger of four companies that go back to the 1880s.
He had inventions like the famous "registration watch," which allows to control the entry and exit of the employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Rankett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory board.
Flint signed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all types of business equipment, from meat and cheese cutters to register boxes.
During the first four years Watson led the company, the billing doubled by $9 million and the large expansion of the company began on the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years later, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA to guide space flights (to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System / 360 series.
The classic "pecés," which established the standard of computers of that time, arrived on the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer full advice and services of high value added.
The strategy IBM has paid for these last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet," that is, "a smarter planet."
Its objective is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances improved, for example, in the transport and management of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM recently presented the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932, he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have had it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtáğ (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but no longer as my partner," said Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted Bartošové in her house during the summer, she could not even imagine how she would end her marriage.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after the first time and Pepe did not leave the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytáł does not care who his wife is sleeping with.
If one day Rychtáł broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not expect him at home with her arms open.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out. "
"But here I would live no longer as my dear and old drunkard who was wrong, but as a man to whom I join certain ties," said Rychtářová, adding that he had already untied his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care that the woman has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I do the house arrangements, I care for the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talk to each other normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtáğ said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, or where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and took full responsibility, "Josef concludes.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that make the blood boil the men?
Go shopping
Do you reproach your orange half that you are dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag a week?
Do you often like to buy at the sales?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to just walk through the clothing shops, look for well-adjusted clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner to wait in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I'd need to lose weight at least five kilos - should I start working out?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't you hear these words?
Is that so?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her look.
It's not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing your partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
It's like an infinite tioviva.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, mop the floor, remove the dust, mop the tub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, for his children who have dirty a newly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that cost him so much to clean?
In case you suffer this "deviation," try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not be occupied to be primordial in the family.
This harmless desire for cleaning could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"The used underpants are left with the dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too."
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If he makes those comets to his partner more times a day, know that he'll get it out of his cells.
You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Maybe, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Pupils and gossip
Some women also have slander, gossip, but also offense and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, that's why they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes gets away with a small, harmless gossip.
With your hand in your heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossip women of those who are not controlled, who love to gossip and often do so, despise all and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women's work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
The hockey front Jaromír Járr participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assists who brought the victory over Philadelphia 5: 3 on the Carolina court and put the Czech players back in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the play of the 39-year-old star, and took one more step and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assists were awarded in the party and also Jágr's partner Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr stated to the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the party, I told him I'd triplet."
"I introduced him."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first shackle of the Flyers.
A while later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček made the record behind the Hurricans' doorway and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who put goal.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After working with Jágr, he put in the third goal, after his shot went through Wayne Simmonds' doorway room.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best player on the court, but he's certainly among the best three," Jágr weighted his station.
"It never would have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very pleased with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my partners were playing for me, and that now produces results, "Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, of penalti, to get to a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up outnumbered in two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and read went to the far side."
"I tried to fit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead of the East Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an injury to the upper body.
The Canadiens not only lost one player with a lot of defense experience, but also for a difference of two goals, 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Anyway, but that's not what we can do, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the disk out of our field."
"And so we left gaps," explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
The doorman Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5: 2 victory over the Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were marked by five players who thus ended a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time sold in most cases only trips to the socialist bloc, as the travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime leaned west and the trips of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also the Czech Republic) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual travel was not possible.
The travel agencies offered in those days also trips to the West, but one had to line up with a sleeping bag and spend like this all night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people," who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way of travel of the Czechs has been a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was the no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that the current favorite destination, Croatia, could not travel freely until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, visa exemption was imposed for travel to neighbouring Western European States, leading to a huge wave of short-term visits, particularly to Vienna or Germany.
The Czech Slovaks, for a long time, did not see themselves fed up with the West excursions, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czech groups were sleeping in the parks in tents, as our then income did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take with them food (conserved, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it also the average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in the demand for travel, the agencies began to prepare the travel regularly from 1997 using the charter flight connections, which led to an incredibly low travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90's last century, the Czechs were already travelling without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the US, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have taken place every year, making countries far away and warm. This winter will already be flown directly from Czech to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, more than 15 thousand Czech kroner per head have been spent on foreign travel, including expenses at the stay site.
Convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up again in a dead end.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without President and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the next Special General Assembly will be convened on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without these, it will not be possible to vote even to choose from among the three candidates.
Those interested in chairing Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from office in June not without first calling his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Hašek era, a dispute was unleashed between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was made clear on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prussian district of Sméchev, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that point on, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation was no longer able to shed any more on the Executive Committee than, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, it basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute is about whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy will win.
The Moravia Region is ready to make a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemia side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," that is how Svoboda understands the objections of the moravian side, according to which it would best not to touch order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With what has been said, he also agrees with Tomaš Paclík, although the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be more appropriate to Pelta.
"I would like it to be voted to the maximum in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who runs for the first time as a candidate and leads his observations mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk, the new president will be decided and he believes that future candidates will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be appeased with today's match of our national team at the European Championship.
"Football will again be a leading player, and this will be the way to cooperate more at ease," says the representative of the Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in managing football, both at the professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not the conflict between bohemians and moravos, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a further blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyway, I hope common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is no longer much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among other vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which they say will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parts into the country's most powerful sports organization for agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) that will try to give a new direction to Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka Lotteries House.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If Pilsen's head of football players, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of an appropriate candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not stand as a candidate for such a relevant post.
"If there was a right person, I would be fighting for her and not run for election."
"But to this day there has been no such person," Paclík said for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to go into the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that if he were to win, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I could take into account."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that at the moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What is supposed to be most disturbing to Paclík at the moment is Pelta's relationship with Pilsen Roman Berbr's Regional Football Association President, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobist with the ability to influence the delegates' vote in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a telephone call during the investigation of a corruption case, of which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will the UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "I would sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta became president."
In the event of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
The other candidate, Rajchl, has also been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly, which ended up in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as the head of the representation."
"but not as an association manager."
"I don't get my nose in where I don't feel capable," added Paclík, who in September attracted a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Commission of Arbitrators chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He has made use of his capacity to manage private companies, since he has been the Director of Pilsen since last summer, who, with his support, celebrated the first division victory in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some lobbyists, who probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding their antipathies to Sparta President Daniel Křétinský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the Czech Olympic Committee and FAČR, with the help of which it put pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be devoted."
"If taxes on gambling were to increase, as the political parties have announced, I would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be "non-partisan."
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I see no sense in the fact that I hypocritically give up my actions of the Pilsen Club to another person and then go back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve, in the future, disputes regarding electoral rules.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-electoral conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could go well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People at all levels have been working on football for a long time and are looking forward to meeting the new President this Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who mainly associates with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly adopted the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have had a president since September," Pelta said.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win over delegates.
"If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond in case this fails."
"It is a question of principles, without which we cannot exist," Pelta says.
Also, in theory, try not to mess with your opponents.
He had already warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respected for his training in law, and was aware that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
He had not been attacking Thomas Paclík for a long time, who, contrary to Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already made some hits."
"Their attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon, according to him, is his knowledge of football, from lower to higher competitions.
The latter should be a football promotion window.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose from the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all the football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not lead to any personal changes in the staff.
"He would first have to know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are being evicted before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in its career as representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working with desire.
If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected in the fourth General Assembly as the new President of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, in case of election, hard work would be done.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It also undertakes to resolve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or the training of young high-performance football players."
"I don't mean that I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can engage in a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not rerunning as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because then others would give up too."
"It's about having faith not to leave like this, just like that," he said.
They say it also motivates him to continue the work that he already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, a large part of the work that I don't want it to be lost now was finished."
"There are processes that had begun and will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like to have someone stop them," he announced concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again as it was before the Hašek era.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
"Behind him is especially all those people who would take care of football so that it would be just a privilege for a few chosen."
"I can be reproached for a lot of things, but not for the fact that I'm in favour of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do a football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact that the second division is divided into one Czech part and another morava, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would not be the current situation in which we have only three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the struggle in the presidential elections, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel like I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice-president and which knows that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving a few billion kroner of disadvantageous contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his part of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he assesses his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
I jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Pool from an incredible, sumptuous view in Budapest: Anyone who visits Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling bathrooms.
A book shows where the best well-being in the water is.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missed in his luggage, a swimmer.
She was lying on the water, looking at the artistic dome on the top, swimming towards the marble angelotes, which were waiting for her on the edge of the pool and was astonished at the indoor modernist pool meticulously restored.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presented them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "trip through the most extraordinary baths of Centroeuropa" in 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a real fan of bathroom culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that bathroom fans have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stink, while running fans can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the happy trines of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the pools have to be always so ugly," says this resident of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The chapoteo in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The welfare factor in the pools is so great because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of the floor, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
It all folds optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, mainly, makes it feel like jumping into blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
In addition to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath of Budapest, the waters are found with nitrates in a unique karmic cavity (baths in cages in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as hot springs, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are found in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászbereny).
Many discovered swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city looks at the roofed pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow covered, from the outside pool of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which you can see the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: The water cathedral of Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources, steam rises in winter, while the Ötztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the oil plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose légamo sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for nice places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered pools and sun baths in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschoolwitz, he found a blocked terrain.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbled windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the weeds grow between the tiles.
Decadence contrasted in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three stages of construction behind them; not only can you discover Neo-Oromanic elements of the times of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall of Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural to the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion into the thermal pool apparently is not of much importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For the citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84% of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the world hunger problem.
The consumer defender's campaign is directed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, the bets on raw materials were thought to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and make profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism in a different way than the US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise the good fame of Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The stakes at increasing food prices show in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks are currently damaging public welfare."
Ackermann is found as the largest bank lobby, especially in the bonds.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all the investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money into play for food price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of people who are hungry or the Deutsche Bank's fame."
The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank published that the president of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation, it can perfect its image.
And he needs you to give a damn about possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have been involved in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were placed.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
43 percent would disadvise a bank like this to their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and change to another institute.
The 21 house in Vienna
The moved flag
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
The architecture of modern postgerra apasione, the clear forms, the crystal finds, the brave curves and the new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
Construction is so far considered a contemporary milestone of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the South Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and within a 20th-century museum was inaugurated, the "house 20" was called.
The building was suitable but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, not a good environment.
However, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is increasingly decaying.
At present, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calling it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, was inaugurated a coup d'état in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, has achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, ice skater in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are presented, there should be a cafe and a bookstore and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he significantly reformed Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna, he extended it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place," where he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are great problems, the building was "an energy devour," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass façade windows was changed, a glass-reinforced insulating glass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly like it used to be.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
"He often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The "which came from Brussels" pavilion has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the right consciousness."
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, a coup of urban luck has happened. The completely new and planned "central station neighborhood," with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another coup of luck: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as we hear, deals with the city on a neighbouring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid the train failures in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the breakdowns and delays of the trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments up to 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
In order to achieve a better availability of the vehicles and the railway network even with an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees to 16,000 places to remove the snow from the tracks and the platforms.
The aim is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, President of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays also during this winter following a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, he was lacking in reservations to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train was broken by an axis at the central station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays US dollar fines
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, the Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (€106 million) in an agreement, to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCUA financial market regulation recriminates many large banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag the banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of the NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US credit cooperatives and provides support in case of bankruptcy to protect customer investments.
The NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also called on other large banks to account and, in the summer, brought proceedings against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of doubtful mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the US real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the destruction of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, today a complicated wind blows for American banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or to punish misdemeanours.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of demands.
It rebukes the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a FHFA demand, which is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses," without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests strongly in the IBM Information Technology company.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer and Information Technology companies, as the forecasts of the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's commercial report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and seeks computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
The first of Information Technologies should therefore be called "Sir IBM."
Buffett currently unveiled on the CNBC economy station that has acquired IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investment Berkshire Hathaway has thus promoted one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the engagement so far.
He commended the leadership that addressed the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established the services of lucrative information technology such as the operation of calculation centres.
The old 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he was only investing in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricants manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, extended it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors all over the world.
His quick and infallible sense to make money has provided him with the nickname "Omaha's oracle."
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock stock stock stock increased by one percent.
"The Blue Giant," as IBM is known, has a stock exchange value of over $220 billion and is, together with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell," the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that rekindles itself.
The murders of eight small business tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, it has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was thought to have been dead long ago has returned, since the fire-like attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence with far-right background against Turks had occurred.
However, there has never been any question of xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-decoy network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were far from predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology rekindled again?" headlines the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah" on the contrary points out that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, on the weekend it reminded the victims of the racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with the German and Turkish politicians, reflected on a solemn event on the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was put on the scene with happy colors, as a story with a happy end.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German issue "Hürriyet" also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
"It starts to smell bad," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in the search are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not sought long before suspects in the circle of the ultra-right.
Some are less rhetorical in terms of the drastic media: "From now on, it is lost, immigrants are left with no more than self-defense and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the punishment to the entire network," writes "Selen."
This means that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks who live here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the group sentiment of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the main criticism was that German policy was lacking after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire-like attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the German Turks contribute to the taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his or her taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media again shows how deep it has since been the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time we need free words.
The Zürich Lake scandal bank
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost broke into the financial crisis and since then it has slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was known that in 2013 he would start in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the administrative board of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly happy, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired strength and drops friendly observations about its future partners.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the security systems of the bank and let down 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general director of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the USB's administrative board has since been considered equally touched, and they all asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the administrative board in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and counselor and has had a period of adaptation that is certainly necessary.
He suddenly takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just again proved that it deserves the title "the largest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, for years, it has been slipping from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is saved to the former so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss property manager discrete and solid, but also timid, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with 1.6 billion dollars, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banking professor in Zurich for many years, explains: "In front of my students, I have always described USB as a model for a good bank."
"From the present point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, general director, who until then was considered a great and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this, he found investors, of course, that some looked with contempt until soon before: an Asian and opaque state fund in Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second best paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its misinvestment, the UBS was in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values from the UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for an obligatory convertible bonus, by which it became a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, he said how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitalized in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly let down taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS more or less confessed to having helped in the tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the President of the Board of Directors and the President of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of the customers' funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the banking of investments through misspeculation and in the administration of goods through the aid of tax fraud.
And just when it was a little quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS was going to get it again, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator let down 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still doesn't work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers have long been present, has emerged to be the guardians of the world's greatest goods: no risk too great, however, the security of money wants to break down on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS power station in Zurich does not fit the cliché of the Swiss solid private bank, it is only a little older.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat on Bahnhofstraße Street in Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to Zurich Lake, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry shops like Tiffany's between traditional Swiss businesses like the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been residing here for years: from the national bank, through the Palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS by means of a heavy swivel door.
Inside the walls are covered in marble, in front of you are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo there is a large sign to indicate "security."
The UBS knows what the client is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the great Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both large banks.
The UBS has become too large, he believes, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxon have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long been used to the customs of the Anglo-Saxon."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hässig wrote in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you think of that?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different UBS precursor banks: a rich but asleep bank with the center of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could make a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Administrative Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Opel were a perfect team," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one that managed to make way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: the slack arrived before the case.
The UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of directors, at which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: "Get down from the throne to Goldman Sachs."
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They were leading the League Tables, the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps worked out for him.
In foreign exchange operations and in the trading of shares it was at the top.
However, the company advisors in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income," there is huge compensation for large banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid of growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine to securitise American mortgage credits and then sell them, keeping certain risks to its own account.
And also, like other banks, he sought the downfall for a long time.
"In summer 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The UBS posts were turned into projectable seats and are unsafe to date.
Currently, the one who runs a big bank has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, to end investment banking, to focus on property management, to return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to be reduced a lot, it is clear today.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must permanently run the business of the UBS, the bank of Zurich reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Abolish 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask today.
So far he's just saying he'll first find a house with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The imminent recession in Europe has scared American investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome are still not in force.
The steady industrial production on the continent stifles the hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis at its origin.
The general relief on changes of government in Rome and Athens may not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been seen half-full, not half-empty, but now the problems are going back to a close-up, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First and foremost, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values closed with a decrease of 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.

The companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat statistical office.
What created skepticism among American investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are also more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of investments, only confirmed this caution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for the CNBC.
It is therefore too early to invest in State loans or European banks from the point of view.
Instead, it overthrows a decade of old principles and enters the American technology sector.
Its investment of more than 10 billion dollars in IBM supports the contribution of the traditional consortium's shares and makes it contribute against the trend in the market at first just a higher percentage.
The value closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

Smart grabs spread in cities
In many places the shackles are considered "problematic birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, the experts say.
Some people like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the shackles have been in the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors for the shit and the noise of the animals are accumulated.
Although no means has appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
The shackles no longer leave the cities, say the experts at the first symposium on shackles in Leer, Eastern Frisia.
There specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the countryside of certain protected crates; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing building and falling trees that host them make the lives of birds difficult.
The shackles are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005, a controversial project to mass killing of the district's shackles jumped to the negative headlines of the press.
Critics have described the hunting of animals through bird traps and the killing of sticks as especially brutal.
"Expand them away in a normal way, nothing is achieved," said Werner Klöver, an urbanist and a landscape player from Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing the trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are diverted, the great colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Ahuyentlos is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, old people's homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination of removing animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to resettle elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertise against it in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a peak on the face with aplomo."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on the Ascheberger crates, where signs report on the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the shackles not only take advantage of the resources to access shale bites, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, etologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four shackles to where the intelligence of the birds comes from.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning grabs had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva on a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get to their prey with their beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they caught the cube on the tube shooter.
Three of the four shackles got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in the 2012 Eurocup thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
Favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at the 2012 Eurocup.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest euro 2012 banknotes in the play-offs in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the one-way party, made the five participations of the Eurocup in a row.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs back game with the outsider Montenegro, after the one-way game (2-0) made things clear.
Croatia did not let them mark it in 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a 1-1 (1-0) loose against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) marked the other goals of Portugal.
The former Bundesliga professional, Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalti (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice to Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South African world play-offs.
In Lisbon's Light Stadium, Portugal began in a perfect way.
Ronaldo executed a direct free from more than 30 meters to get to the head at the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his endowments to mark from afar and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not look in the first half of the hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, the English leader Manchester City, sent a head to the stick, but the ball did not cross the front line (33.).
Jiracek succeeded for the Czech Republic
Then, the collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the yellow card to the Portuguese (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitched a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the rest, the 2004 European vicecampeon clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt at the 81. minute with the goal of Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for the Eurocup.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the legendary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Peghart (1. FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the doorman Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at the door of Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic marked at the 40th minute of the front turn, very just at the gate of Cech.
After the break, the Czechs had to protect the world-famous goalkeeper, FC Seoul's front man escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end the party was sentenced.
Meanwhile, Turkey took advantage of the wonder of Zagreb's football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that the national coach Guus Hiddink was to leave his seat on the 2002 World Cup third party, the Croats held their fourth participation in the final of the Eurocup.
In the face of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance chute, Selcuk Inan only managed to play the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball inside the doorway.
After the second reaction, Croatia was increasingly in control.
After the pause, Croatia did not let any goal be put in it.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, which in the 6th minute made room for Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Eurocup
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first participation in the Eurocup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who triumphed with 4-0 in the one-way game prepared for a previous decision, to head in the 32 minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but it must have waited until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the very first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he got ahead of him.
After a defense of the doorman Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and sucked the ball across the line, getting the 1-0.

"We will get more research and development facilities and hire workers," said Bill McDermott, co-president, at a conference in Beijing.
Staff should grow from 2,500 currently to 4,500.

Massacre at the personal level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one fall his soul at his feet.
Here are some acting tips: Gently start this page and make it your brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will work as your GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments when, as one of your men and women, you are confused and unprotected in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you have written here is an unusual book, which rightly describes as "a work of anti-history."
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and states of humor."
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines the experiences in times of war of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go crazy or die.
Their lives blink here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War was only the flawed war of trenches on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves in an expert way through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book have the hives on them; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war inundated the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a Katrina hurricane that stinks of cordita.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, are you staying or are you running away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why we have to fight this war.
"Lack of facts," says Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
Their stories have been obtained for the most part from memories, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or touching, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and dealing with what there is.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says, "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee successor, fake aluminium, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about food happening in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in ram fat (and topped with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dry potatoes; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, it notes, "837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 registered substitutes for coffee."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and manifests about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit on armchairs with a cigar and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that this varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched and tasted breast."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing himself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar to "a condemned person being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass killer with good clothing that executes his butcher while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and embed with it their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often gives rise to a blindness for life."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way in which the war "unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels like No novelty on the front of Erich María Remarque, instead of comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund's volume is attached to an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of non-fiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if I had come from his book, ripped from between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and burned it with a match.
After a false previous step, a planned assault a minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen on the night of Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence highlighted how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks, such as the spraying of pepper on the protesters, could not be repeated, violating the regulations of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "okupas."
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared to see how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking at Zuccotti.
The officers increased so-called disorder training - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park arrived at the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
"To the few cops I know were called for this, they didn't tell you what it was to get into Zuccotti Park," the person said, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, agents wanted to clear the park, but they stopped when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually used to flood high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making the 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when there were the least number of people in the park," he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with spotlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The prerecorded lights and messages that were lying from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
The community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue short, many protesters just picked up their things and left.
"No store was played until 1: 45 a.m.," the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting at the perimeter to enter if there was a need to make arrests in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from taking action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the densely fangled personal effects of the protesters, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags filled with clothing, the cleaning department teams followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, showing up images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were blindfolded by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
The emergency service agents were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3: 30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disorderly public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking agent at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief detective, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he wasn't running the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were raised on Cortlandt Street, a block to the north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block to the south.
From these positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the north perimeter.
Some of the noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a plywood piece flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protestor were hospitalized.
The support workers' union will sue the city for redundancies
The union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
The lawsuit is, possibly, the last weapon at the disposal of the union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their job on October 7, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city's access to a health care fund by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this charge.
At a City Hall hearing last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said that redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council counter-attacked him by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the school support staff would be fired.
Municipal District 37 officials said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the claim, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as accused, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on his specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been chronically underfunded.
It is noted that while there were no redundancies in Staten Island and a few redundancies in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the 36 Public School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The 36 district budget was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated the additional funding for each enrolment per poor student in schools.
The union also states that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of the parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more often describes the act of moving a school payroll teacher to a labour exchange, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," says the draft complaint, "and not just in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muamar el Gadafi to be captured and killed, and the United States participation came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Massachusetts Democrat), along with senators John McCain (Arizona Republican) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut independent), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is to honor the brave of Libya, as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties were fighting each other and with the White House about the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, which never came to vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected a measure that would have cut the funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in some kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress bothersome enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not so angry as to actually sew the grass under his feet.
The Congress's indecision was then overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide the legislators as did the June bill?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's main Republican.
The Lugar spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that in fact achieves a vote of the whole assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially novice Republicans seeking to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can fulfil, while representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for the presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as is one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111st Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - on 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Hit but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at the back of a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang with the Broadway melody "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News "20 / 20," with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked him how he feels, 41-year-old Giffords answered, "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special one-hour "20 / 20" program, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new couple's book, "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope."
The special program analysed the recovery of Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar passing through her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers upright, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A frunction of the lips.
And then his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords said another word - "toast," a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: The congressman is seen singing together with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading Giffords an article from the newspaper about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of her wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said," 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,' "said Kelly.
"You've just been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back more forcefully than ever. "
Troops make you feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines broke into their posts around him.
The hashtag crowd stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint General Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were shown as some kind of orphan child," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken over the military and a often distant, sometimes adoring, American public.
He proclaims himself to the troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, say the members of the service.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were sorry for those uniformed.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or in disagreement with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the talk about pity takes place in silence and in private among war veterans.
After his two children returned from fighting with the Marine Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cantian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an "angry and violent veteran under the surface," said Cantian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him whether he would be able to stand under the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative impressions," Cantian recalled by telling his children.
Military restlessness, in part, arises from American indifference to wars.
The achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing growing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historical audience will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to the rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
"An alarm signal rang," Lyman says.
However, the Texas native set aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, throwing her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and old military personnel are eagerly awaiting a court decision at a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the suit they have against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The claim is that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but it grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he's going through the big plane of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from top to bottom," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, you will present several cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or old soldiers for injuries to the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active staff.
"The alleged damage is part of the military service of the plaintiffs," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the '50s.
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear lines of the front.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernise, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are on the move, in addition to her.
At Yale Law School, the Veteran Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a complaint in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the way she handles claims for benefits for persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a two-party mix of senators and representatives, proposing a number of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual attacks, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the attacks are reported below, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which amount to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also reviews the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 per cent of cases reported in the army were brought to trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first in a series of trauma.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and the blood of her attacker - from a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work." I found myself screaming from the living room. "
"They put me in the psych unit, and when I left, I remember I told my commanding officer," "That wasn't his trial. That was my trial."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who was finally diagnosed with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was dispensed from service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow lawmakers continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not on its way, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will put his other hundreds of plaintiffs in line for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just get on Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report on European digital populism by the British study centre DEMOS.
Facebook's personal information cache is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups all over Europe and then directed them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
On arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry by immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
DEMOS's work is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in "Like," messages on walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to find people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to go through the party, and they would never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, found that university students who spoke about their drunkard feats on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student publish too many state updates with their drunkards.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Centre for Health, Behaviour and Child Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "clicking" on its own population to get data.
The Site's Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders long ago that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for all.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be looking at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with public student Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there's the question of methodology.
Even off-line, there is no guarantee that a research theme is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of a user's profile information and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper bra and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to the real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of the social still happens out of line."
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" combatant during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said to a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, forbade him from access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked in.
They all attended with the aim of moving towards conclusion.
"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian station NRK.
"It was awkward, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mental patient, and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a relative of a victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs's lost interview, shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius from technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently rediscovered to which it has been dusted as a advance of a series of special projections in the larger markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and workflows of the products.
He was certainly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of the flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triumph of the Nerds) on the opening of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs died that a full copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This file material, slightly reedited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview that reaches the Landmark cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also moments when the perfectionism of Jobs comes to the surface, where it seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing it to go faster to the most important issues or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic about the lost interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computer.
One thing is to read posthumous assessments of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked," Why do you do things? "and the answers they give you invariably are," Oh, that's just the way it's done. "
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting into detail.
Disconcerted by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of a good cuber, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
On the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been written widely about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here by describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half a dozen times and yelled through the public phone and went back a minute later to the public phone next door," says Jobs with a little laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two of them broke out in the face just before the Pope himself was awakened to go and answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and the phone sale with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a little cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, a client asked him if he could set up the whole team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, remember the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and left and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before he led the Apple Renaissance, Jobs prophetically anticipated how many industry leaders would stumble into their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, so what?"
You have a monopoly of market share, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position will rot because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make electrons, glass makes them, robots make them, factories make them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end everything is reduced to taste - it is reduced to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.
What in part made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were casually the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with the health-care law rivals while the court accepts the case
The day the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were held at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to study in detail the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a cry of war for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit to the application and, in fact, a historic 5 and a half hour plea is expected by March, and the result will probably further entrench the 2012 presidential career, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law must be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as US Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees were Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opposition to the health care law.
The special guests at dinner?
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge can attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor, or be on the program of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was sufficient to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive gap of ethics and indifference to the code runs counter to the demands of several judges who abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"The judges were paid in a gala fund-raising with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticism that they say they too easily mix the court's activity with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a leading conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
Their critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law to be impartial for now.
Kagan has not given any indication that he will.
Boeing receives a record order of 18 billion dollars
The Emiates airline calls for 50 Boeing 777 double-corridor aircraft, with a choice of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at over a billion dollars.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big transaction when the company is the Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the sale price for the 50 planes is up to a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a growing gold mine from future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend his largest order in history for commercial aircraft for its dollar value - 50 Boing 777 double-aisle jets.
The successful order came from the Emiates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to 26 billion dollars, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which presupposes a fuel saving and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is over a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the highest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The UAE request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide fuselage aircraft market and helps keep the attempt of its competitor Airbus SAS to invade its domain with the A350 passenger plane at bay.
Boeing's victory at the air fair takes place four months after Airbus said he was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in the Michoacán vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor's fight.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy for Michoacán's governor during the violent state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped to lean the race for one of her opponents.
The preliminary results led in the race for governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview a day after the Sunday vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers, they took over the ballot boxes, they set up barricades, and they ordered people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have overtaken Calderon, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, was third, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against the traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates left the local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, no matter how unpleasant the Michoacan elections look, a victory will help to drive the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two largest growth economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "fair" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
European monetary union has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's debt costs have increased dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power for the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from the fall in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the University of Brown in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the one billion two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs in poorly managed companies and loss-generating companies such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens "major chain effects" throughout Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011 / 12 now faces "downside risks" due to Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible cuts in defense
Defense Secretary León Panetta heated the Congress on Monday, warning that the coming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and cause a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the Afghanistan battlefields, to the civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now it fears an additional reduction of $600 billion or more in cuts that can be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to senators John McCain, a Republican by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican by South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping," would lead to 23 per cent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unable to be implemented - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to unintentionally separate many of our civilian officials and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to release civilians in order to meet the goal."
"These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage good disposition."
The cuts over time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While war-time funding in the overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by the serious disruption of the base budgets," Panetta said.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contract supporting the war."
"Payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's main military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a result that can be lived with, and certainly it is not one that we must impose on ourselves."
"Kidnapping is a threat to the interests of the United States national security, and it must not be allowed to happen."
If Panetta's letter and recent senators' warnings will increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify the calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts, it is still to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more frank about possible cuts, even though she came to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that she was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with the potential adversaries."
"Indeed, he calls for aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions "generate important operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed worldwide; and represents an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and further testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it's the next vital step to improve and address the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent are deception and lie in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging charges of sexual harassment with several women; each side is accused of lying to the other.
The administrators of Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually attacking children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was "caught" with an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist, Anthony Weiner, made a fool of himself with his fast-to-rebuttal dissidents for the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramatrimonial relationship.
And again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The legends about the traps in the school and university exams are very widespread.
There have been cases in which teachers have given the test responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that the unknown were lying three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies," is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have You," the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that old myths about lie have been rebutted.
Liars do look into the eyes.
They don't always stutter, chew, blush or worry.
It cannot be concluded either that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can reach the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation and times.
I spent several years looking at scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if its professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented lies," while women say more "self-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than non-married people (but the lies they often say tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evil, the others will feel less guilty in lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual conduct of the subject.
This is called "creating a baseline."
It helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the subject's position, laughter and vocal feature.
You better know if someone usually hits with their feet all the time to not make unfair accusations when I see their feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal and non-verbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the top of the body by trying to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change their position significantly, or exhibit a "post-interview exhale" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all difficult questions are over.
The interrogators often falsely see that the interview is over only to seek that post-interview relief.
It also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up to the bottom and used the time past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her nationally.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I... understand."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- enraging the unions, while appeasing the environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to redirect it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline outside the environmentally sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and it is confident that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's manager, Alex Pourbax, says that the company maintains its confidence that over time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision for a federal project permit until new potential routes to avoid the areas of Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of underground water are studied.
"This is a true way forward," said representative Lee Terry, Nebraska Republican, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
To do so, it would be necessary for him to cross six states.
It is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a distance from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project had only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's general inspector has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada's member of the lobby, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that the disco music diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a crazy woman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrorizing her little daughter to the point that she threw up in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's diatribe scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," says her family at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was on November 10 last year that tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said he stood near the door and put his daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? 'I said "yes' and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
"He said in an aggressive tone," I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door, "Roseanna Monk said.
"I said," I have no interest in what you say or think. "
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle over me. "
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman," Look what you've done to my daughter, "said the girl's mother.
LaBelle bowed on the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her environment and removed to a car that was waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damage, but family lawyer Sam Davis said that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money he gets to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
"This type of conduct is completely unacceptable, especially when it is addressed to a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate Adversity Stopped the Economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has dropped and the economy has contracted
The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-called of change, which generated high expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost effects issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582 thousand 835 hectares were damaged, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main sinister crops were vegetables, corn and garbanzo.
The fall in economic activity has led, until November, to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year has been accelerated, as while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate has increased to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average has continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in the number of people has dropped to more than 74 thousand Sino69, compared to the first half of the 969.
Reduced liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the purposes of a resource restriction by the legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, as for people who illegally grab dollars it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes noted that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties in entering, and second because they are already having a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people are staying and demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloese labour market is aggravated by the high level of informality that predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state work without being listed as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour delays are low wages, the entity has the lowest remuneration in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contract
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decline in foreign direct investment over the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of State FDI amounted to $630 thousand 697, a fall of 87.74 percent from the $5 million 143 thousand 312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the State Government's Secretariat for Economic Development accounts for a total investment of 17 billion pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In the context of economic contraction, the state government applied in July to the State Congress for the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos, which would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of the will of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa this year has really been very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we have to align the effort of all and especially the already synchronized good march of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic clarity
Loredo López stated that events like the early year's frost stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including the frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the National Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to be done
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better links the Government's efforts.
"In general terms I would say that the Government has been working to achieve good results in different areas, there are some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I believe that the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He's been convicted for 8 kgs of marijuana.
Five years in prison and 100 days in fine, a neighbor of Navolato was sentenced for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
La Procuraduría General de la República informó que el narempeudista condenado es Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, por el delito de contra la salud, en su variant de posición de mariguana para fines de comercio.
According to the file AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80 post, in the village El Castillo, Navolato.
The narempeudist was circulating in a white pick-up truck, where he had a black bag in the vehicle's box and in the copilot's seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was made available to the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains in the Centre for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Must contribute to works
The social works envisaged in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk because the State Government has not complied with its contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of these programmes becomes effective.
"It is almost 12 million that they have to contribute, and even though the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they must have given us a part," he said, "we have started the works in order not to delay and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions they had, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide at that time.
"It happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State left behind," he said.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten efforts to ensure that their percentages were reached as soon as possible.
"It is almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth."
Valid cut "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advance the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, by not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television more concrete.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected because it did not reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this is in force.
The draft judgment, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the reservation of law.
In favour of the project only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the application brought by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Minister-President said that he did not agree with the project's arguments that the federal executive could not structure the measures for the preparation of the public administration through general rules.
"I also do not consider that if it did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the State's leadership.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years, and results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he said, "require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic rectification of the State, includes a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, is providing in the administrative sphere for the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PRP the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records.
The possibility of "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Program (PRP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is just 27 percent, even without the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (ICES), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline to enable them to enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the State Official Newspaper Act, on the grounds that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislature and called the state president's vote "invalid and illegal" to constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "punish or veto them."
Interviewed about the possibility of "vote by vote," María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the ICES it will be possible to make partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given in cases where: the results of the minutes do not match; there is no record of scrutiny and computation in the file of the box or does not hold the office of the president; or, where there are obvious errors or changes of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all polling stations may be made where there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate who won the election in question and the candidate who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the party representative and / or coalition who nominated the second of the candidates.
The total count of the vote may also be made if, at the end of the ordinary ballot, it is established that the difference between the candidate alleged to be the winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was the second, in which case the electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation there is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PRP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16%, but without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.

Three abandoned bodies are located on Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the finding, the military authority submitted to the media 11 persons who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot and killed in different parts of the body and with the shooting of grace, in an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find occurred at the 1.5 km of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.

One of the individuals dressed in a yellow shirt with a dark-minced pants, with no shoes; next to him was another with a white-strung shirt.
A few meters away was the body of another individual with a red shirt and blue mingle pants.
All three of them were face down.
De acuerdo a las datos objetivas en el loco, las tres personas habrían sido asesinadas en otra loco, ya que no se encontraron casquillos en el loco.
In the bard of the fifth one can see legends that are directed from one organized crime group to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
They catch 11 in Cadereyta.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster
The designated Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the brink of the economic disaster and put the entire eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said that he will present the President with the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well delineated," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard austerity package required by European leaders to regain the beaten confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put the performance of the Italian BTP bonds to 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were considerably driven by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the central right-wing party, to the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will probably be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure to warn that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
It will end your round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
To save Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before they advance the elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be made up only of technicians, an indication of their reluctance to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish population is higher than the Spanish population.
Of the 22 so-called Spanish football players, ten are over 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side only one of the 22 convoked reached the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to Costa Rica, compared to the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly, at 3: 05 p.m., in the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly ranking, account for a wide record of class A interselections games, the Tricolor only has defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international parties.
This figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish football players who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England keep up with intense activity in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as Champions League.
In addition to this, the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated eliminations of the Eurocup and the World Cup is added.
On the other hand, football players have a limited international rock in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish team is from the archer Iker Casillas, who the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equated the record of the ex-porter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today in front of the Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, the Barcelona brain wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenary of the Iberian team, the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the Squalke's Aiet, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost near the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz gunner, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, there are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet debuted.
The historical scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 dianas, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records more with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in his two-decades-long tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band claims that for them it will also be to make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was assured by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located on the South American wing of its two-decades-of-work tour and on Sunday 20 it will make its only scale in Central America.
That day they will be presented at the National Stadium, from 7: 30 p.m., next to the angelin band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose complete transcription is on The Nation on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true to us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I've been in Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're gonna be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I ask you because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensively the previous days.
What do you tell your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
When they watch the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this for?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have long not played, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've achieved?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagine we'd be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years now that it looks like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the grunge's emergence?
It's always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's something unusual.
From time to time, a band from a city comes up, but it's much more strange when five or ten bands leave at the same time from one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them once in a while.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them yet and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like you will stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we're all lucky to be still alive and, second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give each one freedom to experience.
We trusted each other with each other's music and could not be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too touring because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without being captivated for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think of the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and more.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he can think of.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many of them.
Among the first to come up with are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassist I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge relevant even though it's not already a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's a wonderful thing because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now doing better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that's dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is reinstated for medical examinations
Former president Alberto Fujimori was placed on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle force that he has in his legs, his doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a language cancer for which he has been operated four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the N TV Channel that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of force of its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in her opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, she said that he did not want it because he is known to be innocent.
It was operated four times of cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs have been joined, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years & apos; imprisonment for the death of 25 people by an army annihilation squadron, which he operated illegally in the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official conference, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin on Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community resident in Mexico, according to the agenda spread by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will "be conducive to the exchange of information in all that is the political affairs between the two nations," according to the South American presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that led to Uruguay's rejection and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has since November chaired the G20, a group of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigotudo plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he has never done so in three dimensions to date: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to shops all over the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without wearing glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally thought for that support," since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations to existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and smooth game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook up the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced will be able to give a "second round" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, which is that the moustache plumber will have to go through dangerous mined platforms with the aim of releasing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom supports Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had processed the extradition of former ruler Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy to wash US $70 million.
This is the end of the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the country of the north that was demanding Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was due to the independence of the judiciary and executive, taking into account that a court of judgement had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term he "did not put his hands" into court decisions and dealt with all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did meant was an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional bodies had been exhausted to prosecute the former President from 2000 to 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process leading up to extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of untrained children
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this fourth century.
In addition to this, the 100 long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held in the old Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of degree or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions who have worked with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the exconseller of socialist education, Ernest Maragall, and the senior mayor and current ecosocialist councilman Ricard Gomà.
The current conseller of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the great room of the Fabra i Coats.
But he said that Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the present time is also so, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president set Trinijove as an example for being able to fight the bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evacuated an okupada estate where they were made great parties
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm on noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the neighbors of the 51 Street of Balmes lived has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the property they occupied illegally on noon yesterday, and where they organized macroparties that were desperate for the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on there will be an access control," the administrator said.
The okupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the multitudinary parties, which lasted up to two days and desperate the tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the estate made him unfair competition, as they sold the drinks to three euros, while at the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had had to respond to local noise complaints, while, as she pointed out, the inconvenience was not caused by the guests of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the okupada house and, above all, the attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The disco manager explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago she "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that during the last few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately evict the property in order to end the problems of coexistence and citizenship that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor in the occupied building, but over the last few months the okupas had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this regard, he added that "impunity must be ended and that it must be forceful against the incisor that has been generated on the estate."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 1530 hours the police went until 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in the heart of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed some promotional pasquins of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again located, in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these, it was until, in September, the town council convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for so many other access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors on the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city, is the theme of conversation between all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost already a recurring theme to give hands to when two members of this old chosen caste are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between the views of three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldan, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate "the mountain front," since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is possible to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it is very accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "says the architect for whom the title of" Collserola's doors "encloses a" lexic trap ": it is not necessary to think of them" as the access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where it is necessary to act. "
Mòdol, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."
Risks arising from the "uncertain that it is today to project public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and that in the area of the Forum he had "his song of the swan."
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders over where it can be built.
"To limit something is to set the next step," that is, its overstep.
"We have to think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters."
More closely to the question, Mòdol believes that, by simplifying, the Vallesan side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no," for a purely topographical question.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not fall into a broken sack," although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers to intervene in this project "from the very first moment."
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe way to allow the architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a whole success," he points out) that have to be created: "The architects should be just a tool."
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because at the bases of the contest a global view of Collserola is missing: "16 cross-sectional competitions have been convened," he says, in the sense of mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, that sees and understands the area as a whole. "
This means, at least where appropriate, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In his view, the City Council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in all its extension, for an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonah Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of arraigo, the legal constable of the Red Casino granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed for alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonah Larrazábal will be released after the legal seizure of the Red Casino gave him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Royale Casino, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonah allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the Regiomontano City Council to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Attorney & apos; s Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, and on 2 September he was arrested and uprooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State capital.
He remained there for 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued after the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with a million and a half pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was given an arrest warrant by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence was established to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the charge of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing the operation of it.
On Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the regio mayor; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the Public Prosecutor's Office, attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the members of the gambling house was the one who granted the forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to book the name.
On the basis of file 197 / 2011, legal forgiveness is granted to Jonah Larrazábal and no claim may be made in the course of the proceedings before him, in addition to the fact that he will not be required to make reparation for harm or punishment.
After the hearing of the legal owner of the betting house, about 15: 50, the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
It shall also notify it of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident where Governor Francisco Blake lost his life and seven more people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which Governor Francisco Blake Mora lost his life, and seven other people, indicate that the helicopter was directly hit on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot trying to make a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate for flying.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the land, the masks had contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so he had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that research in the impact area does not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In one search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented in a structural way.
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements to transport the passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation can last several months, it could even reach one year.
For its part, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff operated at cruise speed and that this happened on an ascending soft ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical normativity the flight was carried out under the rules of visual flight, this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
The reports at the SAICM placed conditions for take-off, as the aircraft moved towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, there were low-height nubosity layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that by the conditions of nubosity the crew will have sought an area of less elevation and greater visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft match, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and side path.
The pattern of dispersion of the aircraft & apos; s remains makes it possible to assume that the helicopter was hit on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the accident, there is still no evidence in the remains of the ship of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet over the average sea level, the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was expected to disarticulate along the course.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no dispersed parts of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Social Security leads research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetic protocol of obesity of childhood and adolescence', which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Speciality Hospital of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutriologists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research, the population is invited to participate whether or not it is right, to go to the sports units participating in the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to the minors, every Saturday from 8: 00.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since October 8, the activity has been carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (southern Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On November 14, he said that the goal was to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and heredophamiliary history of diseases, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or renal failure.
He noted that the Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure taking, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (it is intended to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight increase in children.
'Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 noted that in just six years there was an increase, for boys, of 77 per cent in obesity, and for girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed, 'said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the country's population differs from others because of its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of Indian American heritage, 30 percent European and 5 percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which allows to detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic and even prediabetes alterations.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, who are explained to each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarianism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and to use means of transport rather than walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the increased consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, burger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics discussed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of the environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the pavement were to be met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand pods each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who said that if the process of building and maintaining an asphaltic pavement is the right one, the pods could be reduced in quantity or even completely eliminated.
In its conference A technological opinion of the potholes, given in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge of it develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and therefore the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of which are high molecular weight, called asphalnos, and others of low molecular weight, called malnos, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphaltic folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compact.
Each of the little stones that constitute the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By passing the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphaltic folder, it abounded, is placed a last layer called a rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphaltic folder and provide friction on the way.
As the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphaltic folder.
When the ground is wet, the water is spread inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a smoothing of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only then the asphaltic folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be followed to the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, in order to avoid the formation of potholes frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already in the market and allow to repair potholes easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What was left of the Valley candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its number 14 title as a princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca is in the interest of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winning podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that credits her as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Miss Atlántico was raised with the crown and the scepter, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina, Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Medo (2000), Médito (2000), Aljor (2000), Aljor (2000).
Today the big question that many are asked is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain she was elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Leamos Literary Road.
The question was answered by the Vallecaucana:
"I read a lot, I think quite a lot in literature, I think it's a way of cultivating, I definitely think the book that marked me as childhood is" The Beginner, "it's a pretty deep book.
Today I read "Crime and Punishment," a book of universal literature that we all have to read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The ardor of Blood."
A response that was not very good first for the term "culturalizing" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books that you quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony, he said he felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Little Begin" is a great book. "
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favouritism.
A Togotan journalist suggested that being the favorite, ovation and candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best handmade suit, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and so did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in his first presentation in a swimsuit on the Hilton beach and his two parades in the coronation evening.
Although in both it looked certain, it was noted that it lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Como en caso" program, of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was appointed a princess "checks that the candidate who wins the most during the contest is not left as queen."
In addition, Valle was very elusive about the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for his defects in the meltdown and fibrosis that was noticed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the most healthy body, good food and responsible physical work.
The queens prepper Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there was the best, "but his problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, he dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the Vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that were performed.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
His body was never his strong, and here he was charged. "
For this award, which for the first time gives the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in a swimsuit, a cruel vaticino emerged last night, as it was said that this was the contentle that Raymundo granted Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Contest itself.
However, she will pass to history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was eluded by the crown.
So was the work of the Chaleño who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A Cali lofoscopist passed to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these staff members is key.
On November 4, a lofoscopist of the Cali STI went into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano," through the collation of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophosphopists working in the STI section, that week was the "availability" shift for Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to stay in the jungle for more than five days to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after the corresponding courses, he specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who directed the world's oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to carry Guillermo León Sáenz's decadacular card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, as it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the Farc.
In search of the print
For a dactiloscopista of the Sijín de Cali the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operative against "Cano," is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin of error, which can become key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of bodies, the lofoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false ballots or have no papers.
We take the fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, for in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint from the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different burglary," he recalled.
The prints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation found that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, he does place him at the crime scene.
A STI dactyloscopist explained that in the objects "the prints are removed with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplaner or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the STI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a print.
However, if it can be used, if the respective check is done.
The "outraged" challenge authorities in New York City
Hundreds of protesters were clinging to Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupa Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, under a court order, into Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and by trying to occupy another park in the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were clinging to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the "outraged" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we are going to set up somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ups and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupa Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the "indignant" response to the eviction from his camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the site and allowing the protesters to stay in camp.
In addition, the "outraged" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray was unable to confirm the specific figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization claims that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already moved to show support for the members of the movement and had tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned compound - is still closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this very Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this early morning should be analysed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed copies of this court order at this time and even handed them over to the officers who were guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes," Bray said, who reported that some officers beat the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting members of Occupa Wall Street or from applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or from allowing protesters to access the park again with shops or other properties they used previously."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the protesters, which he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to reinstall with tents and sleeping bags.
The regator personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law."
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to hurt other people," as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
"This morning's eviction was gross and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of the American workers," said the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "disrespecting freedom of expression."
The leaders of "Occupa Wall Street" also indicated that they plan to organize "great actions" by Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests last, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special TV Christmas
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," a lifeguard in "Baywatch," a bunny from "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive distribution on the Internet of a pornographic home video in which he appears together with his then husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
At the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a host in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married in Buenos Aires to the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of her concerts in New York City.
Japan reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the fall spiral that started in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent of the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo amounted to $300 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been reduced.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to move on, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at the annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the rebound of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas ravaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared with a 0.9 per cent decrease in capital expenditure from January to March, the first fall after six months of continuous increases.
However, the true repulsive of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites the use of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructure, to use the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has, above all, been awakened by the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Nippo currency - has become one of the "shelter values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the shady forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the yen's contribution.
While markets continue to be besieged by the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower its guard.
"We must be attentive to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member countries presented more clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the main powers are slowing down.
As it went down four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, when it was precipitated eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens refuel the doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the outlying risk premiums fired and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parquis, Greece continues to entangle the maze leading to the emergence of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the one-hundred-day period agreed upon in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date of February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said, opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the staff disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and he made it clear that he will not give his approval to any commitment letter of compliance with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, even though it had the impact of the order of the Papandreu referendum, had reiterated yesterday that its demand was firm: it would not unblock aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties did not sign "a written compromise without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay for the sixth tranche" of 8 billion, although there is no final date.
The Greek wood still has a long thread.
Mrs. Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-wide top in the role of microfinance."
Queen Doña Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor in the past two decades to this interchange of cooperation, whose "essence" stated that it lies in being a "tool for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being."
Yesterday the Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to the achievement of the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations on a horizon 2015, and "especially in the one that aims to halve the volume of people living on income below a daily dollar, setting the" poverty line. "
Spain "continues to work" to extend the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and takes on this task with" responsibility, "said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that come from the Summit, which will continue until Thursday," will ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women, "which are the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a forum for discussion, but also a platform for "two basic goals."
His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and 100 million of those households are expected to leave the poverty line they are in.
The momentum in the conception of micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path begun years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Dona Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition."
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link to this project was, yesterday, the "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor."
Finally, Queen Doña Sofía concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to make progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic gain, as it is a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez considered that micro-credits are "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty," and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work on criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation."
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded from those who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected by the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe had not initially been on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who believe that the government's policy is currently too unstrict with the Greeks and could be so in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The several-minute standing ovation that was won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe."
This could be manifested in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to enable the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face."
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble's idea.
It is certainly unlikely that the 27 will quickly reach agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would clearly strengthen Germany's weight.
Angry to calm the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But also, she has not tried to win at her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in passing.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are engaged in an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family allowances and to make a speech on the issue, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and the aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still reminds one of the axes of the presidential right-wing campaign, most want to focus on sick casualties.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private sector workers before they can take the drop.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' salary, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on staff members a day of unpaid deficiency in the event of a job loss (so far, they have no deficiency, compared with the three days that are applied in the private sector).
As these issues are discussed, the majority also put the issue of fraud on the table, this time oriented towards abuse of labour casualties.
"There will be a significant increase in controls and, in addition, if someone is found committing a fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand said, speaking at the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement seem to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of labour-loss fraud.
In fact, since 2002, this issue has been constantly monitored and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have normally borne fruit.
The French are only sick in the rest of Europe.
Let us look at national figures with attention, first of all.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than €237 million was paid in 2006 for labour loss benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, the drop subsidies accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46 per cent are for maternity and work-related casualties, while 54 per cent are related to sick leave, a figure of €6.2 billion.
As a result, 2.5% of the expenditure on health.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days of work leave, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that no doubt hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day's sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of the sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months, and 11% were longer.
If we compare them to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for both health and other reasons) in France ranged from 10 to 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant in comparison to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of sick leave over 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long," i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "properly adapted or unjustified; a total of 1.2 million was considered to be 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a negligible figure compared, for example, to work in black.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between €9 and 15 billion per year, that is, more than the total cost of low-income subsidies and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos stated on Monday, 14 November, before Parliament; he also added that the 100 days that have been given to his union government would not be sufficient to achieve that objective.
"To make efforts leading to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's stay in the euro area "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos has expected that the country's government deficit will be reduced "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit itself to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his "New Democracy" party.
He agreed with the objectives of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties' support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee states that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live by denying death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make provisions to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so that assisted suicide and euthanasia are allowed, when the patient considers that option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in tenth place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death."
With or without medication, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or of assisted suicide with non-competent persons or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday for teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practised, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practised, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, favourable to euthanasia
Let us remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66 per cent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
With regard to persons who have experienced assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a trial should not be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
Furthermore, among its recommendations, it is suggested in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls for the training of health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of the experts who sign the report as "extreme," inter alia, because euthanasia is not limited to the end-stage patients.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide," Deschamps said, who yesterday consulted a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
He added, however, that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she described as "a manifest in favour of euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bachar El Asad showed yesterday to the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bachar El Asad was intensified yesterday, which, with Russia's support, resists it and denounces that there is a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union has strengthened the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have been in favour of President Asad's abandonment of power.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bachar El Asad to "abandon power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime forces has already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with regard to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh position.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States welcomed the "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the" Syrian "regime.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking on an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to the repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime & apos; s forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during shelling and shooting with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Al Mualem, considered that the country "was moving towards the end of the crisis."
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend damasco from its functions, which in its view constitutes "a dangerous step."
Syria "will not fail," he added, ensuring that "the plot against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his view, is part of "paranoia."
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to take place tomorrow in Rabat to complete the implementation of the plan to exit the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, has yesterday judged the decision of the Arab League "incorrect," while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, although it did not support the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form their team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" to recover the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today he met with the trade unions and the employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a wide programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the designated Council.
For his part, the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has stated that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen ministers, of the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and of the obligationists yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its agenda, he said, adding that he is "sure that markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment by the President initially welcomed the markets, but then the concern was imposed, in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team mainly composed of technocrats, even if he has emphasized that he would like to include "politicians."
The new Government will have to function until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it considers.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will get a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti is committed to work, when he is in office, taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy "regaining its role" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for new measures of rigour.
The Italian "chief of the leaders" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on the matt, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy," according to the editorialists.
The great unknownite will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put some €200 billion in State obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIAA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The AIAA expressed last week its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on AIAA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and had participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamateurs" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company led him to contact, in 1995, the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine.
It is then believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, AIAA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as one Member State has informed the Agency, worked for most of its career in this technology in the military nuclear programme of its country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, during the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in the case of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent are due to racial differences and 20 per cent to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that these types of crimes and crimes have again increased," said the human rights organization Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long noted that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds a head of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must strive to put an end to such abuses," he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement of police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin colour, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The web site of microblogging Twitter changed on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" tab make it possible to follow more legitimately and live the activity of other "Twittos," that is, those netizens whose messages ("tweets") are still on the Internet or following you.
This allows us to know if they follow messages, if they are paid to new accounts, if they qualify any messages as their favorite, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, as the Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner has told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message from another person, followFriday pour remander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a a public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable to celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
On the network, users have discussed the interest of this innovation at a glance of "tweets" with different opinions.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it's too much like Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter flow," writes @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of a large social-democratic / democratic coalition in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary "gold rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus to avoid possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay 3 billion more in interest each year," said Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, by the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an Act with equivalent value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model," as Germany was the first European country to adopt this type of "rule."
By 2017, the structural government deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal State should not exceed 0.35% of GDP every year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020 / 2021 on the basis of the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens a new intervention of the exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Namibian authorities would again intervene the mark of change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we prove that there is excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was up to a level close to the historical peaks that led to the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Namibian currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually going back since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "shelter value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crises in Europe.
The dollar will be repaid on Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the 105 yen symbolic bar, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was listed at about 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Nippo currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of the revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them into the national currency.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Noda said, who fears that the rise of the yen will cut the weak recovery.
The third global economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in one year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of the households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases."
The Finance Minister, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures," suggesting that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the emission institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five billion yen (47 billion euros), bringing to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of the funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to inundate the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The guys grow up, the bags are slipping
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the most weakened countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European exchanges are a little further sinking into the negative area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and stood at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"Taking into account the new tensions regarding the lending returns of the most affected euro area States, stock markets around the world continue to be part of their recent profits."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional corridor at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market operators regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look at Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a limited range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushize Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The re-emergence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, for the option of a country in difficulty leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish types more than 6%
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the 10-year Italian obligations reached 6.85%, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of suffocating itself with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between the 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Pending growth figures in the euro area
From the statistical point of view, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a more favourable figure than the expected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stalemate.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if you look at the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that there are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic developments will mean the doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing shortage of fossil resources will have to be addressed in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, including the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case with Belgium, which has to do with the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor with Switzerland, which is only intended to build state-of-the-art plants.
On the other hand, the Czech Republic, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite some examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, reconstructing a plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a discourse.
The Berlin election will lead to an increase in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noted.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
The European champion in the wind sector, of which he gets 30% of his electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent of the wind; for this reason, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would undermine realism to the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not in principle express opposition to this type of energy, as the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost to building an industrial sector with 125,000 leading jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
It is widely export-oriented and covers a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets that can create non-offshoring jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would be the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of the EUR 6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would charge an EPR designed to run for 60 years when the manufacturer's collapse is planned?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as there is no diabolical source.
Areva's development of low-CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not cause consequences either for people or for the environment.
In Chernobil, the accident was due to the reactor design and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of an unprecedented range, which resulted in the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
As a result of this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the RPA presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is studied by all the electrical actors who want to build a plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized on the basis of various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figures policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "country of human rights."
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the Libération newspaper of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters."
However, it is rarely economically analysed.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million immigrant workers," while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande merely includes banalities, indicating that co-development will help to solve the "migration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be cost-effective in the electorate, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pressing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly engaged in professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country with a lack of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of the nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1 per cent increase in migration flows represents an increase in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9 per cent.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized US Nobel awards and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, with an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a 30-year-old immigrant in Germany will make a net contribution (income less expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets throughout his / her life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the missing growth points "with his teeth."
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember that, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, to Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, for democracy to triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know from Napoleon the "Little One," that it was a thought.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient in itself and can even become a "tool of oppression," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruence.
This ambivalence must be reflected in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines of the front of the democratic battle have now moved and, in many cases, the Republican soldiers are no longer making good progress.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a vacuum stop of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to have any impact, but a common exercise, of full rights, quiet and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is in line with the orders of the markets and rating agencies, that it is that which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is being humiliated on the international level.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for people's sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead to a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European integration.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The interest-motivated revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "no contact" chip are widespread
The world's chip card lounge starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in world sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of non-contact technology, which allows to pay for common transport or purchases by simply bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million cards with no contact chip will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Their share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and represent about 10% of the world's chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million free-of-contact Pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to make the top run, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically disseminating to their customers, bank cards equipped with the system without contact," says Gérard Nébouy, general director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for carrying out transactions.
"They're lagging behind."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We anticipate that 80 to 120 million units will be sold in 2012 around the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhone will be equipped with about 200 customers and collaborators with a case that allows for no contact payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algiers already "has certainty."
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing any further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two French in Niger last January would have resumed the walkways.
Raped in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, the French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The survey of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who long remained in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has enjoyed external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "support" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of Kamikazes or increasingly complex explosive devices and in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pushing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, long seen the group as a community of unworthy enlightened people.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), it incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is living a rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants are in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter focus first on churches, bars and administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations increased.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 were recorded dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and left its northern feudos.
The past Christmas, he claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of this kind.
In August, the United Nations headquarters became its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would range from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is a matter of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information."
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and Israel's aid, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A crisis-weakened America, can it manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican candidates for the presidential candidates, the electors might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have made more and more loud statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for the Republicans.
The slogans, often unsubstantiated, on China, Iran, are spreading aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race towards the "Grand Old Party," has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulation of their currency," a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated view of foreign policy, is almost choked by an attitude that "upsets" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stalled in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Reagan style.
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I get elected, I'll stop Iran," he baffled.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed to fulfil his obligations to that partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second most well-qualified candidate, shows a shameful lack of knowledge of these issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "tries to develop nuclear capacity," apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, for his part, he is willing to deploy the U.S. army to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and they label it as weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The people judge in a rather positive way Obama's national security balance, which killed Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrust the military interventions that lead to a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resuscitate its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must provide gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that directly communicates, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Similarly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year through a first had 1,224 km that communicate the region of St. Petersburg with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012, which will provide a total of 5 billion cubic metres of gas, that is, sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents the atmosphere of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the land course by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
At once, these two countries lose something of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact," referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But price is a weakening of the energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to succeed in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," said François Fillon at the opening of the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the large contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom's managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against the anchors of the ships.
It is based at the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, out of caution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream society.
It was also necessary to strengthen measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in the waters of Sweden, but the project leaders gave up on the view that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to establish itself permanently at sea off the coast.
"In case of a failure, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, gas from the pipeline shall therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that there will be a leak, as they have planned reunions that are expected to have a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by means of a submarine robot, carried over by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one metre, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repair.
The flow of the gas is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
The German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each), joined it.
These five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and exploit the pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to the company, for a period of 25 years renewable, all the gas transport capabilities.
"Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenditure.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas output door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its white broken leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a book of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant to the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquettes.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode.
And he made it.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first few years has remained far away, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, as the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginning, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists expose their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard tapas on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in the fall of 2006, Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled people are seeking employment.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled doubled the average rate: 19 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disheartening?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, general director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, much remains to be done."
It should be mentioned that disabled unemployed people continue to face many obstacles to access to employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed high school and, out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In other words, there are many issues that are particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that "are the key to the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of people advances, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the Association IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge about low disabilities," with "excessive representation of wheelchair, physical or intellectual poor."
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, general director of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution," as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, particularly among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their staff, compared with 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party gives them.
We will not dare say that there was a sense of connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stand of the Stade of France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker's grudge against Turkey, the Belgian selector has only praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says Lille's front.
As for the contrast between your presentations on your team and in the selection, "is a set," it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to stand."
Convened to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this game against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine."
Without forgetting "pleasure."
He has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
This will, of course, particularly strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We just got up against each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
In a simple way, Leekens has made reference to "pride."
"Pride" for "a gala match."
"Pride" also to see, as "neighbor," that France "is again a very high-level team," about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be happy to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We are building something; the players are ambitious, they are hungry.
"You can see it in the next parties." Including the party against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento faces with great optimism the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the one-way game, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes go by, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selecçao, which he has been leading since September 2010, will be qualified for the 2012 Eurocup.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a party to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the one-way game (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that would have given it peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, as we haven't marked out of the house."
But at home, in the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, to a public that should be just as excited, even if it is clear that the party "is very equal," I say an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to participate in the 2012 Eurocup," the successor of Carlos Queiroz has, however, relativized.
The tie of Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, although they also need to mark.
"It is a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, as we have not marked out of the house," Bento regrets.
"We are going to play against a team that has a high technical quality and has players with a high individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning so as to "not allow them time to think."
A good idea, as long as this time, it's realistic.
