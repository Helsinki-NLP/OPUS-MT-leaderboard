Accrued incidence of rapid increase in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly moving forward in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causing agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2.
Since then, the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most people recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is moving towards a more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union country or the European Economic Area (EU / EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in Hubei province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA and EU countries with that in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world now follow that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU / EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on 24 January 2020 in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been identified in the 30 EU / EEA / UK (UK) countries, according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the reported COVID-19 case counts in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8: 00 a.m.
These data were used to examine trends in COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the UK and to compare them with that in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU / EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020, at 8: 00 a.m., compared to that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU / EEA and EU countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days in EU / EEA countries and the UK, in general, followed that in Hubei province, China (figure 1).
In the EU / EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly about 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU / EEA and UK countries showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 similar (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA countries and the UK, compared to that in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that, as at 15 March at 8: 00 a.m., 15 other EU / EEA and UK countries had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases of COVID-19 reported is rapidly increasing in the EU / EEA and the UK.
The trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is in spite of different stages in countries, variations in national public health responses and, possibly, different case definitions in countries and different protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 case admissions in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU / EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
A study in 2010-11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds every 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-11).
Model scenarios in relation to the saturation of health care capacity, with calculations for each EU / EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk > 90% of overcapacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since, so far, case conglomerates have been formed in certain regions of EU / EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Statistical Territorial Unit Nomenclature 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is making rapid progress in the EU / EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as that in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of ECDC, it is essential to take a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response in a manner that is appropriate if it is not implemented in advance.
Rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU / EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2, has so far led to the death of 3000 people and has infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, leading to a human catastrophe.
Similar to its homologous virus, the SARS-CoV, which caused the SARS in thousands of people in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the subject of research, which is developing rapidly.
We will deal with the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still have no answer, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Feast of January 25, 2020 has become an unheard of and unbeatable memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home for the whole holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to almost 50 more countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the progress made in research on this new subject that is developing rapidly.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a VOC, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some critical questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronavirus have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have met twice with highly pathogenic coronavirus in humans, that is, the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third by coronavirus that is recorded in the history of humanity.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, conglomerates of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019 by Wuhan.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the site of the infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 more countries from all over the world (fig. (fig. 2) .2).
Since the situation is evolving rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https: / / mp.weixin.qqq.com / s / UlBi-HX _ rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7 per cent) of the infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31 / 100,000) more than women (0.27 / 100,000).
COVID-19 expanded in conglomerates mostly in and around Hubei.
On average, there were 5 days (2 to 9) between the appearance and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus are a subfamily of large, wrapped viruses that contain a unique-sense chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, range and delta, of which alfacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those that infect humans.
The espiona (S) glycoprotein of the wrapper is bound to its cell receptors, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then the fusion of membranes is produced.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the glycoproteins of the wrapper and the proteins of the nucleocapside, forms vesicles containing virions, which are then merged with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
The SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to the SARS-CoV than to the MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, particles of the SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by the orf3b and a secret protein encoded by the orf8.
The orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the electronic cryomicroscopy structure of the human ACE2 of full length in resolution 2.9, in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can unite two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate guest
It is known that the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through the civettes and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, the bat was considered to be the native host of the SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two coronavirus similar to the SARS of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the transmission route remains elusive.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the bats virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within the protein S.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that the pangolins (long-footed mammals that feed on ants and that are usually used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in the pangolines and the SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference spread by the whole of two genomes remains a great difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. (fig. 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 ° C with a moisture of 40-50%.
The SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 ° C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in disabling the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
As a result, we can only use previous studies with other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4) .4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate host immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including C-type lectina receptors, Toll type receptors (TLR), NOD type receptors (NLR) and RIG-I type receptors (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophageal phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of the SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including T-cells CD4 + and CD8 +, play an important role in defense.
CD4 + T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8 + T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Co-operative T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help defence cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit the functions of T-cells by inducing apoptosis of T-cells
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies of a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and at worst, multiorganic failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by conglomerates, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large amount of virus or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adapt the quarantine time effective according to the most accurate incubation period; this way, asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should quarantine extend to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by any other symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnoea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after the disease occurred.
In serious cases, patients were rapidly evolving to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 indicated that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
In a comparable way, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the higher mortality of the MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), dyspnoea (40% -42%), diarrhoea (20% -25%) and throat pain (13% -25%) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was needed in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By February 14, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2 per cent when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, the SARS mortality rate for November 2002 was 10 per cent in 8096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37 per cent in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, the R0 of the SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be high and was raised to 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 95% from 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of the SARS-CoV ranged only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
It is therefore much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, as a cruise.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients within two weeks of the occurrence.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital can re-enter the virus, an alarm signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of < 4 × 109 / l, including a lymphocyte count of < 1 × 109 / l, and high aspartate aminotransferase levels in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrotic sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer level, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, was high, and the lymphocyte count was gradually reduced.
Abnormal chest x-rays are detected in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or bilateral emerylated glass opacities in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ADHD).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes reduces the surfactant level and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in chest X-rays are often in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the descamation of the pneumocytes, the formation of a hyaline membrane and the infiltration of lymphocytes into the interstice, and multifluorinated syncitial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral and SDRA infection, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of RNA of SARS-CoV-2 by a chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
A combination of a history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is therefore essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect the SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA at between 20 × 10-18 mol / l and 200 × 10-18 mol / l (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a graduated rod in less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
With luck, the new technique can dramatically increase the sensitivity and convenience if checked in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide support care to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2) .2).
These therapies include treatments currently in use or potential for antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as those of the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Respiratory assistance is therefore critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenotherapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need assistance from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OECs), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory deficiencies.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals that are the main cause of the SDRA and the multiorganic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 anticlonal monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include the modulation of the immune response directed by T-cells; the blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a cytokine signalling route 4 suppressor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids has been recommended for a short period for patients with critical COVID-19.
The efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed at the time of this analysis.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19 has been tested.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with monocatenary RNA, such as MERS and SARS.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir / ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir / ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
The extraction of blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not get the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
On this basis, plasma was removed from the blood from a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and 10 seriously ill patients were injected.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which may cause fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
It is therefore more important and practical to isolate the B cells from the recovered patients and to identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend to a large extent on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the theories of the MCT.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or imprecise, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific COVID-19 therapy, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from serious stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, which used MCT in only about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the amount and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western medicine (MO) only to the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the times needed for body temperature recovery, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO + MCT group than in the MO group alone.
More surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO + MCT group than in the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO + MCT group than in the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of MCT are still awaiting more well-controlled trials at higher scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of the actions and determine the effective components of the MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with COVID-19 suspicion or confirmation are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, solitude and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
The tracking of mandatory contacts and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty for the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19, to persons with suspicion and persons in contact with them, and to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to stop the transmission chain of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible guests, and they often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and powerful neutralizing antibodies or immunity to protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live attenuated viruses have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these possible vaccines in older people and lethal stimulation models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection should still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that the SARS was extinguished 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since.
On the other hand, there are still cases and conglomerates of SRES sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for the MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronavirus.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a prognosis model for the disease is essential to enable health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (table (table 33)):
Age: age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 years and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care most likely had underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably greater than those who did not (with an average age of 66 compared to 51), suggesting that age is a prognosis factor for the evolution of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care most likely suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfered with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of reactive protein C (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the RCP level and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the patient's evolution.
These enzymes are expressed intensively in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
They are therefore traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide long-term psychotherapy and support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal life.
According to the demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from those of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower airways, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper airways and causes mild or no symptoms at the early stage of the infection, as is the case with other coronavirus that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at an early stage or during incubation can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while the transmission was mostly not at the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be completed by March and the downward phase will last 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., considered that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to influenza.
However, there have been promising signs in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been managed.
Like the SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually extinguish or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (fig. (fig. 55)).
The SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through the cough or sneeze, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the faeces, which poses a new possibility of faecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41 per cent of cases were possibly caused by nosocomia infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 medical care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 respirator (serial number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent a potentially infected person's drip of fluid from being transmitted through the air or attached to the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 masks (serial number 1860) can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virions can penetrate them completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serial number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical care providers should wear custom-made insulation robes in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite using a N95 mask; the virus may have entered your body through your swollen eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear protective masks or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash hands with disinfecting soaps more often than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered to be an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with the SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great alert in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only on 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassure the citizens that the new virus had a low contagious and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message significantly relaxed the public alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Feast, and the critical moment was missed to contain the disease on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and make decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, as each word matters to citizens and can make them change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at its early stage, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the system of society's response regularly.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 more countries from all over the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has generated the sense of reappearance of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and gravity and mortality are also greater for older people than for young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why the SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than the SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can give positive in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between the SARS-CoV-2 and two coronavirus of bats similar to the SARS, it is not yet possible to conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the responses to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can resurgence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while it is transmitted among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, become extinct as the SARS, or will it re-emerge regularly as the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these questions and many others.
However, no matter what it takes, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of the coronavirus and its guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronavirus were known to cause mild diseases, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 put the coronavirus in the focus again and surprised us with a high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother, the SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and we would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus.
Most human coronavirus have its origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
Also known are the guests of intermediate reservoir of some human coronavirus.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Research into the interactions between coronavirus and animal guests could also provide important information about the pathogeny of coronavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronavirus, with emphasis on the history of its discovery, as well as its zoonotic origins and the transmission between species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different human coronavirus from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is analysed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of positive monocatenary RNA viruses with wrapping.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, because of the crown form they have under an electronic microscope.
As for their structure, coronavirus have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyproteins replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 ~ 16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including espionage (S), wrapping (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific accessory proteins for each line are also encoded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronavirus are classified into four genera (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus of beta-coronavirus contains the majority of human coronavirus and is subdivided into four lineage (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes of most alfacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronavirus have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alfacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ADHD) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most devastating in today's history and infected more than 8000 people, with a crude lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic on the Arabian peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later called SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing coronary artery disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91 000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronavirus have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronavirus in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogenic, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the driving force and the factors of restriction of the leap between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and the intermediate and amplifying animal guests of the SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for the prevention of the spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of zoonotic origins, species-to-species transmission and human coronavirus pathogenicity.
In particular, we highlight and analyse the common theme that the parent viruses of human coronavirus are not usually pathogens in their natural reservoir guests, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examine the trend of evolution of human coronavirus, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also analysed in this context.
The coronavirus of animals has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of the HCoV-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronavirus had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronavirus have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of common cold, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10 ~ 20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and the subsequent serious pass in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, the symptoms of which are identical to those of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
Both the HCoV-229E and the HCoV-OC43 are distributed throughout the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a severe lower airway infection.
The SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is the SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases of 774 deaths and spread over many countries and continents.
Apart from the superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough, and shortness of breath as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, altered liver function and high creatine kinase level are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients later require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower airways, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, can also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunosuppressive patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a family member of the initial patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronavirus.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was found to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchyolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchyolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchyolitis acquired in the community, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four community-acquired human coronavirus have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although there were accidents from unknown causes, as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to have caused serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these human coronavirus acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are from the Middle East, there have been cases imported with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of the MERS are similar to those of the SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among the diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases confirmed in the laboratory were recorded, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making the MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to be.
From mid-December 2019, conglomerates of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of infection of the lower airways caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and, in addition, called COVID-19 disease.
As at 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude lethality of 3.4 per cent.
Notably, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which occurs as fever, cough and dyspnoea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve to acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although the SARS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotid sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread around the world.
By comparing and contrasting the SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronavirus, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the human coronavirus disease course are very similar.
In this regard, the SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronavirus.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronavirus acquired in the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most frequently observed in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is a little lower.
Third, the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns that are characteristic of both the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community and the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to verify whether the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passes between humans, as is the case with the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
If the faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be diluted in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether the SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human passes, will have an influence on the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four human coronavirus acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronavirus that causes serious human and human diseases that developed serious human coronavirus diseases has been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronavirus must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counter the host's restriction factors.
In this sense, the more time the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infect, the more likely it will be to fully adapt to humans.
If well adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired coronavirus have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV and the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission among humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human objectives, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifying guests.
The SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronavirus acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than the coronavirus of humans acquired in the community and less pathogenic than the SARS-CoV or the MERS-CoV.
It remains to see if it will be fully adapted to humans and will circulate among humans without an animal reservoir or intermediate host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronavirus, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutive, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplifiers of human coronavirus guests.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it houses a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir guest houses a long-term and continuous human coronavirus.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of human coronavirus or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of the infection in humans and perform the function of host amplifier by allowing the virus to be replicated temporarily and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of the infection in humans.
A human coronavirus may cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronavirus can also be adapted to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reservoir guest.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had had contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Civettes of masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all the civetas in the markets.
However, it was reported that the coves of the wild masked palm trees or of unexposed farms to the living animal markets were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the coves of the masked palm trees would only act as an intermediate amplifier host, but not as a natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as intermediate amplifying guests of the SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
They all seem to be terminal guests of the SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of the SARS-CoV revealed a closely related coronavirus of bats, known as the Rhinolophus Bat CoV HKU3 related to the SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bats coronavirus share a 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with the SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats house emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that the WIV1 obtained from a faecal sample of bats uses the ACE2 of bats, civettes and humans as a receptor to enter the cells.
Amazingly, the sera of patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of the SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of the SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of the SARS-CoV.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the Bat CoV-HKU4 and the Bat CoV-HKU5.
The Bat CoV-HKU4 and the MERS-CoV use the same host receiver, the dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
The RNA-dependent polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV filogenetically approach their identified bats beta-acoronavirus counterparts in Europe and Africa.
So far, no MERS-CoV can be found alive in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the Bat CoV-HKU25, share a 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in BERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies specifically, as have camels originating from the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, which supports even more that camels act as guests of the Bona Fide reservoir of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in camels infected for MERS-CoV research.
Notably, the infected camels spread the viruses not only by respiratory means, but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main way of spreading bats virus.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of camel contact prior to the appearance of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species hosting the MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bats coronavirus, RTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir guests of the SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future coronavirus of bats practically identical.
Presumably, the intermediate animal guests of the SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals in danger, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral beta-acoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangolin coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92% with the SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RATG13, with an identity of about 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two virus sublinages similar to the SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to the SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In marked contrast, the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 and the RATG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
An earlier study in sick pangolines also reported the detection of viral contigoes in lung samples, which are also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence that comprised about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of the Pangolin being one of the intermediate animal guests of the SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in the Pangolin of the SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between the SARS-CoV-2 and the Pangolin Betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between the SARS-CoV-2 and the RATG13 is even lower than that between the SARS-CoV-2 and the Pangoline beta-acoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals should still be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBD between the SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin, the beta-acoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 and the RATG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBD of the Pangolin-related beta-acoronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-proposal defends a recombination between the Pangolin beta-acoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2 and the RATG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is extended among beta-coronavirus.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronavirus, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bats coronavirus, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a coronavirus of bats called ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalachian mountains) detected in a tricolor bat in North America had a close relationship with the HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bats coronavirus, called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camellids have also been suspected as intermediate guests.
For greater clarity, the knowledge of the animal origins of known human coronavirus so far is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events of human coronavirus transmission between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of transmission between species of HCoV-229E is not known with such precision.
Alfacoronavirus of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them is an alfacoronavirus of alpaca.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the bats virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpaca, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Secondly, the bats alfacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alfacoronavirus caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alfacoronavirus of alpaca has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible to rule out the possibility of the alpacas acquiring the alfacoronavirus related to the HCoV-229E of humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while bats alfacoronavirus act as a genetic acquis of the HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate guests who transmit the viruses to humans, particularly in the case of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats contribute, with a large pool of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the great ability to fly, are all favourable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator."
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate guest to being a stable and natural reservoir guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of the MERS-CoV, as the transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, Pangolin beta-coronavirus are highly pathogenic in Pangolines.
They may be a terminal host of the beta-acoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2, as are the civettes in the case of the SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for transmission between SARS-CoV-2 species from animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a virus related to the SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to the SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through the killing or mining of coal.
Second, the pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which a virus related to the SARS-CoV-2 had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the killing and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of the SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronavirus to cross the barriers of species.
First, its relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the coronavirus could be considered "moderate" to "high," with an average replacement rate of ~ 10-4 replacements per year, per site 2, depending on the stage of the coronavirus adaptation to new guests.
Coronavirus have a reading test exorribonuclease, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inaccessibility.
Interestingly, it is known that the nucleotydic analogue remdesivir suppresses the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of mutation of the coronavirus are about a million times higher than those of its guests.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the coronavirus is not well adapted to the host.
Compared to the SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be hoped that it has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Second, the long RNA genome of the coronavirus exerts additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination, and thus increases the probability of coevolution between species, leading to the emergence of new coronavirus when the appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by unique, copious open reading frameworks and the functions of protein encoded towards the 3 'direction of the genome.
Third, coronavirus change randomly and often of templates during RNA replication by a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In a host acting as a mixing vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during the transcription of RNA from the coronavirus.
Full-length RNA and highly counterpart subgenomics could be recombinated to generate new coronavirus.
Filogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronavirus, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of the SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in transmission events between species.
Based on the comparative analysis of human and civette isolated SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV experiences rapid adaptation in different guests, in particular with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
In general, the S-protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is intensively selected by the host antibody response.
In the SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its correctors for viral entry.
The RBD of the SARS-CoV is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including the bat, civeta, mouse and raccoon dog, which allows transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and civette viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are in the reason for binding to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Covette SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that the SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with the SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein implies that the binding affinity of S protein to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study points to the 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this binding compared to human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other corrector may be necessary for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans, after transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronavirus is also determined by other factors of dependency and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir guests of human coronavirus, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronavirus should usurp the host's dependence factors and subvert the host's restriction factors to make the transmission between species successful.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction should still be identified and characterized.
An objective research of complete genome of the host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could be useful.
Appearance of new human coronavirus: starting from scratch
The diversity of bats coronavirus offers numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronavirus.
In this sense, bats coronavirus act as the genetic acquis of human coronavirus.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronavirus and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoding genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the ancillary proteins of the SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered important in human adaptation, as Bats virus related to the SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was determined that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A elimination of 29 nucleotides characteristic of SARS-CoV was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes guest change.
In addition, the SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gamma-moronavirus linages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombinations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered from recombination events between different lineage, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other human coronavirus, in which human coronavirus recombinates with other animal coronavirus in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely results from the release of viruses from selection pressures, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to a elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 could be observed in bats and camels virus related to HCoV-229E, alfacoronavirus of alpaca has an insertion of a single nucleotide, which causes a change of frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronavirus is also driven by the selection pressure in its reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating the mutual adaptation between the coronavirus and bats.
The bats are apparently well adapted to the anatomical and physiologically coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the natural killer cell inhibitory receptor NKG2 / CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the elevated metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of coronavirus and affect the reading check of exorribonuclease, which provides the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus cepas could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for guest adaptation.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new human coronavirus have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronavirus are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir guests, such as bats and camels.
They are strongly replicated without causing a strong immune response from the host.
In this there are the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and to the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of untying the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The response of interferon is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflamasome in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammatory with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV.
Although a bats beta-acoronavirus has been found that shares a 95% nucleotide homology with the SARS-CoV, there is also a bats coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with the SARS-CoV-2.
Although civetas and other animals on the markets have been found to host viruses identical to the SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate guests of the SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-acoronavirus has been found to be significantly similar to the SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the Pangolins could act as one of the intermediate guests or that Pangolin beta-acoronavirus could bring fragments of genes to the final version of the SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronavirus have regained prominence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronavirus in human transmission.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in markets, close wet markets and kill the civets in them could have been effective in stopping the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, the pangolines should be removed from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lines of beta-acoronavirus of pangolines closely related to the SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how the SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through the pangolines and other mammals, it remains to be elucidated in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in China with the wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronavirus are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronavirus with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great possibilities for these zoonotic coronavirus to evolve and recombinate, which would lead to the emergence of new coronavirus that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that favour the spread of viruses, the opportunities for humans to contact bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the coronavirus and its natural guests, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep humans away from ecological niches from natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
There are still several pieces missing in the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus from SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze in what circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it's expected that the SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continuous research in this area will dilute the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and is a good reference to fight this pandemic worldwide.
However, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as the Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guideline that was posted online at Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., they presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support his important work and express our appreciation.
However, your work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the study) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), in order to confirm a suspicious case, it is necessary to combine any point of the epidemiological background characteristics with two points of the clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis, or three points of the clinical manifestations should be met if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 2 days (in the case of the case of the last 2 days, or in the case of a case of a case of a case of a small contact with a school class, etc.), such as in the last 2, in the case of a history of a case of a case of a case of a case of a case of a case of a patient (2).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing a normal lymphocyte count, decreased or reduced at the early start stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some characteristic of pathogenic or serological tests as follows: (1) positive for the specific IgM antibody and the specific IgG antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; (2) sequencing of the complete viral genome that shows a high homogeneity to the recognized new coronavirus; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and the specific IgG antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 in a specific serum test; or a change of the specific IgG antibody against the specific SARS-2 antibody against the acute phase, or in a positive phase of recovery of ≥ 4 times to ≥ 2.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood or airway samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The pathogen detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us that we should be careful with asymptomatic and symptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. flow diagram should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The score system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case," we recommend to seek and comply with the latest guidelines from their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the largest in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 yesterday in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were being left in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news medium, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being served in Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until this next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially started on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first reported cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, two men returned from Italy and one of them's women.
As at 19 March, these three had already recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea stated, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1 051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the 24 hours before 10: 00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 000 cases of coronavirus were reported, associated with at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Across the world, countries announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to receive their wages without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities La Meca and Medina throughout the day; previously, curfews were only held between 3: 00 p.m. and 6: 00 a.m..
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10: 00 p.m. and 4: 00 a.m..
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay at home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower the limits of toilet paper by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase limits of toilet paper to two and a transaction package in all the country's supermarkets, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly being supplied for fear of COVID-19 in the event that people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworks also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the four-pack restriction, "many supermarkets still deplete the product within one hour of delivery," and said the demand "had no precedent," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected."
Sales went up with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworks spokesman.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from the suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special Wednesday offer planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but the local council's restrictions on the timing of truck deliveries make it difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs as suppliers seek to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer on Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a voluminous article, which causes a low amount of stock in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a wide empty space on the shelves, which intensifies the sense of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there was an abundant amount of the article in the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy] and there would be large amounts, panic would probably be minimized, said Russell Zimmerman for ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that they exhausted the stocks.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property vendors offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were made because the buyers had free time on the long weekend of the Worker's Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page frame designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of the Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to the extent of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebeyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very concerned, both at the alarming levels of spread and gravity, and at the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "in addition to influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the appearance to the continuous global spread."
Ghebeyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
"And we've never seen a pandemic before that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic status arises following the decision of WHO in January to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
The director of the United States National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it will get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronary avirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case mortality rate was estimated at 4 per cent in China, while the global rate was between 13.04 per cent in Algeria and 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Frequent symptoms include fever, cough, and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptoms, usually, is about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping away from other people and controlling and self-isolating people who suspect that they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarters, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic disturbance, the postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-motivated purchases.
Schools and universities closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world & apos; s student population.
Misinformation about the virus was disseminated on the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of Eastern and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Due to the reduction in travel and the closure of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases, for the most part, were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, therefore, it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the coronavirus of the bats, the coronavirus of the pangolines and the SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was found that the first person who was known to have expressed symptoms was ill on 1 December 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last group of the wet market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, one case that was going back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old from Hubei province, could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with lighter symptoms.
As at 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the United Kingdom's lead scientific adviser, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases relate to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19, and who obtained a positive result confirmed according to the official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had conducted tests in more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries have had official policies of not conducting tests on persons with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79 per cent of the reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the amounts of infections in Italy were considerably higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most frequent being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were among people over the age of 60, and 75 per cent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to the dead persons who were positive in the COVID test, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died without the test may not be included, for example, in their homes, in elderly homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the amount of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of COVID deaths at a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is an understatement," a statement corroborated by anecdotal reports of subcounting in the United States. This understatement is common in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As at 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. A number of indicators are generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time that has elapsed since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global proportion of deaths in cases is 6.0 per cent (97,039 / 1,617,204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the case mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from a disease, and the rate of infection mortality, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a specified time frame and consider a specific population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the rate of lethality from pandemic infections in its entirety is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the case mortality rate.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on location.
Maciej Boni from Pennsylvania State University indicated, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilise and then begin to decrease when the disease runs out of available guests.
But, right now, it's almost impossible to make some reasonable foresight of when that will happen. "
The main medical adviser to the Government of China, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could end in June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that the SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more) is available."
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is so easily transmitted, will disappear completely" and "could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year."
The virulence of the reappearance would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in the respiratory tract (phlem), loss of sense of smell, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptosis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or persistent pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and bluish color in the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended in the event of these symptoms. Increased progress of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory difficulty syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not presenting clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, therefore the researchers advised to closely monitor and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44 per cent.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; more often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through the small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when coughing without covering the mouth, the droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. Respiratory droplets may also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although the virus is usually not transmitted by the air.
The droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people close to them or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR), can cause the aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore aerial spread.
It can also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through the faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may be possible before the symptoms are manifested and at more advanced stages of the disease.
People achieved positive results in disease tests up to three days before symptoms occurred, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only some reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by laboratory, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, while the ease with which the disease spreads is not fully clear, usually one person infects another two or three. The virus survives from hours to days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests for pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the UK authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that may have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronavirus related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective wrapper. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (B-line) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the level of the complete genome, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between the Pangolin viruses and those of humans.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the Pangolin coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to show that the Pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although, ultimately, it is confirmed through the chain reaction of polymerase with inverse transcriptase (RRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography images.
According to a study in Wuhan in which the chain reaction of polymerase was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the chain reaction of polymerase, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended "not to use computed tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19."
The WHO has published several RNA test protocols for the SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in blood or respiratory samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal hisopus, although a thigh hisopo can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be sufficiently precise for their widespread use to be approved.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features of the X-rays and CT images of symptomatic people include opacities in asymmetric peripheral flare glass and absent pleural spills.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis of unconfirmed images by polymerase chain reaction has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study in China compared the results of chest CT scan with those of polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although the diagnosis of images is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neuronal networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in the images, both with x-rays and with computed tomographs.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have restricted or disadvised all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health care providers who attend to someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement to demand limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the COVID-19 test. They are circulating wrong ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal lavage and mouthwash gargarages are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop one.
The washing of hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating and after ringing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60% alcohol in volume when water and soap are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0,1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7,5% iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or day care centre, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs that have been used by the sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or a disposable handkerchief for coughing or sneezing, and that they discard the handkerchief immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance of the respiratory droplets that disperse when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection without adequate hand hygiene." The use of masks in people who care for someone who may have the disease has also been recommended.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, but also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage public use of masks.
In the United States, CDC recommend using non-medical masks made from fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Thai health officials recommend that people make cloth masks in their homes and wash them on a daily basis.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited the use of a mask or the cover of the nose and mouth in public spaces.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask as they are in public spaces to be able to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured 10 million masks per day since mid-March, on 1 April required the use of masks by passengers on interurban trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outside, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks for those who cannot buy them.
The masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes measures to control the infection designed to stop the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarters, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can implement social distance methods by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact and physically distancing themselves from other people.
Many Governments now demand or recommend social alienation in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by government agencies and health organizations in the United States was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public meetings of more than two people. Older people and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at greater risk of suffering from serious diseases and complications, and the CDC recommend that they stay at home as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance," to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social alienation" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt a complete social isolation rather than encourage them to keep in touch with other people through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations that you only have sex with a person with whom you become, that you do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of having been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on appropriate self-isolation, and many Governments have required or recommended the self-quarantine of entire populations in the affected areas.
The stricter self-quarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission are recommended to do self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to stop the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be adopted at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease means trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distance, such as school closure and cancellation of events of mass concurrence; community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures and surface cleaning. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its gravity was evident, for example, the implementation of quarters in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also took a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented massive detection assessments and localized quarters, and issued alerts on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for health care by two thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Disposal may be preferred, but it should be maintained for the whole time that the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), as otherwise the transmission is quickly reactivated when measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicines approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing the existing medicines.
Taking over-the-counter medicines for cold, drinking liquids and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygenotherapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key response to the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for resource redistribution at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, cancelling optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating positive patients at COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case may have originated (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mainly linked to the Huanan wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed for which Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS."
The police admonished eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to the Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and a major railway crossing point.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that, as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States has outperformed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarters (known as orders to stay at home, shelter orders at the place or confinement) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are serving some kind of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1300 million people are confined in India.
As of March 26, 1700 million people worldwide were in some form of confinement, which increased to 2600 million people two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and her hospital informed the CDC of Jianghan of Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned the doctors in Wuhan for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially stated that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between humans.
In late January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "people's war," to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in the history of humanity," a health cord was announced on January 23 that prohibited travel inside and outside Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was later built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Feast holiday.
Universities and schools throughout the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote working measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was changed and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor exits. After the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, only one case had been transmitted nationally in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveller who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted nationally was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were made more flexible in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, two months after confinement was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the entry of visa or residence permit carriers would be suspended from 28 March, with no specific details as to when this policy will be completed.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese Government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for signatures. The State Council declared a day of mourning that will begin with a time of national silence of three minutes on 4 April at 10: 00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online to meet the physical distance in order to avoid the reoutbreak of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji's devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or about 13 per cent reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The hours of the airlines were also affected, and therefore modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best organized program to test for the virus in the population and isolate the infected, as well as identify and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived people from other countries through a mobile application, drive-thru centres to perform virus detection tests with results available the following day and increased diagnostic capacity to be able to test up to 20,000 people every day.
The South Korean programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not taking quarantine in entire cities. South Korean society was initially polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the dismissal of Moon for what they considered to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to praise their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases on a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, from 1 April, all newly arrived persons from outside must remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance in virus testing from 121 different countries.
On February 19, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran allocated five billion rials to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantine.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Year's Persian Nowruz continued.
The Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a center for the spread of the virus after China.
Amid the allegations of a cover-up of the scale of the outbreak in Iran, more than 10 countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the scale of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March, 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As at 17 March, at least 12 former Iranian politicians or politicians had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every 10 minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times more reported cases in Iran.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the relief of economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists were positive in the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
The cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was identified, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree to contain the outbreak, including quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
The Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of work activities and sports events in these areas has already been ordered. "On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy was 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including Series A football games, were to be held in closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sports events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reanimation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations for medical ethics on the triage protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China as the country with the largest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 deaths from the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy's combination of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high rate of mortality.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any social or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government was criticized for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he disadvised social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes where possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure facilities, such as bars and gymnastics, and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social distance measures, which prohibited the meetings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those deemed strictly necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersion of meetings.
Most of the companies were ordered to close, with the exception of those considered "essential," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the main public health institute of the United States Government, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in the conduct of tests, which hid the true magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
The conduct of tests was tarnished by the defective test kits produced by the Federal Government in February, the lack of approval by the Federal Government of the non-governmental test kits (of academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (a medical order was then required).
As at 27 February, the Washington Post reported that less than 4000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As at 13 March, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, Associated Press reported: "Many people with symptoms and a medical order have waited hours or days for a test."

On March 25, the governor said that the social distance seemed to be working, as the estimates of the duplication of cases increased from 2 days to 4.7 days.
As at 28 March, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people had died from the virus. On 26 March, it was reported that the United States had more confirmed coronavirus infections than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As at 8 April, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States and 12,841 people had died.

The general approval of Trump's crisis management has been polarized between the party lines.
US officials and commentators criticized the US's dependence on the import of critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of travel patterns was used to identify and predict propagation patterns and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.

In early March, the Government of India began to evacuate its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the Government of South Africa repatriated 112 South African citizens.
Medical tests were carried out prior to take-off, and four South Africans with signs of coronavirus had to stay to mitigate the risk.
Only the South Africans who gave negative tests were repatriated.
The results of the test authorized all South Africans, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, who, as a preventive measure, remained in observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days in The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.

On the other hand, China's aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the control and containment of the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided regular updates to avoid panic at the Lunar New Year holidays."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that, while "it was definitely not a recommendation made by the WHO," it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated," and said that "it had no precedent in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of the transmission among human beings outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak of public health of international importance (ESPII) during the first time of the pandemic (ESPII).
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that ESPII was "due to the risk of global spread, especially to low and middle-income countries without solid health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take action that unnecessarily interferes with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement."
On 5 February, WHO used the global community for a $675 million contribution to finance strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries "that do not have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if any."
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future." On February 11, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system in the response."
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated to coordinate the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will enable them to "focus on health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development implications of the outbreak."
On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team with China was activated to provide international and WHO field experts in China to assist in national management and to assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to conduct visits to the site to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural environments." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronary pandemic," and noted that it was not yet at a very early stage of preparedness for the pandemic. "
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high," its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for all world governments: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and we must be prepared, "insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid" the worst. "
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and noted that such a statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned, both at the alarming levels of spread and gravity, and at the alarming levels of inaction." WHO has received significant criticism for what is considered to be inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of all people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, persons in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes one policy tracker per country, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge of coronavirus.
The Chinese Government has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the United Kingdom Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, and the son of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his handling of the pandemic, which began in Hubei Province of China.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were dismissed due to their management of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political system's response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger from the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favour of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the USA or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has referred to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," and stated that "China's censorship overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which in turn was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distraction" from the failure of its administration to contain the disease. "
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government that described a stratagem of communications with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and the strategy was cited as "All about China."
We have been told to try to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Media such as Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send aid to virus-affected countries are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the policy of generosity."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively driving the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The United States authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
And there have been reports of mascarilla disputes among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity. "
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" which stated that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of undertaking an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction.
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, rejected the news reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a medical-assisted cargo aircraft to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment gain momentum, they will also be able to match if necessary."
The planned NATO military exercise "Defend 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defense 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of the troops of the United States and the various European countries involved, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government was heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament infected, as well as 15 other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, and said that his country was having difficulties fighting the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak boosted the demand for the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts anticipated that it may adversely affect Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Japan-South Korea diplomatic relations worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts," after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the removal of Moon for what they considered a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to praise its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, its Parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, to suspend Parliament and elections and to punish those who are considered to have disseminated false information about the virus and the government's management of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed for a number of cases of supply shortages, as a result of the increased use of equipment worldwide to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and the disruption of logistics and factory operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the empty shelves of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, leading to a shortage of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in the delivery of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also to delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment around the world, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
China and Italy & apos; s measures against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful, and have avoided an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its significant agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a press report of 16 March, China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the Government's efforts to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 per cent.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a threat of considerable destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences arises.
In January 2020, some analysts considered that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An expert estimate at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world's supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reportedly "revolted" after a sharp fall in oil prices due to China's lower demand.
On 24 February, world stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several US stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S & P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, published their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow fell 1191 points, the biggest fall in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indexes ended the week with casualties of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative perspective.
The actions fell again on the basis of fears for the coronavirus, the greatest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important travel season related to Chinese New Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year tourist events and attractions have been closed to avoid mass concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China & apos; s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year & apos; s holiday until 10 February, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80 per cent of GDP and 90 per cent of the country & apos; s exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected worldwide, with reductions in care hours or temporary closures.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50 to 60 per cent drop.
This also led to a 33 to 43 per cent drop in pedestrian transit to shopping centres in March compared to February.
The operators of shopping centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14 to 22 million more people in a situation of extreme poverty in Latin America than had been left in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the highest point of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers were stranded in their homes in the interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government support.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates from the San Luis Federal Reserve Bank. India's confinement has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment. Some 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the beginning of confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidized by the Government, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term labour compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of organizations and on the people, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Cultural and arts organizations sought to carry out their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of its employees and the public and to support artists where possible.
By March 2020, all over the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, entertainment sites and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases at an accelerated rate of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sports events and other social events, such as music and concert festivals, technology conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Lent Christian penance season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of taking part in Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels, and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then the sanctuaries were closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted the plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will "be rescheduled for a post-2020 but not after the summer of 2021." Casinos and other games around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to use the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their rates of new inscriptions. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as the Broadway theatres, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work through the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live concert broadcasts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
In line, numerous Internet memes were spread over the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and Eastern Asian descent, and people from areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world that they expressed that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a fair retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on and outside the Internet.
Following the progress of the outbreak towards new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to have experienced a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be suspected and xenophobic. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed calls for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag # ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
United States President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus," a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign evacuates from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from the north-east of India, who share a border with China and study in the main Indian cities, were harassed in connection with the coronary outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and intended for "waste."
Many newspapers with pay walls were removed for parts or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the chain reaction test of the polymerase with reverse transcriptase, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to inform or were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population as of March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had conducted tests for more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
This variability is also likely to be significantly affecting the rates of lethality for informed cases, which are likely to be very overstated in some countries.
Through the chain reaction of the polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (RRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopates or sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The chain reaction test of the polymerase with reverse transcriptase performed with pharyngeal hisopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In those infected with the test in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or the material that is removed by coughing (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was conducted in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), and was the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, South Korea's Kogenebiotech company developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the chain reaction of clinical grade polymerase (PowerChek Coronavirus).
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the approval of emergency use by the National Medical Administration of China of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their reaction panel in the chain of polymerase with a real-time reverse transcriptase for the new Courus (Cource-2019).
One in three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and a shortcut in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only thereafter was State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorisation, and the US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
As at 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of COVID-19 tests based on the chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, as at 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made evidence available for COVID-19 at national level.
No quantity limits were announced; the collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Center for Research on Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Health Care Surveillance. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests within a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the emergency use authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received the FDA's emergency use authorisation for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the isothermal amplification technology of nucleic acids rather than the polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to do 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed that uses a monoclonal antibody that is specifically linked to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, hoping that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
As of March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [computed tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms occur."
Typical TC features include bilateral multilobar opacities in glassware with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain develops, pattern in boning and consolidation.
According to a study in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared to computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended "not to use computed tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, CDC have recommended the chain reaction of polymerase as an initial examination.
Part of the immune system's reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and to monitor the population. They can be tested in central laboratories or by testing at the point of care.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single peripheral blood specimen is usually used, although serious specimens may be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a puncture in the skin.
Unlike the polymerase chain reaction methods, there is no need for an extraction step before the analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided proper notification to the agency and therefore can now distribute its antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epilto Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional chain reaction test of viral RNA polymerase.
The antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspected patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube," the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result at a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if used. In the tests in drive-through centres for COVID-19 of suspected cases, a health professional takes appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centres have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Doctors said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10,700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, the drive-through system was being tested in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, because only the positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that at least 483,295 samples had been analysed in the calendar week of 12 / 2020, up to and including the week of 12 / 2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) produced positive results for the SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion Institute and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for analysing samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping the samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI opened an emergency laboratory called "or" in Chinese "in 2000," he was able to process an improvised laboratory of "(").
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to cope with quarantine had doubled without this capacity for testing.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented to evaluate up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid handling robots.
By March, the shortage and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the United States.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to do more tests. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus detection tests per person in its population than any other country, and was aimed at increasing the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the level of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on the tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of evidence from South Korea helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for evidence due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of hypods and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to the incorrect collection of the samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would withdraw the kits that produced incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that proved to be imprecise.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use." The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they did not serve.
The conduct of tests, complemented by the quarantine of those who achieved positive results and the identification of the people with whom they had had contact who gave positive results in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests in the entire population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days apart.
Approximately half of the people who achieved positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from outside, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28 Singapore began to recommend to residents to stay at their homes, but schools reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracking, restrictions on travel from outside, testing and quartenten, but with less stringent confinement, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have done the most tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower case mortality rates, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who do not have symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 should send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as% of evidence" is influenced by the policy for the conduct of the country's tests.
A country that only tests people who enter hospitals will have a higher number of positive tests as per cent than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, micro-organisms or other unwanted substances.
The constant washing of hands with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by faecal-oral means.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or bird meat.
If no water or soap is available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing the meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food or animal waste.
The medical hygiene of hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
The washing of hands before the administration of medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove from your hands pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms that can cause a disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and to reduce the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in hand-washing practices can lead to small improvements in height growth for children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced with the introduction of simple behavioural changes, such as soap washing.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about one third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behaviour adopted in households, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children are charged per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning hand-washing with soap before eating and after using the bath into a deep-rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce to almost half the deaths from diarrhoea and to one quarter the deaths from acute respiratory infections.
In general, hand-washing is integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against impétigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that its frequent performance can cause skin damage due to skin dryness.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and makes the skin squamous known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common in health workers.
Too common hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OTC).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of the diseases: after using the bath (urinate, defecate), after cleaning a child's tail (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before / after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or bird meat.
Other occasions where a correct hand-washing technique should be used to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low hand-washing rate with soap.
A study on hand-washing in 54 countries in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families were doing hand-washing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand-washing with 97 per cent; the United States was about half with 77 per cent; and China had the lowest rate with 23 per cent. Currently, there are several methodologies for behavioural change, to increase the adoption of the habit of hand-washing with soap at critical times. The group washing of children at school at certain times of the day is an option in the hands-washing of children in the developing countries.
The "Essential Health Care Programme" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a tailor-made action to promote the health and education of children.
Spread twice a year, as well as washing hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of micro-organisms from the skin is improved by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of the soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired from previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Even so, the CDC states that "liquid soap with dispensation controls that do not involve using hands is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly promoted for a health-conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that using the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserve antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and protecting the skin, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, vegetable extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer containing trichlosan to prevent diseases and remove bacteria from the hands.
Nice hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 ° C).
However, warm jabonous water is more effective than cold jabonous water to remove natural oils that hold land and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a water-free agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the 21st century, the agents for the hygiene of hands without water and with alcohol to rub (also known as a hand solution for alcohol to rub, an antiseptic solution for hands to rub or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the alcohol drying effect.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol eliminate germs effectively.
Alcohol-based disinfectants to rub eliminate bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based disinfectants containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (3.5 logarithms reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 logarithms reduction) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient solution for antiseptic or alcohol-based hands should be used to rub, to wet or cover both hands completely.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and ends of all the fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel are dried.
The finger tips should also be washed well, rubbing in both palms. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend hand washing rather than hand disinfectants to rub, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and the rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for adequate hand washing unless water and soap are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can dry the skin unless emollients or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The alcohol dryness effect can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing emollients caused significantly lower skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions for rubbing are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause contact irritant dermatitis was attractive compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free agents do not remove organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for alcohol-free hands depends to a large extent on the ingredients and formula, and, historically, has been much less than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions for rubbing.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have been found to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is diminished after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or land.
Ashes or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the land or ashes are contaminated with micro-organisms, this can increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent, as, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand-washing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while the water temperature appears to make no difference.
Rub your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when they use soap than when they use water alone.
Restore for at least 20 seconds.
Restoring creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and restoring for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinse in a container can re-pollute your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
The wet and wet hands are more easily contaminated. The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and decarbed nail enamel can house micro-organisms.
Smoke lotion is often recommended to prevent the hands from drying; dry skin may cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate hand-washing when running water and soap are not available, for example, pour water from a hanging drum or pumpkin with appropriate holes or use ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home taps" and other economic options.
A home tap is a simple technology that consists of using a pitcher suspended from a rope and a lever powered with the foot to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a soap in a bar.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective drying form in public bathrooms.
More and more research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, Westminster University, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry association, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, by 194% in the yolks of the fingers and 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air-jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42% in the yolks of the fingers and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the yolks of the fingers and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, is said to be 180 m / s (650 km / h; 400 mph), managed to blow the micro-organisms of the hands and unit and potentially pollute other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spread the micro-organisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of micro-organisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the bacterial count were observed after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing hands with hand-disinfecting wipes is an alternative during travel, when there is no soap or water.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The washing of the hands of the doctors became compulsory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with their use.
The hands of doctors are washed for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and grind all parts of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed together by intertwining the fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water in your hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being further contaminated by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the medical care environment is to eliminate and avoid transmitting pathogenic micro-organisms ("germs").
According to New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit micro-organisms.
One study showed that correct hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood stream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing hand washing and standard hand rubbing in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before an aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap ("medicinal" or "antibacterial" soaps) gives the hand-washing agent the possibility of disposal.
This elimination may be necessary before surgery or in environments in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before a surgical operation, you need to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to wash and another sterilized instrument to clean under your nails.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, the water from the forearms should be prevented from returning to their hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical robe is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after caring for sick people.
To control staph infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of the washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases more than 35%.
Common soap washing results in more than three-fold incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to anti-bacterial soap washing. By comparing hand washing with an alcohol solution with hand washing with anti-bacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that alcohol rubbing reduced the contamination of bacteria by 26% more than anti-bacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing the A H1N1 flu virus and Clostridium hand-difficult spores than alcohol-based hand disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centres may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand disinfectant and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health-care environments.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is seen as an economic and fundamental tool for good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few hand-washing taps near public or private toilets, although there are economic options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing can also be the result of deep-rooted habits and not of lack of soap or water.
The promotion of hand-washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and cause a long-term change of behaviour in the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was noted that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing in PRBM, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three-Star" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective measures to ensure that students are hand-washed with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote hand-washing that are being carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve behavioural change. As a result of the colonavirus pandemic 2019-2020, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand-washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVAD.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting hand-washing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing."
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were caused by unpleasant odors called myasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-care-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more actively hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with "right hand-washing techniques" next to the washers of public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office and airport buildings.
The phrase "washing hands" is a statement of not wanting to take care of something or sharing the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase of much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represented her conscience of guilt about the crimes she had committed and which had led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value the elements for hand washing more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to be involved in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washing of hands in Christianity and Wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend the washing of hygienic hands, in particular after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force their hands to be washed after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sijism, Judaism and Islam force their hands to be washed before and after each meal.
Workplace risk controls at COVID-19
The risk controls at the workplace at COVID-19 concern the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and work task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contracting COVID-19.
According to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal work contact with the public and co-workers, for which measures are advised to prevent basic infections, including hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Work at risk of medium exposure includes work that requires frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by current community transmission or by an international trip.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and individual protective equipment available in case there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and funeral workers, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or handle samples of these people.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and individual protective equipment suitable for work.
The outbreaks of COVID-19 can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may fail to work for getting sick, for having to care for others, or for fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are required and the means of acquisition of such goods (such as buying in hours that are not peak, by means of home delivery services or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be discontinued. A plan for the preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various work sites and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Plans for the preparation and response to infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff members, protecting people at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining commercial operations and minimizing the adverse effects on other entities of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to workers' behaviour and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of individual protective equipment should be selected according to the worker's danger, placed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), used in an appropriate and systematic manner, frequently reviewed, maintained, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of in a correct manner so as not to contaminate.
According to the United States Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), work with lower risk of exposure has minimal work contact with the public and co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory hygiene standards that include covering for coughing and sneezing, the provision of paper handkerchiefs and waste containers, the preparation for teleworking or step shifts if necessary, the deterring of workers from using other tools and equipment, and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they stop having fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medicines to relieve symptoms or decrease fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, work at risk of medium exposure includes work that requires frequent or close contact to less than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person recently made an international trip to a site with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and the most at risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as protective covers of transparent plastic and the placement of a window for the care service so that the customer can request from the car, the administrative controls for this group and the groups of more at risk include the use of the workers who are left in the home, the use of protective equipment and the protection of the care of the workers, the protection of the workers, and the protection of the protection of the care of the workers, the care of the care of the workers, the care of the care of the workers, the care of the care of the workers, the care of the workers, the care of the care of the person, the care of the person, the person, the care of the care of the person, the person, the care of the person, the care of the person, the care of the person, the care of the person, the care of the person, the person, the care of the person, the person, the care of the person, the person, the care of the person, the person, the care of the person, the person, the care of the person, the person, the person, the person, the protection of the person, the person, the person of the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person of the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, and the person who is to provide of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the person, and the protection of the person of the person, the person, the person, the person of the person of the person, the person of the person, the person of the person, the person of the person, the person, and the person, and the person who is to whom they are to be of the person of the person who is to be of the person who is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to work.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect the workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the others at a distance of 6 feet, designating a crew member to attend to the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper handkerchiefs when he or she treads or sneezes.
The cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing the trip by disease, self-isolation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
The ideal is for medical control to be done in the cabin of the isolated person. In the case of schools and child care centres, the CDC recommends the short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical education or chorus classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between the desks, scaling in and out, limiting visits that are not essential and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of the classes. For police personnel who carry out daily routine activities, the CDC consider the immediate risk to health to be low.
Police officers are recommended to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers must clean and disinfect their working belt and equipment with a domestic cleaning spray or wipes before reusing them and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
Among the high risk of exposure work are those of the delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19.
These become very high risk of exposure work if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19 or if they take or handle samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests, or invasive sampling.
High risk exposure morgue work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the bodies of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected to have it at the time of death; these become very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19, even when they are performed with aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some medical care and morgue environments.
Samples should be handled taking Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter separate into different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been or are suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol-generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with NIOSH-approved filter mask or higher should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical tests.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples of COVID-19 patients, provide care or transport without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, glasses or facial protection, robe and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, the limitation of the permission to enter the room of a patient with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct care, the use of the same mask without removing it while providing care to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

CASE: [Covid-19] Lighten the burden and prepare for the future
DATE / TIME OF ENVIO: 14 March 2020, 00: 24 h, universal coordinated time
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic shows our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that form the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and the concern we have seen among all our colleagues in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible the people we are lucky to work with are.
I couldn't feel any greater thanks and pride for all of you being my partners.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites operational, helping our partners receive their payment or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, from this next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we thought would be an adequate response to what we are facing and how best to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, do shopping or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If he's sick, don't work.
Although you shouldn't have to say it, we say it.
There is no need to apply for sick leave or paid time off; just inform your manager and help your team review the calendars and schedules to ensure that the key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, tell Bryan, T & C Operations, so that T & C can help with the support and make sure that management is aware of your situation.)
People who work an hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff partners working per hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are ill and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we ask you to do is to contact your manager so that we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
Sites reliability engineering, human resources operations, trust and security and fund-raising teams, among others, are critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and to change our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Slow down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We do not plan to "double the hours to catch up" when the pandemic is over.
It will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and we will work to set new objectives and time frames where appropriate.
What about APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our Annual Planning 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that will allocate more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care of loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces the current planning charges and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as we have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues at the San Francisco office could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an anti-viral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own protocol of duty of care, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still in progress, but they may be delayed.
Some of our partners work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely since before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
It limits the duration of meetings to intervals of not more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to cut them off within several days.
It clearly defines the meeting with a list of topics and sends the reading materials in advance.
Adopt the use of the video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Describe a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls the questions in the chat and list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes in a collaborative way).
Send an email message to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the well-being refund for refrigerates.
Join the # removals channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the work distributed
The RR. HH. Operations team is analysing the ergonomics guidelines based on web seminars to support the increase in work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This last week we asked all beneficiaries of community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the editathons, until the WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to fulfil their part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or change those objectives.
This next week we will follow up with additional guidelines at Wikimania and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness about the interruption and, in part, relief for the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both that of Wikimedia and others.
From now on, CRT will be working to set up a Meta-Wiki page to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintain contact in relation to COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14: 00 h, universal coordinated time / 07: 00 h, Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional developments, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're available to help the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information of this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently largely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, some coverage problem or anything you may need help with, do not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have confidential or sensitive matters, send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered as a abandonment of our work and obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and obligations probably have to be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service in which it trusts.
Our planned work will remain there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and, possibly, in the coming months.
We need all of you so that this is possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of yourself and your families so that you can find yourself in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 contrasts the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a point of entry to cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal renal transporter domain of amino acids from the collection.
ECA2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with its enzimically active domain exposed to the surface of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is divided from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted into the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of the type II alveolar cells of the lungs, small intestine enterocytes, venous arterial and endothelial cells and the smooth muscle arterial cells of most organs.
The MRNA expression of ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, the striated body, the hypothalamus and the brain trunk.
The main function of ECA2 is to counter ACE.
The ACE splits the angiotensin I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 splits the amino acid carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also split several other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of membranes of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid transporter and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 espiona protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus together with the enzyme to the endosomes that are found within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host serine TMPRSS2 protease, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing the levels of ECA2 in the cells could help to combat the infection.
However, a number of professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE and BRA inhibiting therapy.
A review with systematic meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of pneumonia. "
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamic and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolisaccharide-induced acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour course of effect (duration).
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RA inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is high. The infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help with the tracking of contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with a infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular with regard to systems based on tracking the geographical location of application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be given to the government. "StopKorona!" was launched in North Macedonia, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a rapid response to health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetry application for patients living in Moscow who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, presented several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trust-only organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, about whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a statement demanding limits to this type of monitoring.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of the data would have to be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of this protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
Protection against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights established to respond to such abuse;
The significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders," including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be required. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) in Germany also published control lists.
The plan proposed by Google / Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, a network-based location tracking was used, rather than applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw data from locations present significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert about possible contacts, the government has also made the location information available to the public, which is allowed due to far-reaching changes to the information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
Tracking contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published research dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT / DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never come out of the device and all the matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group of the MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy by collecting and using location data or route intersection to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Out of control applications: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic," published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, a number of groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincident protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing the global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for a broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used for its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking that they assured would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, it is intended to implement the system in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance problems by distributing, first, the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b 'Reprofiling (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research that currently seeks to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites with the ligand.
The analysis of these binding sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papaine-like protease, RNA-led polymerase RNA, helicase, S protein and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that were then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and to recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antipaludic drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxichloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxichloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate through an urgent use authorisation (US).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised according to an USA only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but who cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxichloroquin for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
The doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul carries out a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical Faculty is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquin.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen stated that favipiravir was "clearly effective."
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen gave negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant or trying to conceive women.
A study of lopinavir / ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed."
The drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by joining protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticism has emerged about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV / AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir / ritonavir in the International Solidarity Study.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple philosopviruses, pneumovirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more severe disease and transmission.
Some initial pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with moderate disease and the other for those with more severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C are in progress for people hospitalized and seriously affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials with azitromycin antibiotic on 24 March 2020.
The National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (ciclesonide) of Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected by the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II study is ongoing and 200 serious patients will be registered in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of the mattress to reduce inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is registering 6000 adults aged 40 and over with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breastfeeding or non-affective contraceptive women are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, and the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On 14 April, a multi-centre study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium at preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying a lot of attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SRAG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible readjustments for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b 'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Among the dianas of the main platforms that went to phase I safety studies are the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, in total, 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (it is presumed that it is being planned or developed).
A phase I or II trial carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, controlled by placebo and performed in several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials often involve more participants, including a control group, and assess the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while monitoring the adverse effects that occur at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active developing vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet under human assessment (they were still in the "pre-clinical" research).
About 24 January 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular-bound vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at Saskatchewan University announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotechnological partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergency BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment of neoantigen vaccines against cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that the tests were beginning.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that a project was beginning to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical test and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although it is moving fast, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Health Research Institutes.
The possible vaccine is at the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Previously that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine," to which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an RNA-based vaccine.
The possible vaccine based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in pre-clinical trials and clinical trials are expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and that human tests of the possible final vaccine could start in the autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance of a vaccine against COVID-19 that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading to the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officers announced that scientists started testing animals for six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the London Imperial College announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, including a large number of possible vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronary outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced the tests of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and said that "the S1 subunit vaccines of the SARS-CoV-2 administered by MNA obtained powerful responses from antigen-specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacteria and produce virus-like safe particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, shows the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures for the handling of live viruses and for international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SRAG that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Nor is there a confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When SROM was widespread, it was believed that existing research on SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one SROM (DNA-based) vaccine completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovyric vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 causing virus was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the coronavirus of the SRAG.
b 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorganic insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets occur when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or to the surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread is also possible before symptoms occur and at late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hypopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they not be used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and bluish face or lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
It is less common to see symptoms in the upper airways, such as sneezing, nasal drip and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest oppression and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorganic insufficiency and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually from five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. Not all infected people are reported to have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to spreading the disease.
The proportion of infected people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. KCDC reported that 20% of the confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was conducted.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more droplets than when spoken with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering the mouth by coughing can cause the droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside the bedrooms of people gave positive in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR), may cause the aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of it spreading through the faeces, the risk is thought to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although the ease with which it spreads is not entirely clear, a person generally infects two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. Soap products degrade the lipid protective layer of the virus and deactivate it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in an average of two days after the beginning of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of trial.
Coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronavirus of a related nature.
Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus as it bursts its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells by the angiotensin I type 2 converting enzyme (ECA2), which abounds more in the alveolar type II cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect to ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe disease.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the evolution of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to heart receiving EC2.
The receiving ECA2 have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis. In the autopsies of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells that express respiratory tract ECA2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that pathogenic GM-CSF secretor T-lymphocytes are correlated with the recruitment of IL-6 secretor monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
In the autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done in airway samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal hisopate; however, samples of nasal or sputum hisopates may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples should be taken two weeks apart and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that the world's laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developing, but were not widely used.
The experience in China with the tests has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggested methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
The bilateral multilobular emerylated glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of the infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain may appear, pattern in disorderly boning (locular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data are available on the microscopic lesions and physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of the autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DHA is a cause of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ADS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommend covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and, if you do not have handkerchiefs, use the inside of your elbow.
Appropriate hygiene of the hands is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC have recommended the use of fabric tapabocas in public places, one of the reasons being to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling public multilevel meetings.
The distance patterns also indicate that people must keep a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, at the earliest, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flattening the curve."
The CDC also recommend washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after the nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in a timely manner. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to achieve, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for the antisepsis of the hands."
The glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are provided with support care, which may include rehydration, oxygenotherapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommend that those who suspect they have the virus use a simple mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OECs) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analysed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Support treatments may be useful for those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the China National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pneumologists in the United States compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend acetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen.
Caution should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health-care environments when procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation, are performed.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. The CDC highlight the guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (PPC) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is EPP robe, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, respirators are preferred (instead of masks).
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use by an urgent use authorisation (US).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but the effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product's indications is not guaranteed.
Where no masks are available, CDC recommend the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for people hospitalized with COVIDA-19-related respiratory failure and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to people in critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases occur mainly in adults over 60 years of age and in particular over 80 years of age.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, which limits the ability of the health system to manage the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support from ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is becoming more and more difficult.
Respirators that have different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
The older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take until 2021, several medicines that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in tests on the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. FDA granted temporary authorisation to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application may detect "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection by means of surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is identified, the application not only recommends self-containment, but also alerts local health officers. Analysis of the macrodata of cell information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they were in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track data on the mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who can come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared summary data on the location of the phones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine non-compliance.
The regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile phone operators have informed him that "in any case, 40% of people continue to move."
The German government carried out a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may feel anguish about quarantine, travel restrictions and the side effects of treatment or fear infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety for health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may follow a mild evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will look like other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of a serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and SROM, but COVID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to the water difficulty syndrome (SDRA) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorganic failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting impairment, and heart, renal and liver damage.
The change in coagulation, specifically the increase in protombine time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while the alteration in renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average time of seven days was spent between hospitalization and death.
In an emerging case study, the mean time from the onset of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a complete range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological tests of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopatic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs was similar to acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ADS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the March United States data, 89 per cent of the people hospitalized had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic aspects of a region could also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient count of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or to die compared to non-smokers. They are concerned about the long-term consequences of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30 per cent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung images suggest organ involvement.
This can also cause the post-recovery intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity for people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity appears to be possible, based on the behaviour of other coronavirus, but cases recovered from COVID-19 have been reported and later positive in coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin through an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost completely due to transmission between humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of the onset of symptoms as at 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
In general, a number of measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, as well as being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time that has elapsed since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO allocated CIE-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 infection to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rate of lethality reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall mortality rate is 6.9 per cent (153,822 / 2,240,191) as at 17 April 2020.
The figure varies by region. Other measures include the rate of lethality in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the rate of lethality in infected people, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-dependent and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence may provide information on how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger ones, resulting in relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths from COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for both men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50, and the gap between men and women is only 90 years old.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 for men and 1.7 for women.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
The gender-based immune differences, the lower number of women smoking, and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age may have contributed to the highest mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men and 72 per cent of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track gender information in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAG, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations, to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the responsible COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
It is common for "coronavirus" to be used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus de Wuhan."
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory water disease by 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication that they do not use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hypods and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed the valve of a respirator as a matter of urgency and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company did reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed during the night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, theories of conspiracy, false information and disinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged that were rapidly spread over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Test" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use receiving ECA2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 virus infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensibilizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the receiving ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a four-volunteer vaccine in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains a harmless copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxichloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, including nine phase III remdesivir trials in several countries, which are due to report by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible drugs against COVID-19 was under way. Several antiviral medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19 are evaluated, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is an attempt to demonstrate the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the investigation.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent use authorisation for hydroxichloroquin and chloroquin at the discretion of patients treated with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after the determination that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial barley of the S protein that performs transmembranal serine-protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with receiving ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxicloroquine with or without azitromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines may be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxichloroquin may have properties that prevent cytokine release. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment patterns after the completion of a small study.
It is found in a non-randomized national phase II test in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a blood analysis of serum ferritin to identify cytokin releases, these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people, will be offset.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of other-induced steroid-resistant cytokin release syndrome, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no non-randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with non-conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which a passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
