What do you say? The ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry shop
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will, it seems, have to overcome the obvious linguistic barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed DOS partners.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new Council of the ČSSD to check their knowledge of the slang marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition were ruling Prague.
The encoded dictionary that used the flower and political cream of Prague during the previous period, of Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't really know."
"I am more of a novice in praguense politics," he said during the examination of "collugueo" terminology the town council of culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And as for the political veteran, Karel Březina reacted equally.
You may know the concept of the "golf hole."
"It's probably the only expression of everyone you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, I don't usually use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the DOS voting congress, the drafting chose six examples, in particular those that are particularly related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort," "Prague's biggest golf hole," "go to the pastry," "bull's head," "betrayal of the capital" and "armored."
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't get into these things, and I'm not going to appreciate how the civic Democrats have fun."
"What I do care about is how we will understand ourselves in the implementation of our programmes," he said.
As has been seen, Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not say anything; the only term that hit the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague."
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know more about the news."
"I'm gonna have to aim for a language course," he's kidding.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the environmental councilman Lukáš Plachý.
Then, both socio-Democrats know who Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý really is, even know where to find that character; and he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop."
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it is soon revealed to Plachý which is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-Democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really doesn't seem like we have anything like it."
"Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we make word games with names," says the President of the ČSSD praguense, Petr Hulínský, whose party partners call Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues also call me that," she confesses her own nickname Karel Březina.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper tested the name and it works.
For his party partners, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they joined before the deceit elections during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his partners.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that the socio-Democrats tolerate in the speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this praguense president.
"The doctor of the rights of the batons" reportedly recalls that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "witches," as published in a brochure
Women considered as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are often old, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "turn" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the town.
"Men rarely suffer such as that."
"Healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help work and have children," explains a nun who, in the state capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso is working in a special residence of more than 100 women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure."
He issued an information brochure that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a hit.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," says the Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Allegations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, a neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, last week Ammy Hemmah, 72, died when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate group of circumstances.
According to his version, the woman was lit in the oil that is used for ritual anointions.
He was on fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human soul devorers always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in the Gambia last year the President still took part in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a wide hunt for witches who had allegedly been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself by means of black magic."
"To help him, he brought Chamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the President's personal escort, were forced to take men and women randomly chosen among the Gambian peoples to the President's property in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in his report.
On the farm, the arrested people had to drink a podium of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, some 1,000 people were finally released.
The tenant of Bakala: is heated with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, old and old, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of the "coal magnate" Zdeńek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he had documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his, his daughter's, and his son's, who is serving his sentence.
All three have just been caught up in the liberalization of rents.
Instead of CZK 3,500 per month, the child will pay as of next year CZK 4,100 for a two-room apartment with separate second-category kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains half-angry, half-resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent," recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when it will publish a guide informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, the man only makes an admonition.
"Each one says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great test laboratory for liberalization.
After New Year will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at 9: 00, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to take number.
"Rental 2011," can be read on a bright button of your touch screen.
When you push it, a little piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
It hardly gives time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located on the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an old marriage comes to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will reach in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them a rent increase of between 15 and 38% in the cards.
On November 18, a special window opens at the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," they answer, after briefly hesitating, the workers who are in it when the client shows up as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old floors for Bakala miners are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from the ČSSD, has already dealt with them in high and clear terms and now they appear in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change my fucking bathroom dish," the man mentioned in the introduction is unchoked.
According to the workers, at the moment they come more than anything retired to check if they receive a rent discount if they sign on time, as the RPG special offer promises.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract by 15 December will also receive half of the February rent discount.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" is certainly not able to dispel the avalanche of doubt.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only asked about the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," the window employee estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts where necessary.
If the two parties fail to reach an agreement on rent, an independent judge shall settle the matter.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed possible and fully in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
"No one will be judged here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court," he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he says.
The regulation of rent will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," says Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community that angers the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that highlight in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be at most CZK 7.50 per square metre per month," is indicated on the screen.
Just increase by 38% the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 kroner per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not suddenly affect rents, but will scale from four to eight years.
In addition, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the increase of the rent (see the graph) again on the floors, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority shall be given to persons who sign the rental raise agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The Avriopint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides in his interior a small nursery with all the same to such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch.Design. can come to it.
The Arch.Design architectural project company, from which many known buildings from Brno came out, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopint building to include a space for its mini-business.
In the company work about 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow the architects and artists to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of a reduced schedule, day care is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its workers within the framework of its social program.
The builders and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of the children.
The mini-business was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-business is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
With the funding granted (over CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified staff and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), the company Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-business running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the Economy Rating company contributed to the application for funding.
The care of children is provided by qualified personnel; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day long for their care. The day-care centre currently accommodates children without age limits, although most of them are under the age of three.
Since it is a "mini-shop," it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with the shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the day-care centre is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the day-care centre, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is individual education and care, the contents of the mini-school programme are comparable to the regular pre-school programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach even English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of late picking up children from school when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the companies that they sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this programme strengthened the marketing of personnel.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Watch the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remember the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its similar shape to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it "the house of the bones."
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the new use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds of the scales and the omnipresent lines gently curved, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with oniric lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
With more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought-out order are observed.
At night, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the torsion of forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The wavy wood copies the frames of the windows, the rails, the ornaments of the doors, the pears and the signs.
The Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, emerged from the remodeling of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on bringing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of various apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in its plans of the project, ornaments emerged for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and Güell de Gaudí Park, where other pieces of the house are located.
Because of its organic form, the premises soon after its completion were nicknamed "the house of the bones."
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the house of the yawns."
It is also said that, on top of the construction, the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique system in the house for the central heating period with ventilation vents and the typical chimneys.
It may be strange to see his inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not at all respect the construction rules of the moment and was not allowed to influence them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although clearly in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the town hall was so shocked with the result that it asked to be corrected.
He was concerned, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, but on the contrary: only fifteen days after the city's request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform were to break all the straight angles and lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without any problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors provides the maximum light on all the floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the rays of sun.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the World Heritage List of the Humanity of Unesco.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and to the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not negligible, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and the holders of the tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true environment of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the nearby houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the somier: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous bed frame; what really confers its quality on a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the somier.
First of all, they must be perfectly complemented so that they are adapted to the specific users.
During the election, numerous elements, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner, come into play.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the somier are located is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" more slowly.
In addition, they tend to weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the central channels are not properly aerated and above, they are found on a firm basis, they keep the moisture inside. Mold may even appear below.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and harder surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer."
"These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who time nervous system problems, so they get bad joint and skin information," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have been preferring viscoelastic mattresses for some time.
"Today it's no longer a problem, because they have these proper Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropical brand."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape as a function of absorbed heat or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard match.
He just sleeps better.
The viscoelastic also works as protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
For single rooms, for example single rooms, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For a possible visit to be also comfortable.
"If not, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: by lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably clogged towards the elbows," says Helena Prokopova, expert from Cechu čalouníků a dekoratérț, who has been dealing with the problems of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a theme he teaches in specialized schools for many years.
In the double rooms, each needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the soybeans at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with a minimum of 15 cm inside springs, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"By touching it with the hand or by settling on the mattress, no doubt the docks should be noticed," says Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a certain type of somier.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your case, which is often done today.
And, since every night we breathe between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, the specialists reject the slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a guarantee for life.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the sellers give a tip: on the mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of the cleaning and washing of the case, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although at present, zipper-closed mattresses are made throughout their perimeter, so when they are opened they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and washing machine size!), their handling in larger models (and for one person) when lifting the mattresses may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a somier, do you have a firm board?
Never!
At most for the beds thought to spend one night visiting.
However, it must make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes on the table and should be used with a mattress with docks inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses must not be used on such bases.
For non-articulated and 14-18-sheet soybeans, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although it is always better a soyer with a higher number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the lumbar-area sheets are reinforced and their stiffness can be regulated.
Articulable sheet loungers should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to the claim.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "surround" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by the mattress manufacturers who, in the "men," began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are soybeans with cross or tablet structure with the so-called multitorsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is reduced.
It should also be borne in mind that, even if you use the appropriate mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (large and "muffled"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder reinforcement or the softer area of the mattress) than the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do with, it seems, the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, the biological mattresses are in fashion.
The oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, such as castor soya.
In fact, practically all known manufacturers use soya.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
In addition, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress case, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also choose microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with vegetable extracts of breeze, so that the mattress case absorbs the heat and refresh the body, women prefer to "heat" the case.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warm.
The favorites today?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities makes it possible to make mattresses from different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels are going.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who have a therapeutic function often have lower VAT, as they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's hard to save on the mattresses and somieres.
Sometimes you can approve the offers of manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duoffer mattresses with a memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 kroner.
The second one is obtained free of charge.
The viscoelastic era with an open cell structure and a high density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
It initially emerged as a material for NASA, because during the retreats, astronaut loas were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur is softened with heat and hardened with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body has a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
It is therefore ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only in mattresses, but also for medical products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents use people's monitoring devices to control their children
The fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a match box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Anička and information was started on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell us that it is not a question of spying, but of another means of reducing the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of monitoring devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their view, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that, if the child does not want to take him, he will simply throw him away.
"Even the younger children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to prevent them from being controlled."
"Before, parents were very confident in mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," says Bočková.
In his view, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check whether the child has any electronic device that can reveal his / her location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of the tracking devices is being extended, it will also look for them, since their sale will no doubt be made with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a paedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the monitoring device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, at least you will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices have an integrated tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stays still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In his view, such a service can be obtained even with mobile phones with navigation, where only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment these are devices with a size similar to a match box or smaller mobile phones.
They can therefore be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital watch.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a possible aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or to identify him after some time, which can make the police earn time," he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough fuses to surround all of Czech, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of fuse to light explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of fuse to its arsenal.
They therefore have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the fuse is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosive fuse from the STV Group, a. For 40 million kroner.
The General's staff responded to MF DNS by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of fuse, saying that the soldiers need for the training maneuvers 60 kilometres of fuse per year.
According to the estimates of the army pyrotechnics, with which MF DNS was contacted, it is decided, however, that in such a case, they should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high-command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want to be exempted, nor did Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend 60 kilometres of fuse.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if that were the case, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of fecha, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the engineering or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained in person recently to Minister Vondra because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even the practices of shooting for money are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also cannot understand that we are repeatedly bought such amounts of fuse."
"But it is your decision and you will no doubt know why you act like this."
"For us, the army is a good client that, as a company, we try to satisfy," says STV Group's commercial director, Jan Děcký.
The spokesman for the Jan Pejšek Ministry of Defence defends the hundreds of miles of fuse, also saying that he will have stockpiles of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, of STV Group, indicates that the fuse has only a life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, because of the possible criticism of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each munition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometres of fuse, it got a discount.
"It cost us 60% less than last year's request of 244 kilometers," says spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's shopping centre.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of fuse of the police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the ammunition from World War II or left by the Soviet army, has not been more than 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before the end of their useful life.
They decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of fuse can be achieved.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in completing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with which MF DNS spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of kilometers of old fecha, which is now being bought "cheap," will have to be removed.
So far I'm still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest.
The winning of the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition, won the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
Her success story seems to be taken out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
He realized abroad that there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price in Liberec.
With the savings he brought together with seasonal work abroad and a bank credit he bought a house that was half-run, composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price ratio of the accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income I got was investing them back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it has gradually managed to open in Liberec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, it opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said the number one businessman last year.
"This sale of hotel opening licences helped to a great extent to win the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' contest," he added.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in and around Liberec.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It certainly recommends that everyone want to try some company to participate in the competition.
But he believes that there is no need to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he may not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that received general recognition."
"It is not, much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It is only my name that appears on the front page," Lukáš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a year quieter than we've had in Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already been through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone contest "Company of the Year," last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skaliza into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence in fighting competition," says last year's winner.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Žárský's father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also had a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the competition in the media.
"Not only did our customers start to consider the Farmet brand to be considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country," says Karel Žárský.
Last year maybe it wasn't just a sign of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
It also obtained recognition for trade performance up to 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, led companies to stop their investment projects and to start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, are not free of such a situation."
"Income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some redundancies," explains Karel Žárský.
A viable company must, at times, even take unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut expenditures was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, we strengthen the presence on the international market and we have obtained great valuations at national fairs," says Žárský.
It all indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous standards
The Absurdez of the year survey is part of the corporate tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than one third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it checks the insured's taxes," said ČSSZ's spokesman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Absurdez of the year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and employers in Czech Republic must respect and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny for the fourth time and begins to create a hobby also among the general public.
While last year's edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it reached almost four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have a number of full legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in the number of roles necessary for the tax declaration we are in the world's first place," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years now, the simplification of business standards has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement particularly in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a company, the Czech Republic is in position 74th, that is, eight posts worse than last year.
The Absurdez of the Year competition was held for the first time in 2006 and each year is repeated in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firrooku.cz. Then the competition organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firrooku.cz / absurdito and www.ihned.cz.
He wins the absurdity that receives the most votes.
This year's survey presented more than a hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional and journalist associations.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and motorways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year's 70 proposals is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held in early November in the square of Wenceslao in Prague, is part of an event in which people from the political and social world often participate.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the Eva Svobodová competition, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Employers of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the State continually hampers entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate at least 30 paragraphs each year that are currently unnecessarily complicating trade," said Martin Kocurek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not remain in the water of drafts.
In 2007, what most disturbed people was the employer's obligation to communicate with a three-day advance to the business office in the area of permanent operation, the intention to go to a fair or exhibition with a position.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in the number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the work office by their foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was removed in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one's the winner.
The Absurdez of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
This year, therefore, the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny contest is the category called Company responsible for the year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support the responsible and fair companies.
"In this way, we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, the organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebelde contest of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of the main competition of Vodafone Company of the year 2010, companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective were presented.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between the two, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, these are for example persons with disabilities, in other cases the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the 14 finalists throughout the Republic, for example, was the Paguense Et Netera software company, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor of funds for the sponsorship of disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paper store that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, as they make up more than 70% of the staff; therefore it received the title of Enterprise responsible for the central area of Chequia and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended third in the region.
In Olomouc he won the MiRyz Soft accounting company, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also given because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT Enlogit company in the region of Ustí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them a chair and ergonomic keyboards; it also supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"We also support the" Person in distress "scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," said the representative of the company Ondřej Suchý.
They are also in good place with a mention of the laundry company Praní to čištění of the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that have an impact on their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, from the construction company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year were automatically appointed and sent to the organizers before August 15.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the contestants did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Enterprise contest responsible for the year, but they are not disqualified from the" main "Vodafone Enterprise of the year contest."
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the company's main competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose's advice.
Police arrested during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police made several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a specific interested party.
I had to pay Luboš G. half a million kroner for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribe during a public auction and public tender," the head of the general prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that for the moment she cannot disclose further details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the 46-year-old businessman was released by the police.
On how it could influence the public auction, given the limited official information, it can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund responded to Právo's questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and was during a public auction.
"This is a client, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Call for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a higher value than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Depending on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the most offer," explained the Fund's spokesman.
Luboš G. had information about who was to be presented for the call and, since he is at the same time an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, I had so much money on me.
Luboš G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of former PF Chief Václav Sankot, who was charged with the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund land for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly where a large road should be built to the industrial area of Borská pole.
He then changed them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the town council had to intervene because otherwise the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families are required to pay an additional fee of several hundred kroner per month
Since January, households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to remove several hundred kroner a month more than now from the portfolio from January.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas by about 2%, in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The increase in electricity for families living in apartments should be about 100 kroner a year more than now.
However, the main electricity providers reduced prices, as support for energy production from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas is moderately increased, especially at the time when heating is used most and, therefore, consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple more hundred kroner per year.
While electricity and gas are growing all over the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the households of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January for central heating about 50 kroner per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 kroner per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Prussians will pay an additional 6.8%.
The prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In the north of Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be increased by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 rented apartments in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns in Ústí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rent.
The regulated rents, which benefit residents of about 300,000 floors, could increase next year to 10%.
The Czech young people get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in shape, because it takes effect slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers to end up in medical care at a age of less than 15 years.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in the hospital's pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer in fashion, because it takes them a long time to get drunk."
"Now the fashion is the strong alcoholic drinks," the head of pediatrics at the Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán, tells Právo.
"When you get a bottle from your father's cupboard, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it is lightened with juice and that it does not smell so much," he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"It's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use spirits they took at home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikan, 13-14-year-old drinkers are the ones who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
"It started at the age of 12, when they brought it with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," the department's doctor says about this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that your mother was not surprised that your daughter was missing 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the parents' lack of interest or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that in the case of children, there is no proper talk of dependence.
"An alcoholic means a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is due rather to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, forty drunk children were hospitalized this year at Motol's paediatric clinic until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who come with serious poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after a medical examination, go home to the parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to cases where children simply meet after school and drink spirits, for Pelikan there are three seasonal ups and downs that can be mentioned: the witch's day, the end of the year and the end of the school year.
"In such circumstances, drink by the bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"On the day of witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at the same time," Pelikan adds.
Drinks who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by the injection of a serum with glucose and the nutrients that are missing from the body.
"These carry it much better, for after the agitated night, they rise up well and do not hurt anything."
"They are only confused about where they are," says Pelikan, adding that, often, patients lose their good mood at least when they see the costs they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost a dozen thousand kroner.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when I tell children directly at the visit how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job to earn enough to pay for that night," Pelikán added.
The health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which often gives people back the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are first found in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa-EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time that a device of this kind has been found in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
This is the bisquare version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-position.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peješk, of the defence press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the planes will be physically removed from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-position aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the fixed-wing aircraft long ago, with no investments or additional contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplaza were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army did not run out of two-square aircraft, as in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract of 200 million kroner for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-places.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed to the aircraft being added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the company EADS is the one that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how they will be used in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner were approved last year by the Mirek Topolánek government.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for an invitation to tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence management states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired from Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by making a European invitation to tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army already received three Casa aircraft and the last one should arrive at the Praguense airport of Kbely in 14 days.
An index finger longer than the ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annul are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer magazine.
It may depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger may help to determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right-hand Indian finger shorter than the ring.
They had the same chance of suffering prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
For men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men below 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "fully demonstrated."
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, sunrise on snow-covered Thursday.
The roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the cutting-off machines all night throughout many areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between km 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ustředniho automotoklubu (UAMK).
A truck was damaged at km 91, and two industrial vehicles were hit at km 93, causing injuries.
A number of cars also ended up in the gutter.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks were hit there.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno at kilometer 190 or through Brno and enter at kilometer 182 at Kývalce.
There they have formed several kilometres of jams.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, just next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a multi-centimeter snow layer and the thermometers indicate -7 ° C.
Traps are being formed for example in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams are running late, for example in the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míu.
At 8: 00 in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from 11: 00 on Wednesday night to 5: 00 in the morning.
At present, most of the roads in the south of Moravia can be moved, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska, three secondary roads are closed to circulation, in Brněnska snow languages are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
The connections are so far closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalica - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment, it cannot be said when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of the Karpacy Bílé (White Carpathos).
The roads of the region which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In Chequia they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfalls gradually refer to the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the encoded name XM-25.
The generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and to "change the progress of the game" make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun with an extremely precise aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains cause it to actually work like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
There is no doubt that normal protection can be used and, when it launches its murderous rain of metal splinters, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use a "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then get a precise point of view and, depending on it, correct the projection line and pull the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the weapon is loaded and the projectile is launched at a distance of 543 meters, plus less than one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are moved
The Fujitsu consortium moved its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg al Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moved its branch to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
As the computer sector giant and his maintenance on Wednesday reported, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg al-Astro Park, a large office complex at Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term an additional 100 employees from the consortium, who were previously spread throughout the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the collective office in Astro Park will favour the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is now very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region brought joy yesterday among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt's head of the economy, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this has won a "Global Player."
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site."
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The management previously informed the city about its intention.
"We have naturally offered the company our help," said Korwisi.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic reasons caused the fall.
In such a way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous place.
"I hope the owner and the landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years from a controversial project to build the spa city.
As a joint project of the city and of a private company of projects between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the mass building that previously used the holes as parking spaces and for the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advice and valuation companies, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, have been installed as well as then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, based in Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest IT supplier in the world.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented into the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name refers to its star-shaped plane, houses, among others, the central association of electrotechnics and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
The anguish is taking over more and more from Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet service provider has removed the revelations platform from your server.
Political pressure may be found behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly detained in England.
The Wikileaks revelations platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the Wikileaks boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's list of wanted people, must remain in detention in Britain, according to one article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon's server."
"To speak freely in the country of freedom," revealed the revelations activists through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon services web to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we will allocate our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, the CNN network reported according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate for the security of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, the British said "Guardian."
"I had wanted Amazon to take these steps before, before previous information publications classified by Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and unconsidered process of Wikileaks puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," was stated in a statement by the independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted persons.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has constantly described the investigation in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks' spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, stated in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
"That is why we are afraid for Assange's security," Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to the North American statements.
In the Americas, Arkansas's former Republican governor, Mike Huckabee, stated that the person responsible for Wikileaks' revelations must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, a counselor to the head of government Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, said, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, a big dispute is growing.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for American President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has requested the resignation of the Secretary of State, in case she is responsible for recently ordering diplomats to be involved in espionage.
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, the Deputy Director of Distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed exceptional manager, announced the White House.
So Travers is responsible for developing "important structural reforms," which are necessary in the light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
The "Gelato University" in Bologna is preparing ice cream in the best times of the year.
The basic three-day course for future jams has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream really come from?
The gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelataio takes out with a spatula the cream from the ice cream from the counter, extends it over the deck and sells it.
To know this, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic three-day course for future jams has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practice in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk in the soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a California art teacher, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product on the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of his own in a few years in a hard work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
The master ice cream Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste, but also its silky softness and good consistency, are decisive.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national top house and mainly of the southern part of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and so every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then it opens the tap of the machine and comes out a basic pasteurized white cream, the basis for all types of milk frost.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can the ice cream be made only with natural elements or without stabilising?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they be taken away from the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients," has perhaps used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar rubber, of guar bean.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
Besides, there's powder and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to strain flavoured ingredients into their goods."
"But you must experience once."
Whether with fruit sorbites with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the course participants can use the ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, moca and hazelnut ice cream each time, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less the aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
That you know better doesn't necessarily depend on you having more tofe or more fruit mashed.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to taste like nuts if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a problem of artimetics: Peach mashed with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra piece of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the fruit types (measurement of the winegrower for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables make the account easier.
Elaborating ice cream requires only physical application, as before.
It does not only help the utensil for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled at low-zero temperature.
In spite of all, all the automation is left out in terms of the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit mashed, as if it were a mini-first giant without control.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time for something like this to happen."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Effa has infiltrated the industry it experiences with transgenic plants.
The issue is currently being raised by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Effa group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another Effa expert are also engaged for years in the Ilsi association.
consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the Etisa verification standards for genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interest, he criticizes Then.
The provisions of Effa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is in fact controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has been critical of a collision of interests.
So, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa was without the support and transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which carried out the General Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Etisa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided they are of high and technical quality, and are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Etisa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US
It is called a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, including for risk assessment for biotechnology without Lobby.
On this subject, independent experts, such as Then, criticize the fact that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not proven.
"We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how are they to be found?," he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"The industry controls the safety investigation," Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was at the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind my back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to take down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again was the same: thousands and thousands manifested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was rubble.
It's broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Railsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He is enthusiastic: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke from the cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier French Navy ammunition tank, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He's bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, grind the gravel or send it to the dumpster," he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guard's house.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the shooting.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 S21 enemies took the 80-kilo cut mazizo, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest of it's been sold for a while.
Owner of gardens, landscaping gardener, project manager.
They came from all over and took what they could take in the trunk and over.
The Stuttgart stone of the impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He goes up to his SUV, takes a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And she's a stone lover.
Seal to 4,000 tons of stone.
He's carrying his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the biggest tracker of ancient stones in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic stones of chopped sandstone.
"They lost to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge," he explains.
It limeals dawn, yellow, warm, she gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
He points out a lot: Red herring, an earlier piece of the Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Nice travertine."
The mazizos formerly belonged to the Neckarstadt rostrum of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite of the Sankt Blasien church, Alba of Heilbronner hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple mating and a wagon, he feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
It has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave the stone dealer, also quarterers, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the man who takes care of the remains.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to rescue.
Talent struggle around great potentials
There's an active influx into the buffet.
16 students are agitated around the muffins, the tomato soup and the sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and Vokswagen car manufacturer have invited students in mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, you have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Your mission: To hire the most talented students in the universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications about their students' skills, they try to satisfy exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of the project at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium is won to the talents.
A lady from the staff department delivers pens, gumites and folders with the VW logo.
It explains to the illustrious young talents the programs of practice and the works for students and shows them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle from Braunschweig Technical University carries out the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, look closer to interesting candidates and consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, Seelle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point was previously in the technical projects," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies are no longer able to choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not that they have to be announced and, above all, to achieve a highly skilled workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineering posts in October.
And, according to the prognostics of the VDI, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS co-ordinated.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the crème of the crème of many participants goes to the US
The universities are increasingly trying to choose and polish the high potential of the universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey alone was short."
For the Dykta scout the notes give results.
"So far we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises, which are classic with their work fairs, are also on the hunt.
"We try to get students at the specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sisha Stübe, in charge of personnel for the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacant posts on the company & apos; s website.
"It is very difficult to fill the vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, Freiberg University.
"Teachers advise that you can do practice with us or perform your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
This is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, standard hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff member.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The key factors are flexible working hours, child care or good promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutions, Solarworld holds square 55 among Germany's 100 best employers.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in the work and he observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her classification by her job seekers.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly focused on the external classifications of an employer potential," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies to want a long-term strategy that will gain a good reputation as employers.
It brings your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to get attractive as an employer goes through the employees themselves," he says.
In the jargon of the sector is called the internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When people are well treated and identified with the company, then they get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with a gang," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Since the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thus annulled its previous plans without appeal.
Also on the Atlantic coast, new drills are still closed for the time being.
This announced the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which at least will be in force for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the greatest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the US's dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified of who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the interior, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various peterolero consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
At present the responsible control authority, which has been charged with corruption charges, is being reformed at the root.
Obama also announces that the lucrative tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction in the Gulf will be less due to stricter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by the BDO advisory company - before Wednesday's mining ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about the insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investment in new extraction projects is soon to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marron, it smells like a gas station: Millions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with it.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist realizes journalists: "Today he will pass enough oil before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been able to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil stains float on the surface.
Before here he took shrimp with fists, explains Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach full waters of fish: That, in the heart of the Niger delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinking regions in the world.
On the road to the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, which immerses its hand in the water, will take out a few full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark prayerful sticks, sadly isolating the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain, flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is shut, a kind of ghostly calm from an earlier paradise with the smell of gas station is expanded in it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The area of the settlement of the ogoni is a conniving battlefield for years: Here more than 60 years ago the first European explorers broke in, here was organized the first resistance in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, the return of the companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: As more than two million barrels of black gold were pumped daily from all over the delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipes, the oil fields in Ogoniland were calm, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters, steel platforms such as water sculptures stood out: "Christmas arbolitos" affectionately called the head of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them present a total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, so he has a constant jet of oil in the water.
According to the experts' assessments, more than two billion litres have been poured in 50 years into the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the damage of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the long-lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil robberies are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the heads about to break and the pipes with leaks as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally in the world conventional, the scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the pipe defect rates are "over a multiple higher than elsewhere."
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: they are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes linked to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily spread on the ground, there is a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group's head.
First, the petrol penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally exits diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-litre diesel daily: "It provides us with 34,000 naira," about $22.
The delta people take advantage of the fuel shortage in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "those of the bunkers," who trashed the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million litres of oil are lost a day throughout the Niger delta.
Only a negligible part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in aljibes and sell it cheap on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate purely academic as to whether the environmental disaster is due rather to the management of the population or the weak way of production.
"If the oil companies did not act as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the ogoni are mainly destroyed by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as the Chinese one."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," says the musculous Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them to arrest them, but to arrest them with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This condemned invention has completely torn our country apart," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much more lucky than you can imagine: The Australian air safety authorities perceived thanks to their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and they warned of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a connection of sleeves, fissures can be caused by fatigue or cracks, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines made by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal measures against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a complaint at the Sidney federal court that allowed for more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will carry out more safety tests for superjubos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its fleet A380 on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa reinstated the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-deck plane is the world's largest passenger plane.
A Nevada all over the country causes chaos in traffic
Germany is completely white: From day to day it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
The winter ice Germany: In almost the whole country, gallid temperatures were reached on Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
At the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the snowplotters are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind raches sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on national highways and roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of snow that has just fallen and cold and strong winds are in charge of swirling it.
There many trucks and cars were trapped during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disorders on the streets.
In A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created jams.
In Thuringia the snow affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the trees down on the lanes or the destroyed catenaria and the holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the interurban service of Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop his trip to Munich.
The firemen and the rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
The snow winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokesman there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The snow drains are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, although there are 400 tents ready for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train at a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to the snowy streets: here too a truck was reached at a road crossing because the vehicle was stranded.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the Bayreuth to Nuremberg route was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after taking a ride with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
The meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and more dust-like and therefore will be swirled into soft rachas.
But the wind will fall.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to one article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently arranged its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt bank district; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of reonvation, and seeks a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" says on the basis of a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the project sale.
"We always check whether to own the properties or sell them and then rent them back," he said.
This is why Germany's largest credit institution resigns its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached some EUR 200 million.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the newspaper towers known as "Greentowers" at about 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor, it has not been revealed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people grieving for the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who became dead after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago, an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the site of misfortune, but it did not discover any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to lower for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts argued that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
They have not been able to recover the bodies to date.
The family and friends now remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the glowing shine of the sun in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In tribute to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved at half a mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said John Key, the President of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
"He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body," Lawrie Drew said, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Many foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative event with the president of the government and the families of the victims.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
The rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to fall, said Gary Knowles, the police superior, to the journalists.
To hell with it, warrior!
Does the gore fit into the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Waring Refn reexplore the gender borders with his epopeia of battles "Walhalla Rising."
What public would the Danish director Nicolas Waring Refn have thought of when he was rolling "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and uproot his enemies the guts of their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it's actually called, doesn't say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by at least one or two phrases or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying monstrous landscapes of Scotland, which the scenes offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown filmmakers and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a shame that they cannot rule out each other.
Director Waring Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the "Pusher" drug-trafficking hairstyle as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all the public with more humor in the main current or less of the brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and rib that sprout cannot deter most of the followers of art cinema.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretive reasons and becomes stuck an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and recloses there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of film is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the lucid trance sound band make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a young blonde, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, all others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eye hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to be angry, altered and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious movements of land
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new signs of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this matter until controls are allowed.
On the midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four F-15 I Israeli combat aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometres is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), dealing with a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with North Korea's help in the cube, hidden in a valley that leaves the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA in late April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the nearby Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique only serves other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the interior.
It was a short time since the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is just more known than at the time, the riddles became greater over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was fully sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the-Kibar, but that he saw little evidence that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "supposed reactor," although they consider the presentation of the CIA "plausible."
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor ahead of it, a senior UN diplomat responded in the summer in a stoning way that the IAEA has "enough material to have questions."
The Syrians were very quickly rid of the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and raided the ground conscientiously.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium traces in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state from commercial vendors at the time of the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA submitted.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown client, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damaskus has refused to discuss this, as has the case with satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from a second inspection in the Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also has a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, acting Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not been successful since June 2008 and "gradually becomes a serious credibility problem for the authorities," as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, under the control of the IAEA, is finally pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams to be the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not so far made public what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they seem suspicious.
According to Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as an intern, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is possibly at or immediately next to a military base, Syria thus prohibits the entry of all three sites into IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to be afraid of a record that the US has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alert to the equipment thanks to warnings from the US secret service
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is moved between the three locations and the cube on the shore of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production."
But there is no "indication of sensitive activities," either uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium for the bombs should be separated later, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargo from the ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers it unlikely that the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its aptitude as a zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked her to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that Syrians made land movements in the three alleged suspicious sites and removed large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it barely helps to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that IAEA has used a few months to develop a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
In the meantime, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassure themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador, is fencing so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have had to establish the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the IAEA director, who is to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future," but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: this requires most of the IAEA's governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat thought, "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in the times of war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of her debut still unnamed.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnia and a Serbian.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for the agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women & apos; s associations have protested quickly, thus moving some days of planned shooting in Sarajevo to Hungary at the last moment.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
He is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on this gives the victims enough to tell about the script.
His organization in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, gave after a strip and loosen a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not quite clear why Jolie did not go in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, introduces herself with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and to give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film sounds quite different on the network: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and they meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian camp where she works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of rape falls in love with a torturer."
It's safe that Jolie's film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here.
This afternoon, it's finally good for the Irish again.
No trace of affliction
On the other hand, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans cry out of joy as they cross the high music, hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the Southern Republic Cork, because the players launch, and find, pingpong balls to the beer vessels from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong," and the winner's prize is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this staffalary drinking game and the discreet computer doesn't really make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, to distract himself from the question that's coming, what the future will hold.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a pull he got the work of his dreams as event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners's three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin is currently working as an IT consultant in Londrés.
Young people leave: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, the economic experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin are forecast.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there comes a migration wave comparable to the one that the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, now melancholy is spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly confusing for the young, well-trained Irish, for whom so far, everything is so far uphill.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are letters to the mass director of young migrants, who complain that "everything in Ireland is sinking."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it to a whole generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a gloomy future coming up because the government is only engaged in assembly and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
He notes how his colleagues go from some practices not reumnerated to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair that offers a service around the issue of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to run your career," says the manager.
On its website, photos of one boy surfing in Australia and another practicing snowboard in Canada appear.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it involves freedom and fun.
For half a year now, Sean O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something else.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction in Germany.
Now they're raising a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his country only rarely because he works overtime to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, since it's been a long time since he stepped on the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes for ice-cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens before the houses, at the entrance are parking large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent funded by a credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions," he says.
Are you afraid of failing credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears today.
"No one should be hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst that can happen, perhaps with it we feel for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last big economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let the future stand and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked for a couple of years in London and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend in New Zealand do well?
But these days there is one thing that is very disturbing you: the celebration of your 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
I'm afraid I can degenerate at a farewell party.
"Just, not too many emotions," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Fired, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies, continues to increase.
Crime is of greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows for a follow-up of changes in attitude in the region.
The results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively mood in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in various countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a small 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a large decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see figure 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably more than 25 per cent in 2001 (figure 3).
About 34 per cent stated that they trusted their country & apos; s Congress and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but significantly higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis is likely to be due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and that it has been reduced again this year, to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem your country faces (see figure 5).
About 31 per cent say that, either they or a close relative, he has been a victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: about 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
About 58 per cent agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared with 47 per cent last year.
It is interesting that 62% of those surveyed in Venezuela are of the same opinion (and 80% support private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by those surveyed in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela has such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Waste elections
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they were much worse off than the fears of foreigners who were trying to help the country to remount after its problems.
Votes were introduced in the ballot boxes, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the largest United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "relatively good elections in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said with caution that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and to his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The event is expected to take place in January.
Not all hope for the elections has yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request for the vote to be invalidated.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority states that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if he has any, has moved on to the second round.
In view of the fact that the cholera epidemic rashes the country and more than a million earthquake survivors continue to live in tents, a large abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they were not able to do so because of a lack of organization.
Some 250,000 identity documents, necessary to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors regard the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And as it has become clear, so do the Haitians themselves.
Moving from the tips to the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
However, that I can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following Kirchner's death as a result of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which one Member punched another in the face and other Members accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore be implemented next year, which will give the President an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1 per cent, but many private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of the trade unions, are close to 30 per cent.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, put pressure on the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now modernise these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials claim that they want to limit wage increases next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bond holders who had refused a prior forced debt restructuring that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchner always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is often the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the prelude to the cleaning of INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when her term of office ends, given that she no longer has her husband at her side.
If you do, you will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has become tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not you will, calmly, repudiate many of your husband's policies.
Half a hooray for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of those eligible, went on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what seems to be a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become an advocate of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the greatest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for a little while.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five municipal elections, he failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PDP), which has leaned for total independence from Taiwan, obtained almost 50% of all votes compared to 45% of KMT.
If it had been the presidential, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of his party's votes has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PDP tied with the KMT in the municipalities.
The elections saw the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with banners and light girls of dancing clothes.
The mysterious attempt to murder rigor was also not lacking.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the elections.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, injuring him and killing a bystander.
The funny thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the shooting affected the elections, spreading suspicion about the PDP and causing voters to lean for the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, the candidates spoke about public accommodation plans and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
The KMT therefore often avoids publicizing its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PDP also avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy towards China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing to do is to wait for the 2012 presidential election to happen.
In any case, the PDP has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PDP is working to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as a candidate for the PDP for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now your party is doing its best to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans to set up a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that the PDP candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to present the presidential.
Even without Mr. Chen being interceed, the PDP will have difficulty in choosing from among its potential candidates.
The KMT should also do an awareness test.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman claims that he will restructure his cabinet, as well as the local teams.
The large PDP samples suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already crossed."
Grammy Nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys' surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Revelation Artist.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the nomination gives what to think, but it respects the Grammys' rules according to which it must be an artist who has not taken out more than three albums to the market before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," was no doubt a great advance and, taking into account his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the road to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have recently concentrated on the jazz field for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity," an exciting and magnificent album that was one of the favorites last year.
Iyer's competitors include veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboard John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite strident in New Orleans and regular guest at the HBO's "Treme," was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which for the rest is heavily inclined towards the fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's wild punk got a well-deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the great camera jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways," was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Awards Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse," a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles," a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in 13 categories, including orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Symphonies No 3 and No 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony and Orchestra. "
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's # 4 Symphony premiered at the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by La-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" by Dorman is nominated for the instrumental soloist performance with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to be played in mandolin Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Ensemble Metropolis.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a phone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the category of orchestra function, for leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
The nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and archer Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, the soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque proposed in Temecula obtained the approval of the Organ Commission
The project of a mosque for Temecula has received unanimous support from the local law enforcement commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying it promotes terrorism and jams.
However, the members of the committee decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from the aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or Baha'is, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud of it."
"Prove that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loud."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6: 00 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who intercede for or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"America no longer exists," read in one of the comments.
"It's another Apes Planet with Mrs. Freedom dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The plans for the construction of Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, including near area zero, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 took place.
In the Valley of Temecula, the magnet Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a greater and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High.
The opponents can still appeal the project to the Municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbium poses the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients increases the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it a very peculiar thing, although it is not enough to be a really 'alien' type of way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the Thursday online edition of the Science publication.
For a long time, there are six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you think about what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
As Anbar said, finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, as researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbium discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great deal of speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there may be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of" standard "elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the investigation team.
"This work is novel because it shows the replacement of one element by another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," added Cockell.
The discovery was not by chance made.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on the Lake Monkey because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbium exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it may be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough to not work as well as phosphorus, so it goes in and, to put it some way, appeals to biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbium grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic in its place raises the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic can naturally exist, whether in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new, but an example had never been found to prove that it worked.
The arsenic was more common in the first ages of the Earth, he said, so the researchers speculated that the first forms of life may have used it.
"It does suggest that there might be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth earlier," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
Stolen dogs missing in Compton have been found
The two missing dogs of the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel have been found, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found on Wednesday, late evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff's department.
"The good news is that dogs are all right," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They have returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't mean anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make any comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not been damaged.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to show at the local competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to be shown in other competitions scheduled for the days before the AKC / Eukanuba championship, as Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's almost two-month tour participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard made the check-in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of your room window.
They were carrying three other dogs (a boxer's kid, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van's robbery on Tuesday at 6: 00 in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to clear approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television programs.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the American bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM relegating under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The process of restructuring the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management needed to manage its finances, while fighting to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in the recovery of bankrupt companies, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the more than 140 creditors in the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted a few bidders and none of them willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially gets out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies will receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $375,000 per month for their company management services, will receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production in MGM, which released only one film this year, and gathered an annual board of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to make a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of your budget for gifts
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy of this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant mella in their gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes of 99 dollars each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings adorned with beads, or approximately 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Law has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, cost the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button-powered toys are increasing, as are the toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are teddy toys the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when their barrigas are tightened.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze begins to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For dance-combined singing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
By borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift change games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of letters of questions designed to convert a car ride into a session with a notebook of occurring self-correction exercises.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smartphone, here you will have three independent alternatives.
VTech's moving ($60, 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years), it is the first important setting of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-type system to present games and e-books, and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a set of five blocks just larger than a match box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to set up words by putting the blocks in line before the time is over; it is formidable for an improvised competition of word-arming.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in playshops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6-12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of microbots driven by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It's also lasting.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance in China is promoted
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the way in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the chengguan women's members, the corpulent police of China's urban order, feared and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Signatures!"
"Attention!"
"Show them," he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls who barely spent their teens with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention to.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on top of the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr Tang, disdainly.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to clear the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a decicolon snack cart, and watched it with a frowning frown constantly for half an hour, until the street seller picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the clumsy police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's meticulous respect for these city squads.
And for a good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city ordinances by imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province beat to death a bystander after using his cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it was described as effectively beating criminals without bleeding them.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street salesman suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for online download, presents Chinese-trained inspectors who attack street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar in the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
The skeptics say that the current approach is far from it.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial at The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's warning called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features."
They should have a height above the average, more than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Withdrawal at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said that the work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
The female chengguan are like vases, he said, and added, "besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not anxious to support that description.
But he noted that the demands of height were standard in many Chinese job notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it's a matter of debate between the Chinese.
The disabled or disfigured must surely not be present.
"We cannot allow a person to take or a hunchback to come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colorful cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old co-worker, Xu Yang, said, "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also don't object to their work on a fixed time, they said, because they enjoy career ambitions greater than just hustling vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to limit their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces about a dozen street vendors on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many bread or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman was walking away, temporarily leaving his bike-thrown car with noodle garrison.
The officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, mutated after the false rumor that some Chengguan officers had killed a seller was spread.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were turned over or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has prevented such violence.
But calm is barely guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where women's officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike was grumpy.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their way to their vehicles and went quickly with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white insignia turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, the coordinators, men 40 years of age or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total nature.
"Most of the time it's the public that starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign
The senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that the Department of Justice's prosecutors have exculpated Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobby for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal about his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he was "certainly happy" with the decision, which came after an entire year's investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an object of his investigation and that he has no plan to press charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobby.
The interviews, e-mail and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as the treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's work and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law of lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
The ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, was in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbing ban," which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the status of revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending government-investigated clients.
While Department of Justice officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks to its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop the trial against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of procedural misconduct charges.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's main lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a D.A. 's attorney on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with the prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable getting into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which claims that a $96,000 payment from Ensign's parents to the Hampton violated federal electoral law.
The election commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing but a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through lobby thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "beating" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When for the first time the news of the affair last year appeared, Ensign asked his constituents for forgiveness and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and complete its investigation.
"Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the court room.
Minute a minute, they sent reports of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the death penalty judge voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed writings in court that outline the arguments for appeals that will probably be before the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the extensive use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere," and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details made public passions an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force the judges of appeal to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the court room.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the court room is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defence lawyer for Mr. Hayes.
First-instance judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconically rejected the claims in a ruling last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was led by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of appeal have recognized that the coverage of successful cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a historic ruling of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard v. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts that examined Mr. Hayes's conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be necessary to control the form of communication from the court rooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of the new media" in high-profile processes, "said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from court chambers could make trials more fair.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many of the issues raised by Hayes' lawyers, who will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some jurors have said that they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and his daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continuously threw wood into the fire of emotion over the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "it was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in the whole state."
Your attention to Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly was a ludicrous vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal were often attracted to the arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In his writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would demand that new means would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can the civism set up a bridge to join the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invectiva and negativity, this week a little civic has been triggered in Washington.
Is it an omen of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to party combat in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not lead to any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a courteous discussion of the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to rule, rather than being another empty episode to win party points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the president's deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcended the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is just enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Now both sides are in a probationary period, raging at each other to identify signs of cooperation and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
The reason why the Tuesday meeting and the subsequent assessments of the meeting by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and very deep-rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that existed over the past two years.
Whether it is tax, expenditure, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has soften the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections wake up party passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good. "
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions are over at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, on a permanent or temporary basis.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make them believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to a continuous bipartisan when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, that a period of disagreement should begin.
"After the things to be done are done, in the short term psychology will turn the situation back to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that the civism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of overreacting to their position, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut state expenditures and override the new health law.
These partisan lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the reduction of expenditure.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forced the question of the public agenda deficit in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they've been fighting to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected on the panel, suggesting that there are at least few grounds or desire for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House Republicans and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of party clashes, when the Republicans challenge Obama over the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of more two-party cooperation.
What would bring about change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the party of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the reaction of the people.
Whoever they think is losing will probably change course and seek engagement.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partidism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans of the Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points on the issues that still divide them.
A filtered American document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracy," and leaves a part of the bribes and protection money that the Kremlin collects directly, as reported in February by the US Embassy in Russia.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority," takes his part as the money goes up on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a clean-up since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel claims about such allegations.
In September, when he was asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested that he was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, a scumbag, a nuisance."
According to the polls, the Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to say that the government functions more like a cleptocracy than a government," the note says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means" roof "or protection) that is passed through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all the sectors of the Moscow City government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in the Moscow criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from the largest companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, "explained that Moscow's commercial owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while money collection is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don't pay quickly find their business closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that it has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking bags, probably full of cash, inside Kremlin himself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem group of experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked at 154 (countries are classified at least at the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US Embassy note, which did not occur until late in the night Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to face the past
In a specific room with a slightly illuminated, stained and deranged walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Jemeres Rojos Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer-Red government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer-Red fortress in the north-west of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Red surrendered to the government, the long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly face people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Roojos to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations / Cambodia court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Khmer Rojos, sentencing the former head of the well-known torture centre Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Khmer Rojos of Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rojos, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Reds was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or killed of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government, the regime's remains and its military fled to the Cambodia-Thailand border.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and forests of Western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer-Red fighters began deserting to the government, culminating in the renditions of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting the trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the most ancient Khmer Red fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Jemeres Rojos officers retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the soldiers are still poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have had little benefit after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Justice and Reconciliation Centre, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rojos when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rojos was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-supply."
The current Khmer Red Court has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court is expected to start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This was not much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district head in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer-Red government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had monitored the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent shady afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his house on wooden pilotes on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rooks.
She stated that if the court called her, she would not be present.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Red, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea," of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rojos.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer-Red, despite the city's link to the regime.
19-year-old Valeak, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
In any case, here the Khmer Reds retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black soot covered by a rusty roof of tin.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tires after his death in 1998.
Noom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the edge of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many local inhabitants go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last break, where he would leave a bunch of mature bananas in the hope of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its weapons-qualified uranium reserve
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarus government announced Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-qualified uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to a staff member, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-qualified uranium) and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not gonna make dirty bombs, and we're not gonna sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials stated that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The US government spent $13 million for the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of low-enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies this year estimated that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of weapons-qualified uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's rough repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential distension.
It was stated that "while the progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not make any changes to the CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not make any corrections to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading for Guantánamo through Spanish territory, as the US ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, where it is added that the then First Vice President of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft that pass through Spain."
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in anti-human rights practices, a meeting took place between former United States Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "caught unprepared," says Aguirre on a cable.
The then Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity to influence."
For his part, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to request the disqualification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors," rather than the disclassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," says Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although Spanish judges are rabiously jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the action of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government," he says.
The parricida confesa complained in the network of the "agony" of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he used since he was a child, he communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natural people of Noia, the Coruñés people of which she is a native.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC rebuilds through testimonies of his family.
The young Galician, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrial.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, it was soon known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him have the DNA test.
He didn't have time to meet another date.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long period.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to check the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance was broken, that they broke.
In March 2008, he is in Menorca alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and bruised, because I have come to work."
"When I told him, he was fine, but of course, he now realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not be free to do whatever he wants."
Then talk about a phone message you just received: "I want you to turn this month or give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains, "If you don't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back," she claims.
In May, he talks about the return to his village: "I'm going there this week, but I'll only be there until 19, because the 20 I have to run for a job so I don't lose it."
He explains that if everything goes well with him, he takes his firstborn.
"He's going to be with who he should, that is, with me, and never in life will I think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother," doubtful intention given his bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on 1 of that month, and was allegedly killed on 10, is supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He will go there (the child) to some summer classes, and thus save me some kangaroo pasta."
On the 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, look how he wants to find me, you have to fuck off."
The 30, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one, "He's giving me money."
On the Internet there are messages from her on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now in intervention, where he called himself "Muki the Exprisoner."
"Terror to the Galician (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, a jury guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything happened because he didn't tell him that he was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the Menorca judicial detention centre.
The public prosecutor, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "nor had he intended to cause any harm to the minor."
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and placed his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the view set in the general elections, since, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections usually doubles the one it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics, the figure was 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CFP won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been nurtured by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people, ERC would lose one Member - now he has three - while ICV would stay with one Member or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the most immediate meeting will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relief to the head of the Barcelona City Council, one of the most budget administrations - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority or the possibility to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be crazy if this formation lost its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes -.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to be able to take the lead in the Tarraconense capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only located 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found themselves on several occasions.
People have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three detainees in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by officers of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that the "operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaida's forgery apparatus at the international level and therefore "its operational capacity."
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the Al Qaida criminal galaxy so that their "combatants" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with complete impunity.
The outsourced cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had in operation in Europe, hence other European police units have been involved in the investigations in addition to the Thai services, so it is not ruled out that in the next few days, similar blows are carried out in the EU territory that were carried out on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), in Thailand another was carried out with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who led the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was beaten in 2009 - was mainly stealing from tourists passports that met the requirements of the so-called "World Islamic Front."
In other words, the documents should be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the media of the investigation, it is emphasized that, for the moment, no data has been found that links those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," has been one of the groups receiving the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized a lot of documentation.
The PP demands Mas to stop the tax concert
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas to her conditions to support her investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which is summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispensing with philo-sovereign adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to put forward in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the security that has obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make her want, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investiture vote.
The future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but for the time being, the talks that Mas has with the other political leaders are made in Catalan.
As for the President of the PP, in order to support an investiture, "all the sovereign and independent discourses must be reserved," as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends to even submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to thwarting the political apparatus of a very inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Mas will be dealt with by the CFP, Jordi Cornet and Dolores Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their guardian killed more than 11 elderly people.
The officers of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who was employed there killed at least 11 elderly people in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by counsel from the centre, Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to charge the person responsible" for the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials."
In addition to the social disprestige that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the warden in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation already being calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' relatives.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has since not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was carried out by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, strongly denied this end yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the case there is no single indication that there has been an reckless action on the part of any other person other than the accused."
He already named "Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, one and a half months later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he was killed by an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to the medicines.
The insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail were reportedly the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the tests that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Vila does not lie and seeks for her first victims a less cruel death or whether, on the contrary, she has abrassed them inside giving them bleach as she has already confessed to her with the three women she killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not give credibility to the cellars' demonstrations, even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that they are superior, and they justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after he has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is threatening
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that he warned "markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
Peripheral differentials have been tightly closed and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to be wrong, and the euro has hardly repointed, which is a worrying sign.
What has taken place yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it is plumped is recovered but caused by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan for inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary long-term liquidity measures, leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis we hope that they will extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that you will continue your bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be inclined to withdraw liquidity measures, God help us!
As at their May meeting where they stated that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazuca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Yesterday the one-year letter auction in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
However, the rates in Portugal fell 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the numbers of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Help Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have sufficient support, and Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech in order to relax the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December at which a political commitment is necessary to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European stock markets.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been rapid and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope that it will be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Help Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available three times that in March, at very expensive rates and it closes you access to the sine die markets.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, to look like it."
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the meeting of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The temporary does not amaine in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Anebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, by considering it "null and void" the judicial board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and to take over the management bodies of the holder firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to give in to its litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was disbanded by five of his seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose challenge is noted in the Trade Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the judge of the Comercial No. 2 of Madrid, has again opened the box of thunder within the family Alvarez.
The use of the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal of the applicants his five children to, through procedural argument, in clear fraud of law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null board of 18 January," according to their official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for a challenge to be made once the meeting has been held, in that it is considered to be "null and void."
The same protagonists, who remain silent, have already tried unsuccessfully for the judge to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a property society and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the matter of substance to be decided by the judge after the hearing of the request for a challenge, for which there is not yet a specified date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software designs real-time car improvements.
Since Red Bull broke into the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select speed universe has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived squire and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship, they all bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without undermining the ability as a pilot of the finally champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far away from high car competition.
Nominated PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable failures and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's photographic cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time," the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that the spares in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 high-skilled young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and project all kinds of changes in the bollids.
Siemens' manager explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull's bollids with the exception of the engine, which is of Renault's full responsibility.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be carried from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser and high-tech autokey production systems.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement, there is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its bollids in a location about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The staff for this task amount to 580 people, including their two pilots, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 of Red Bull, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists are hidden whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety null.
The factory's head of technology, Steve Nevey, claims that five years ago it was possible to say that R & D advances in wagon cars contributed 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer, as they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install 20 own shops with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive shop in collaboration are its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice president, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the remodeled shop located in the Gran Vía Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been working for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open was Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems said that the philosophy to install the shops will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and is responsible for the design of the exclusive furniture of the shops (with products that can be played in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sale and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-wide pioneering pilot program that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP software in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies already have technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell wager to 'steal' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other managers, Banco Sabadell's CEO, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and wakes the end of the liability war.
However, it provides for a collapse of the interest margins, which will be attempted to compensate in part for increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to capture in three years one million private customers, his outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years in order to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new management plan, which will be in effect for three years.
The aim, in addition to surviving without the need for public aid from the FROB, is to gain a market share with the collection of a million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted - their large outstanding subject, as it has so far spoiled SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
The market share in private individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it is more than 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as a target, and whose challenges will be presented by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare at this time to set targets and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world's banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year's Optima master plan, set four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the market situation made it expand one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main target.
In a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the end of the crisis in Spain will "be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, while he believes that the liability war - which the Marks penalize - is being reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and banks are paying for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already moving to the credit price to compensate for the fall of the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We have not closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto already gave his network orders on Thursday to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials - see CincoDias on the 22nd and 27th of November.
He also recognized that the banking trend now "is to raise commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he claims that in Spain "larger sizes are going to be required."
"Next year is going to move everything," he said.
He claims that capital needs are "much higher" and does not rule out any Spanish financial institution entering into red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalisation.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he subtracted the importance of what some bankers have already seen as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repos, which amortizes the crisis.
ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the banks
The ECSC Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out a wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When it started the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks, several entities ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Cajas de Ahorros (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled yesterday that this new wave of operations will take place.
"I think the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Civic Banking cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; we may go to 13 or 14 instead of 17, but all the great processes have already been done and protected by the Banco de España, which has also been very helpful in that," the director said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Aragon Directors and Executives (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the process of concentration is being undertaken "at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is taking place in the time periods that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco de España," he emphasized.
"Moving from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volume to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much larger to meet Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta recognized that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slow pace of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and sense," because "what the Banco de España does is to remember that we have to be within the time frame before the end of the year."
The ECSC Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who call it into question.
The manager said that, in the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "goes as fast as possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies for the placement or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of the Foreign Minister Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How do we interpret these movements?
Go ahead, Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new view of what its future must be, which is in conflict with that of maintaining the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third is a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries that are in breach, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government took a constitutional reform out of hand to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (fiscal rigour and stability plans in public finances), and what was being done by its European partners, including France.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel pitifully extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and the published opinion were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, to make it possible to rescue a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run on part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But your proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should be in the process of reforming the Union, which will make it possible to do so from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which he may not agree very much, from that date the old operation of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the wrongdoing countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves suspended and, in that case, the private sector will also be at part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high rates of savings and investment, moderation of consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, simply will not tolerate it.
The send is clear.
And we would do wrong not to understand.
It is not just about redriving the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will make way for greater peace.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity that you have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put at home has been opened.
But the red line Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are envisaged, that of leaving a monetary area too stalled from unserious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sports and law fraud
Traps like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax show ingenuity but no will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether or not such behaviour is anti-sports and whether, eventually, both players should be punished by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which your team already had clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time to take out misdemeanors to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction of the next match of the league, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches, and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or the like is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the related case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem presupposes nobility and honor, and that in the past has fined its players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to its long history of histrionic and provocative technique.
In any case, the debate is about whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these actions commit fraud of law; they are, in fact, actions that are respectful of the sports regulation, but seem to be circumventing its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the goods that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put at risk, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is referred to with fair play is to prevent the team of the violators from taking unfair advantage of the opposite team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradoxical thing about the action of the Real Madrid players is that they did not fit into what we normally characterized as a trap or law fraud, because their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the punishment, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They were waiting and happy to accept the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders get in the intentional misdemeanours examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not placed in a disadvantageous position and no benefit is obtained in the same party, as the result of the action clearly means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can be eliminated at the first of change, and with this performance the players perform a penalty match and move to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by card accumulation occurs with a less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions do not go against the sports spirit, of which it is part of making strategic decisions that favour making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case in question, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because they were two self-expulsions and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offering Offering to capture the Christmas dinners of groups in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th days.
The self-paid celebrations of employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, are proliferating.
Like the turron and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners prior to Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed agree.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (as the New Year's Eve fell on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for high-end days (16 and 17) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the slender cow stage began, many companies have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to dispense with tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, the president of the Gremi de Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to awaken what the festivities of this month will be like.
"People think about it long before they book."
"He wants to go out, but he has the alerts on the price issue," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to step down a step with the crisis, so that the strip around the 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A survey in various central establishments shows the collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
In the group Solas indicate that there is a real boom of applications for that Friday, with the intention to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the circumstances, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
In AN Grup, which abounds El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 premises, they remain optimistic after detecting a billing boom from the second semester and a good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who precelebrate the parties.
To its six group menus have added a Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green buds in some companies that reinvite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure), its vice president, Enric Gomà, hopes to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall the reservations are "encouraged," although the customers "negotiate to the maximum."
That's right, the illusion of the festivities has not come down, the one who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program gives rise to great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks' leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program aroused in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of attack - is one of the main reasons for the detachment in Washington.
This is listed by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep the guard.
"Pakistan has had to recruit staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their American counterparts.
The most novel of the documentation leaked by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-smaller cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating," says: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers are either unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
To the hunt for the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to avoid further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it's not about the last leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but about the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer for the Wikileaks creator, Mark Stephens, claims that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was on the 20th that the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after being authorized by the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization has explained, do consider the so-called free notice network to proceed to an arrest -- which must be committed by the national police corps -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has shown willingness to respond by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the mythical Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal chase," the missiva denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday he granted an interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was denoted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking counter-terrorism leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to subtract Assange's importance contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house in January, has asked the State Department to consider the possibility of including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and to pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or help."
Even further has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying that Assange should "be killed."
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever leaked the information in the government is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he said in the Fox chain.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to those close to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the hundredth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, with no north for the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation amago is insufficient for those close to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is as diluted today as his own mentor and that it can at all cause him the head breakers he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the Esquerra leader will try to beat the new critics with winks that will allow them to be armored until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on their continuity in secret.
By ballot, not by hand.
If the carodists want a certain vote of punishment for the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of subjection to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without specifying percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
Those close to Carod require the president more than to put his office at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But by not having the majority enough to force resignation, they're going to try to agree with the executive a road map by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document which the management will put to the vote by the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the fact that he promises to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something that the dome already takes for granted.
The leader of the ERC recognized that "polyphony" harms stability and that its aim is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty doors inside.
In this line, the article that the acting conseller Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the headline of Innovació assumed that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives."
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "reclaim" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC should at once liquidate assembly as a mechanism of operation.
He therefore called for a reform of the statutes that would allow the congresses to be held through elected delegates.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave conclave of 2008 left the task to the management to review the assembly at a specific congress for the reform of the statutes.
This quote is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years did not advise to deal with the matter.
Now, without sectors critical of stalking, it can be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are that of three women and the finding of a couple of bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, they amount to 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the case of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of a firearm and the shot of grace in the head as well as his feet and hands tied with cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixteces Street, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
On the morning of Thursday four, ejidatarios found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal quota highway, in the section that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
A message signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana was found next to the body.
A day later in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old man, he was killed with eight bullets after leaving his house to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were completed with a bullet impact on the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace on the front, a man's body was found on a lonely road to El Naranjo Colonia and under the body they found a 25-caliber percusted gun shell.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán warned about the finding of a body in the Peña Colorada area, which was tied from the hands back and with the head blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and left in the trunk of a vehicle in streets of the Fractionación Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, together with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incordible.
On 17, wrapped in blankets, two women were found lifeless in the town of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man in Huixquiluan was located, which was wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, allegedly identified by the name of Mario Ríos according to a message that his executors left with him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshot in the back of the head, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
In the woman's skin, tattoos of the Holy Death were detected, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, a man's body was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with a head attached and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who do not line up."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied by feet and hands, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancon colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and with a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him, the agents found a card with a message.
Maintains China's greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country had made great efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supported its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16 Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, his country had invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that regard.
He said that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and support to pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Act, which sets out the objectives for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities to achieve the objectives of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, a number of multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are in progress or have already been completed.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the change of incandescent sources for savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, said that China's efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, he stated that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the past five years and plans to do so by the year 2020, it abound.
Taken to the legality of the expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was bound to the legality and that the former leader of the PAN is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagua's protest as state governor, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision made at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order of Sonora Committee."
"Mr Espino has the right, if any, to appeal to the National Council's Order Committee, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, when his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a theme that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; the counter" we enjoy it and strengthen us, "he said.
He said that the council will no doubt be able to choose the best or best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, so he will deliver the "to whom the council determines" scam.
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, to either of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the party's rebound in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next contest, although "this is not the time to think in 2012."
"For now it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the reason for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longs are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations."
When he was questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the framework of his four years of government, César Nava called on the priists to reflect on the sexennia of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, that they should start defending them; that they should leave the closet," he said.
He felt that the head of the federal executive could make expressions like he did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there was no gag or much less censorship in the country.
Promotes Obama on Twitter Law for Undocumented Students
"If you agree that approving the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and encourage them to pass this legislation," the president tweeted to the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and encourage them to pass this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps a cyberlink open with a broader document that asks the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs was confident that once the fiscal issue has been resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects can be set.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the tax matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point at that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a "debate vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize some 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and entered an institution of higher education or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, so they require the competition of a handful of Republicans, at a time when party organizations of the project are playing an intense role in lobbying to ensure the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said that he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
For this reason, the supporters of the Dream Act require the addition of several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but have stated that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the wound
The second round of "The pleasures of the tongue" was a walk where the participants showed the story
"I understand that about sex in the language, but... the finger in the sore? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table was devoted to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound... "puts us in trouble," the Argentine writer sweetly presented to the public, most of whom were young, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to hear this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "laga" is, goes from doctor to doctor, of which he does not get answers, although he does get clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist he is convinced: "Patience is not my strong, perhaps it is my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hall, but who clarifies that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very interverted.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delicious narrative that Elogio titled of invention, where the finger in the wound is not named but at a time is discovered.
With the brushes of magic realism, he tells of a famous sorcerer, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a maiden would have lost, a story that he turned to speak later America, the great novel to which his own chronists told it from the beginning, and quoted Bernal Díaz of the Castle who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made mockery of the faked witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told with imagination that was lacking to the modesty."
However, he stressed "it is the crazy and the scoundrel who best imagine" and it is where reality and lie converts, where it is no longer known that the story belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
It is called the "Cervantine tradition '.
"By his inheritance we are what is told."
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger on the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican woman pointed her to the great scourge of social violence that her country - and she shares Latin America - is the result of drug trafficking and sale disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs embody a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the hurt of the writer's committed."
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To own our thought and to own reality, we have to nuke: and nuisance often means to put the finger on the wound and to annoy those people who are much more comfortable thinking of caricature, black and white, in established and unnuanced ideas, and also to nuisance the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting them to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Ruben Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series three times, although so far it has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoling with the subchamp's medal, has stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive endings.
The sanctist strategist came to his first final as coach at the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he carried the reins of the Morelia with which he fell by global of 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the 2003 Clausura he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with global of 3-1 and went precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, at the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again in front of the Demons, Ruben again suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied 2-2 in front of the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the pénaltis strip he took advantage of 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players of his failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 volterette.
Ruben has already lost two finals with the Red Demons and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to run the same fate, he seeks to get rid of the evil and to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that the most important thing for him is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and therefore the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the timonel when he was questioned about the numbers he has against playing endings.
Very effective has the previous end, of which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in line, the players too, because the previous time, with two criminals to throw we were already ready to run and I think that's a teaching, until the party is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shooting, something that does not concern you, because you trust your players: "You never seek to get to the range of penthouses, you seek to end up in regular time, but sometimes you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately you made a bad move to us fate, sometimes because of the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in your hands, but you left us, that left us something for this end that we hope does not reach that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a subchampion technician and to try for the first time the glory given by the titles.
EU changes rules to obtain visa
Persons must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview with the Consular Section.
The ASC staff shall take the applicant's biometric information, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer required to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another payment for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their prints.
Because biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than in the past.
Also, those who apply for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

Announce NASA finding alien life
The American space agency summoned the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will make known tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is an alien life.
The find will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13: 00 at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA stated that it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for alien life," which led to speculations by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures together with us and in hostile environments that felt uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they will become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbium that was found at the bottom of the Lake Monkey in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will make known the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference Thursday.
The conference will be attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the greatest moon of Saturn), in the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and opposition 'block' pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisan', they denounce.
The 60 Legislastura was not installed when an opposition bloc, headed by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, was emerging in Congress, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisan' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it is the beginning of the 'bipartisan', because now there will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in their capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that these reforms are the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He noted that in the next few days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to change the scheme, based on a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be reavowed by both parties and with that end the opposition coalition.
"So far it came (the opposition coalition), that is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, nor do they even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolic, is now "duopolic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipatidism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other partners to make them more, the convergent abound.
Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress now became a 'booty' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now it's being shared between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the Member, to be given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let not by cumular agreements be left out to 5 that we will probably make 9 Members, now to the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to find a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
They're going out $200,000 more for "the supplier."
He pays Mazatlán City Council another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
One more check for just over 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the company of electrical material, is 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "settlement of accounts payable."
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you are simply being paid what you owe, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Act makes when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using their services, the Treasurer said that they have not reused their services.
The above, after that on July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the City Council over 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to attend tourist sites
They regret tourist entrepreneurs accident the foreign tourist for poor conditions of the Sánchez Taboada Glorieta in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Golden Zone Trade Association, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and to reverse how bad tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor state of the streets and the banquettes has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and turn him around to nearby business.
"Politicians do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or otherwise they do not do the works in this way in so long and without proper planning."
The hotel member José Ramón Mangart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the City Council's lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, thus providing preventive maintenance and not just falling into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city good."
There are other places that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Venate of Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has clean on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"No due attention has been given and this kind of fact shows something that is notorious to all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Assistant Secretary for Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of Mazatlán tourist sites is urgent, as they are not properly exploited and they project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places to be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put on line to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility to be an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A decent work legislature free of agreements between parties and the State Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature, composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 members of the PAN, three members of the New Alliance Party, two members of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one of the PVEM, has been established, bringing together a total of 40 people's representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they will come to make a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that do not repeat the same patterns of partism or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress take the great responsibility to be an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become a shared carnival of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
He therefore spoke of their certification of the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that will bring forward the governor in turn.
"We are busy that they will come to do a decent job and, above all, committed to society and the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Mangart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotels Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage job generation."
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he has within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretary.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruent as an important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition to the need to label resources to trigger tourism projects that help to secure the state and update the Alcohol Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
He's looking for a wizard king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For his parents, the next Kings Day will be difficult to please his illusions, as his home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a scapegoat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so want.
The family lives in a humble house in the Colonia Salvador Allende and live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Well, sometimes we see it hard because my husband has no shamba, but we sell mandarin and dad... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bike, while her 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'let's see son', because he was very expensive," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, those who were in school, clothes and footwear would be ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Michael, 8, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, lacks tennis, so a couple of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela come true you can participate in the campaign "Find a Wizard King," donating a toy or cash at the reception in Northwest.
Fourteen alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out as part of the dismantling of a network for the production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face a number of charges.
Persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"About 750 Cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Québec Security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice within hours of their arrest.
They could face the allegations of Cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, plot and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests," says Mr Ruel.
This police operation involved about seventy officers from the Estrie de la Seguridad del Quebec investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
Action to combat clandestine migration could be taken without any problems.
The Conservatives & apos; Bill which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of smuggled migrants & apos; passports, would surely face a great deal of opposition, since the three opposition parties had announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I'm based mainly on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created the granite you step on," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the deputies after the weekly meeting of the cucus.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow for the arrest of up to one year any person from a ship identified as the transport of clandestine immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Québec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against and all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected from a stroke the criticism that his party is not firm enough with clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of the underground couples, and that is what we are trying to do with another bill, the C-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' Bill because it attacks refugees and embodies children for a minimum of one year," explains Mrs Chow.
The Immigration Minister, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and of ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell Members that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as a fellate."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," says Minister Kenney.
The Government had not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservator has informed the QMI Agency that the Government would request a vote so that every Member who is to oppose it will later explain to its constituents.
New unity does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports the fact that this idea has not been put forward two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
The Tuesday announcement has therefore caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Québec Police Services held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebequense party dealing with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a rabbit out of the gossip" and "a last-minute blunder."
Minister Dutile, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on possible future unity.
"You will see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest is obstinate in avoiding the creation of this committee of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the general intervener to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general controller," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the financial controller the same powers as a Commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent crew is not the only ongoing project in the Charent Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed, for his part, that his counterpart for Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to the groups of bikers, even if the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to the heavy rainfall that has occurred in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, a number of regions recorded severe rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
In addition, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located to the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these rainfall is in addition to the snow thawing that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will deborate.
On Wednesday night, Quebec's civil security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a provisional bridge.
As a preventive measure, 10 residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefrast.
The civilian security unit continues to monitor and monitor the situation closely, as indicated by the security adviser, Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Québec Flowland Forecasting Centre issued ads communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partly blame Dupont
Quebec's radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Radio Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and on Haitians, as well as for their rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in the broadcasts spread during the day."
The Council also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made in broadcasts issued between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the common front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must report reliable data rather than misleading data.
In relation to suicide, the present Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most Committee members have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes called into question by" Dupont le midi "have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any guilt has been rejected in this regard.
The last dispute concerned the statements made following the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had led to a media confrontation that had caused numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy would really receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "even more than required."
The consequences shall be minimal for the station, which shall, inter alia, announce the decisions once in the hours of the largest hearing within three days.
A king of the kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealés Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and Thai box, goes up to the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek fighting everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground that involves the mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur World Championship, held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of full kickboxing contact and Thai box," he explained.
"I'm currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite the athletes who have finished among the first four positions in the world's last championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I completed the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I have made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first one this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating from China in which it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as to throw the adversaries to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only maintain a competition in his career, he will no doubt go to the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the nice boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It's been an amazing experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who has won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category are faced to crown a single champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the centre of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium made up of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior invitation to tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public invitation to tender.
For the Quebequense Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause price increases.
"This is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition."
"I mean, people, rather than secretly, now do it openly," said Québec Party Member Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can benefit in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collusion with this contract.
"I'm beginning to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" and "unrigour."
He pointed out that "the least" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been granted without competition being involved; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortia formula has no longer been the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortia 'formula in the technical advice sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Québec's commercial record allows to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labour dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can come into contact with the actors in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory and well-priced agreement."
"The idea, however, is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract granted to the Energie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebequense Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in Énergie gérance.
All the contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energie gérance contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance it," before specifying that it is rather its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecologically, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebecense consumer hardly relies on the actors of sustainable development, as well as on fair trade marks and on ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where they pollute messages that defend more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even hinders its commitment.
Even if the consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebequenses seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of the companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measuring tool developed by the Observatory of the consumption responsible of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that carry the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsible," the Barometer points out.
In the same way, only 14.6% of the Quebequenses take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, which is currently supported by about one third of the Quebequan consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the dubious nature of information cause 46% of consumers to discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of the Quebechs also say they are distrust of the alleged yields of the ecological products or services that they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in the shops in their neighborhood and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points on a maximum of 100 this year), the Québec's Homo consumus loves to occupy the post of the recycling king who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by caring for the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social consciousness seems to be from doors (from your car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of the Quebechs indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1 per cent of the participants in this extensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of the bike and the walking trips.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris pos la Société Angus and the Parallèle cinemas complex, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who were waiting for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy back Daniel Langlois' eXcentris film complex in the Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return his true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they asked.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, the amount of which would in fact be less than the initial expectations; this could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and an application of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation should be completely discarded.
Let us remember that the Association of the owners of cinemas and film complexes of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, as it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector do call for considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has for ten years carried the burden of the author's film on his premises, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent film rooms is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to trust their clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are promoting a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open the way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, just one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to project films on eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms next February 27, projecting Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux."
However, Christian Yaccarini has not recontacted Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadians' complex with respect to the Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter's feeling of superiority towards Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-United States relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy of Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A September 22, 2008 cable, that is, during the full federal election campaign, reports how far the United States does not come into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex almost inherent to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed by the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will first record a deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion," says Mr Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image of the dramatic series broadcast in the United States CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which makes unsubtle references to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappings for the CIA to carry out strong interrogations.
Another cable says that, during its first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner replied that he did, but that he was "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the mood has been heated in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass escape should be "killed."
In the United States, they echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN in Cancún proposed a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) by almost one third of the additional decrease to be made to stabilize the climate of the planet by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent light bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were to be replaced by fluocompact light bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode (DEL or "LED") bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should still be reduced to stabilize, by 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy spending is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, energy consumption is still reduced twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to give us an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan to be implemented in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reostates and emit very little heat.
Above, they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have expressed their reservations regarding fluocompact light bulbs, as they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact light bulbs, but the coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is dumped with incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results immediately," a spokesman for the head of the UN highlights.
"Calls on all the parties in Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left the deadline for Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday's scrutiny.
About 40 minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CIS had told the television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the demands for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have increased.
However, the Gbagbo side has the Constitutional Council's annulment of "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the new forces (FN) since the failed coup d & apos; état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Côte d'Ivoire, said that the intimidation exercises of the voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing President from voting.
The whole election could be quashed if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of Gbagbo consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in the publication of the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the glove on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations has warned the Ivory Coast political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the temporary seasonal variations (EQs) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population on the mainland and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available within two weeks to work and seek or not to work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+ 0.9 points in three months, + 0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of ILO.
In addition, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+ 0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, up to 6.6% with the MDO.
There has only been a stability of unemployment among people aged 25 to 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, + 0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all France.
The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOMs) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, as his lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions that the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, had told AFP before the appearance of his client.
Mr. Guérini, the brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their nearby people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all your client has done has been to deal with the landfills you must manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their implementation, he was not aware of the matter, according to counsel Simon.
In the context of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, has also been under investigation since Wednesday for embezzlement of funds and complicity, but he has been released on parole and has been prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating judge has taken the explanations into account and has released him," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged for "influence trafficking and passive corruption."
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "the removal and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to the public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds," respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "cover-up of the abuse of social property."
Among the people who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have served to whiten the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that research is particularly focused on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elisha has exaggerated Syrian mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "espionage," has been on the line with the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
It's all under the close eye of the U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained its strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "hostage" crisis in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French young woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the U.S. justice system for the trafficking of materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases."
Elisha's strategic adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, have a conversation with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own forcibly held citizens in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "release the words" fundamental human rights, "" innocence, "" immediate release "in the media.
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do so more often."
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discrete channels have been exhausted, "silence will not solve anything," Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers."
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a regular Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He states that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to Iranians of a great deal of money" (230,000 euros of reward).
He also notes that the Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase."
The Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which close to Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French one?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it was not.
The Elisha, he says, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot overturn the decision," he says.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand is still under the "close" surveillance of the French information services.
The Elisha counselor marks a phone number, hangs and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elisha does not spare any effort, uses media releases and "leaks" to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential" role as "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and see that the manipulation brings its fruit, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials."
What is the reason for this "gratitude" to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements of praise, French officials privately recognize that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then addresses the reasons that have led the Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he says.
A policy started in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been mentioned as premature and undeserved."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris tries to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusted him: "of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we have thanked him."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elisha.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirius for having played an "active role in the liberation of our compatriot."
From midnight, young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as indicated by government officials.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under the age of 16, as indicated by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night long and then they find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial head in charge of the bill.
The online games will be available again at 6: 00 in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, it is necessary.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit the time for daily access to these games when the parents of the young people so request, the responsible added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request free software to limit the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world's online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicion of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday appoints the world's Copas' organizing countries of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can come to prevail over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
The backstage transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
It is also difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension by corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of their country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bonfire on Monday by spreading a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to dislike FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who have thrown themselves into an intense lobby in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The Head of Government hopes to reedit the coup successfully given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the 2012 JJ.OO. in London in 2005.
This intense activity, will it be enough to recover the glow of England to the EC?
It is not clear, since the duo Spain-Portugal also has many strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World Cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Cup of Europe in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could bring down their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, turned into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in their candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a direct reference to the accusations by the English press against EC members.
"They're bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favorites.
First world economic power and the headquarters of the main FIFA sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed a separate excellent project.
However, these new applications seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of the TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had suggested that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less.
One mandate in the Elisha leads to another.
The current head of State will therefore be re-elected in 2012.
However, the evidence of this is not well combined with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, we must always appear to be in doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011."
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the Members of the UMP, on Tuesday night at the Elisha, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused a certain stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He just transmitted the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has spoken of the presidential women, with a bragging tone, in such meetings.
"In the worst, or better, of cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, "Do not think that I do not plan what will come next."
His claims of the day before yesterday do not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They subscribe to comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone up to the palestra that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather, on the contrary, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized sooner than planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% compared to 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," he has immediately and prudently reacted to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," he corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the ways out of the crisis or at least to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should be completed by the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt emission institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation in the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in the resolution of the European States' debt crisis.
It did not mean whether it considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its State obligations purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans..."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the purchase programme of State Letters on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's acquisition of Treasury obligations has doubled last week to close to EUR 1.350 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, he would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the euro system have acquired securities of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt at all that the purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in course.
Although the operations of loans over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial and long-term conditions ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I don't imagine you're going to change your program considerably."
"If not, I would risk causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," says Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations in order to keep the market stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the emission institute has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in returns paid by the most fragile States," said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are put out of the clouds, States will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government captures the temporary
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of the 10-year duty rates.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
On the departure of a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "undecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later rejected by the person concerned.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record 210 basis points and the price of the cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had risen to 263 points, causing a certain stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of the associated income, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a jar of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget under review in the Senate is based on 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the government deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
This is why there is a rumour that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be adopted," says Economic Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The bases of his economy are in order and his accounts are in good condition, as we have long said," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD's chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, there would be an unconducive period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of the mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, at night and at day, that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of European States' obligations has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of standardisation.
Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which has a significant impact on banking systems," says Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets."
Aware of this hyate and the dangers it hides, the European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen the mechanisms to emerge from the already existing crisis.
Informal consultations between the most directly affected finance ministers and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (FEEF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
It is expected that the first issues of the EFSF's securities will take place next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative has entrusted the Reuters agency that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries in the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path from that followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid asking for international assistance at all costs before implementing their own budget corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider indispensable for building confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds consider the options available to speed up the process of normalizing the public bond markets.
By way of Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 70 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to redraw the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an amount of about EUR 100 billion additional would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, currently with EUR 60 billion.
A council that could certainly examine European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments in orange alert
The snowfall continues to cause movement difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect a number of economic activities.
Currently, 24 departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to mid-day and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, the heavy snow falls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also slightly snows on the island of France.
A snow layer of between 2 and 5 cm is expected, in a timely manner of between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those in the regions of Baja Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
The snow is strong enough to cause movement difficulties and to affect some economic activities, Météo France alert.
In the Cótes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, the movement in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated and therefore they recommend that it be not driven except in case of need and that the movement of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
On Thursday, school transport in Picardia has been prohibited.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The General Directorate for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly because of the planned snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the island of France has reached its peak, billions have been raining.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the $23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of EUR 4 billion.
At the theoretical level, this will be the sum that will then enable the GSP to obtain loans on the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Amendment Finance Act, discussed at the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists "to modernise it, increase its product and allocate it to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would this method get?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from 4 billion.
"It is necessary that the fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds to be mobilized by the State and that they will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as explained."
"It shall be recorded in the budget and used on a needs-based basis."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised are not on the credit, can lead to a slightly on-going parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Venging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems to be a scandal in the light of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and anticipates a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sindly ridiculizing profile has been giving cabaret artists ideas for creating their sketches for a long time.
The rule that secret records should only be made up of public news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are engaged in occult do not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informer is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little desire) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, what I know, editor of the Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the United States Embassy of Rome to the State Department was the same as the Newsweek published the previous week.
Then why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since the heads of States can call on the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become espionage centres.
Any spectator who sees research films knows it perfectly, we just seem to know that we don't know it for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad picture of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore affects both the victims and the "executioners."
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Earlier, in the time of Orwell, it could be conceived of as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as is now the case, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets be held?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to discover, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like publishing it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, it is not possible to expect to have confidential conversations over the telephone.
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a Head of State has moved by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novelesque, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in proceedings with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by memory or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
This information is then kept in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing as a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the cable-free telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a cable (telephone) telegraph.
The video tapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a step-by-step film, moving forward and back, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to move forward or back from chapter to chapter, that is, to huge proportions.
With the high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travel it takes, we need three and a half hours.
So, it's nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was being secretly set up in the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies who are asking the press for confidential information.
Climate: France's sluts in its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked funding pledges (fast start or early) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French sluts have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed to contribute EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.260 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that their commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The operation of transparency proved to be significant and was appreciated for what was really worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2010 €2.2 billion, which puts it on the right path to meeting its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each person chooses the reference that is best suited to him.
For example, the European Commission has taken the year 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million are added in three years as fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional."
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditure of the previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even lower), while it seeks to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the distribution between grants and loans.
Once again, there is no rule and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to a donated euro.
This is, of course, difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan to the country that grants the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be computed for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document for its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect its commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to meet its commitment, France only provides ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start funding, France is making a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, he gets the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional" as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a negative double impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can just lend?) and in the negotiations, as developing countries are not foolish...
The chapter on early financing is a little, relatively short-term, in relation to all the climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the CMNUCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could make progress in the discussions on the stakes at stake in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get away with the question of "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of the "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move the negotiations forward.
Warning of pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Générations Futures association (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the limited number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem treated," acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the food that is usually consumed by a ten-year-old child in four meals and one snack a day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as the sweets, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or likely carcinogens and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that are likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies of various institutions such as the International Research Centre on Cancer.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to possibly carcinogenic pollutants and / or PE is worrying," the association points out.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that may harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for school, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans in Kenya, included in food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
In addition, Russian filet, tin tuna and even bread bar or gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritious" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk to the consumer of these "pollutant cocktails" is "probably underestimated," says the study.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) Alliance, for its part, has proposed "in view of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the increase in diseases associated with civilization."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
