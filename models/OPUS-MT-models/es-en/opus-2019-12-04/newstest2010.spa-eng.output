Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president of history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will receive them, among other things, for the exceptional effort to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and they will have a lot to do.
First, the visit of the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee who, in October, elected him from 172 people to 33 organizations.
The presidential couple will then have a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive him, although the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will speak of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as President of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check of 10 million Swedish kroner (approximately 24 million Czech kroner).
It is proposed to donate them to charitable paraphim, but it has not yet decided to which particular organization.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will attend.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action."
Nature defender accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police accused of blackmail the president of the civic association Společnost ochráncő přírody Litoměřice (Society of Nature Defenders Litoměřice).
Last year she appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals she demanded from investors money for their own benefit, said the police spokesman of Litoměřice Alena Romová.
The president of the Society of Nature Defenders Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like the containers too much to separate the garbage.
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and in the villages of southern Moravia, containers can be found to separate garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is fully behind in the separation of waste, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but especially because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw in the center a bottle of PET to the right container?
It is almost impossible, above all it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the square Moravské náměstí, in front of the Potrefena Huse.
Don't be angry with me, Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
It is not necessary to mention that it is also not easy to separate the waste elsewhere.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By vagrancy
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy from the city the hockey extravaliga, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or to offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad I can compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little bit, with official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the entire Jihomoravský Kraj region.
The "Paroubek" budget took money from income and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness subsidies or building savings.
But not for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they trusted that the government later asked for a loan for sensitive expenses, income or sickness subsidies. "This means just postponing the problems for the future, it is laying mines," says Janota.
The thing is, when you borrow money, you have to pay more and more interest and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state doesn't have a lot of options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or state operating costs, it has to increase taxes.
To all who added the left now: the firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later, so do your children.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness subsidies, they'll get it. Of these accounts, 1.8 billion disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year they will not miss only 16 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to rise with interest expenditure.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity benefits, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the dislocation of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors where the tender has already been concluded and where the construction process has already begun, the projects of which cannot be changed and the price cannot be reduced.
The best that can be done is to keep them, which is also not free.
This means delay or cessation of the 30 large buildings; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, says the spokesman for the Karel Hanzelka Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD proposed a salomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe, nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year of the dividends are settled ecological damage, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant several compensation to the victims of communism and crime, or for the costs of litigation, including in building savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money within the spring or, at worst, to take over the government budget reserve.
The Státní pokladna (State Fund) project, with a price of two billion, has already been launched, has to be able to monitor online what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to operate with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone where the user can, by pressing a key, change between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
By just pressing a key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This possibility is the objective of the US company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and was demonstrated for the first time several days ago.
It will be released in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer any fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the above-mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
The company VMware cooperates with European and American operators to test for the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains is a matter of concern to hotels
Not only are the telesky maintainers in Krkonoše concerned about the snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow means that people do not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately about our opinion, whether these Christmas will be snow or mud, "said the maintainer of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn according to their expectations should no longer hesitate to reserve the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hotels of Špindlerův Mlýn offer more than weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, he said.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays, "said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer the New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
They are also sold very well in the first 14 days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the snow-free mountain.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will be exhausted as well, "says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
The interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well, "said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the New Year's stay is also occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, as we are about sixty percent of the capacity to occupy.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, the interest in stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hotels in Krkonoše will have a long time waiting for snow.
On Thursday the temperatures must fall and, if there are rainfall, in the mountains it should snow.
But then again the temperatures will rise, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Replay is the Mother of Wisdom · Global Voices
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the most intelligent man, as a diligent student, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his long-awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the "same as in Iraq" speech used several times, but also he did not hesitate to use the title of the Bush statement of January 2007 for his own statement: "A new way forward."
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, demonstrated that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today nothing is spoken of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided gunmen in the White House to a hard criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't think of anything better, so at least he tricked the general over 10,000 military.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself had previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing about Obama's whole strategy seems to be its goal, starting to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and ending this procedure in three years. Obama's whole doctrine generated more questions from the answers it offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin, after which patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action," a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is plagued by its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to their electors, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will be a dramatic setback to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential elections are three years away and that is why there is still a long time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
The directors of the Goldman Sachs bank will never receive the cash bonuses again.
The top executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced this to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, the actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to link the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer way to go, mentioned the former investor bank of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after having set aside almost $17 billion (almost $300 billion CZK) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of the bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $20 billion.
The high-level banking bonuses became a sensitive issue in politics with the arrival of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at one time, with a tax of 50 percent, the bank bonuses that exceed 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prize in all categories but Physics
Five women, a record number, received the Nobel Prize this year in specialized categories and in literature in Stockholm today from King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, the award-winners also included a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemistry was received by the Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last prize, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the RCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each award was awarded the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kroner (approximately 25 million Czech kroner).
In the case of several awards in each category, the award is shared with each other.
The traditionally most expected Nobel, the Peace, received it this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, American President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential for peace, even if its price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in government, as he disagrees with the version of the state budget for next year, approved Wednesday by the House of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota's stay in the cabinet, is supposed to be the subject of his meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the quote, President Radim Ochvat's spokesman reported.
On his stay in the office, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared for signature by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of Kroner 163 billion.
The House of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the left-hand proposals for the transfer of funds and increased money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the Social Democrats' proposals, as they covert the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Party of the Greens, began to be controversial.
Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of hanging measures, imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to stop public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem," that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus between the political parties, could improve this situation, the President says.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is horrific and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice president of ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words as "strong sentences."
ČSSD's head, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is horrific, prepared for this year by former government of Topolánek. It will exceed 200 billion kroner.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were happy, too.
Mandela in the new film by Clint Eastwood, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by American Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the prize for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in the Almighty Evan. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became President of the country.
In 1993, he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racial and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to join his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join the rugby players, who belong in the world measure to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
"I had no other goal but to play this role in such a way that it was as close as possible to reality," Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that by pressing your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard rugby world.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his house.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened up, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much taller in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In the movie reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
The secret of splendor over resolved Norway: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence finally recognized yesterday that a ballistic intercontinental missile was tested near the borders with Norway.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" type missile, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Even its repeated presence in the missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or there was a failure in the air.
In the Russian newspapers they write of "Bulavá" as "a missile that does not fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but it shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the apparatus.
The engine probably broke out in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a ship that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That is why the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, is likely to be the failed "Bulavá."
The Norwegian from the very first moment did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that one cannot simply talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile sustained and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately broken in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the Ministry of Defence management only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to claim that "Bulavá" one day will fly smoothly and that it will even be able to carry up to ten nuclear hyper-onic blocks, with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA in Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will be reintroduced at the age of 51 to a professional hockey meeting.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play Friday in KHL's duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov completed his career at the age of 40 in 1998 and currently presides over the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
"We just have to solve some formal issues," AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club coach.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of the ones who can raise the mood of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, he will become the longest professional player of Russian hockey.
The legendary front man Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic oars, seven world championships, he won the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he was also successful at the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Glory Room.
Hyundai met the requirements of the trade unions. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
It was precisely because of the frequent additional work that the trade unions declared on Monday the strike emergency.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai automotive factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
"We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary additional work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will work in two shifts," Vanděk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way its employees are motivated by the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, that is to say, prolong in one day the Christmas parties, said Vaněk.
In addition, all employees on Saturday's shifts will receive money for the trip and for the food.
Because the additional work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the address yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the additional work for December, said Vaněk.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the trade unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kuchağ trade unions said on Wednesday, that if they committed themselves to meeting the requirements and signed the document, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the car factory was aggravated last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent additional work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
Management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The trade unionists in their statement of the strike emergency on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, who interrupted the manufacture last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
As far as additional work is concerned, trade unions require the company to minimize it.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of Kroner 5,000.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial manufacturing was started last November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'encalled' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some medicines already accessible.
AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, patients' lives may be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the virus replication is not completely deleted, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the medicines no longer work.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg shows the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that the substances called metalocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way from all the medicines used today, and so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, "improved 'compounds, prepared to know the molecular mechanism of their link to the albumin of the virus.
Metalocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are bound by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
HIV proteasis is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteasis, there is no fractionation of the HIV virus and no mature and infectious corpuscules of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV proteasis, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective.
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV proteasis was performed as a test test, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicinal products, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, where the medicinal products often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metalocarborans are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlína Đezáčová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of organic and biochemical chemistry and the Institute of molecular genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
He fights over the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he's defending himself.
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for next year is "terrible" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think of its future existence.
The statements of ODS were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time for analysis.
The vice president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the House of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas said.
The House of Deputies approved the 2010 budget yesterday, however with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion kroner.
The House of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of State officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the ODS proposals, as they completely increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of RKK 163 billion.
Before the vote, ODS left the room and thus fulfilled the government's wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusion and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of the adoption of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He said, he's thinking of staying in the show.
The reason is your disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government have nothing to do with those nominated by the ČSSD, which imposed the budget changes.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear, if he will resign, whether the House will adopt other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sick subsidies, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not to blame
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, said Topolánek in the US text news
He recalled that in several ministries at the senior positions there are people belonging to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the public finances deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, to rely on the left majority, which is currently in the House of Deputies."
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I have not thought about that, when the time is right, I will take care of it, the defense minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the members of ODS, told the journalists in the House of Deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a European Council meeting in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS ceded at the Prime Minister's request
Nečas stressed that on Wednesday in the House of Deputies he would probably vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the SDGs Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
He didn't realize my vote was missing.
"As he resigned from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the Bolshevik of the House of Deputies and the destruction of all the positive," Topolánek himself reacted.
According to ČD's new train schedule, fewer trains will be running at almost the same rates.
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total traffic extension will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities for links to the capital will be won for example by the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, dráhy for this line will add a pendolino conveyance.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not move back to Bratislava.
In the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate fewer fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in dráhy-planned transport is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced only to a few days a week.
One of the greatest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance links to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From December 13, the travelers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino again.
This year's regional railway account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive next year four billion kroner in total, as this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion kroner in total, and the State will help them almost three billion kroner.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local drahy trains they have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year.
Drahy is happy with the system, and perhaps that's why the prices of a large majority of the tickets did not increase.
The changes will only take place in one-day tickets - ČD Net and in cheap eLiška Internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the ČD Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the single price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.
Filipino armed forces continue to hold more than 50 people, children released
The armed people have now abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including a number of primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 children in detention and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed people use the hostages as a living shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed men belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to agency AP, the police had previously pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of the local families.
In the south of the Philippines in Maguindanao province it was because of the recent killing, in which 57 people were killed, imposed by martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor's elections, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they renewed peace dialogues with the Philippine government.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech esInvictus: Neporažený), is released in American cinemas, which captures part of the biography of former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself for the leading role.
The second role, that of the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize with Klerk.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa preparations for the world football championship are completed. At the same time, the media are shocked by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by Hollywood's "uninteresting" stars.
Morgan Freeman says, however, that he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as is said - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the holiday premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the movie we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated into the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also as the protagonist puts on the suit of the national South African rugby team and enters the field. RSA then won the world cup.
For entering the grille in the suit, which in RSA is considered to be almost sacred, Mandela 14 years ago won great ovations, especially of the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may help people join and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are sceptical, as said in an interview just for LN, a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer burns with a value of tens of millions of kroner
The fire has caught in the morning a transformer from the Čeps company in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the fire spokesman for the Ustí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
The firefighters previously wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but they later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandatová, the company's spokesperson, the failure does not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million kroner, to list it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing similar happened, the faults of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the company's spokesperson for the North Choch, the power supply was not cut off, and the fire of the power substation did not affect the functioning of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps půsuperí in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distributive system, of the electrical conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical power from the transmission system to the distributor system, and also maintains the electrical drive of 4339 kilometres long.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander to three ČSSD hetmanes
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a slander complaint against three social democratic hetmans.
These are Michal Hašek from the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martinek from Pardubický kraj and the Hetman from Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in 20 minutes on Radiožurnál.
Demand has to do with the company's efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three Hitmans are attacking us and they talk about the fact that we are "taking the raisins from the cake," however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of slander towards the Society Student Agency, he said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also mentioned having the evidence from all regions, according to which they have not taken necessary measures in line with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hitmans to do so too.
I suppose, also on this occasion, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jančura manipulates the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
To Radiožurnál he told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said, that the campaign will be carried out against the corudum as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the commission of approximately 150 billion kroner did not convene a tender.
According to Jančura, similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a member of ČSSD, because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we can lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of ČSSD, I know, what sir it is, I will not say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumoccal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumoccal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the compulsory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcus vaccine are complete.
The Medicines Institute is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also clear about this in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
As of January, children born since 2 August last year will be free to receive the pneumoccal vaccine.
The condition is not to have received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth months of age of the child.
Last year, one quarter of families voluntarily let their children be vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 kroner and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate the younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand kroner per year on vaccines.
Unclutched will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state spent all the vaccination of children approximately 500,000 annually.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Neumococcus is the cause of mean otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Of the pneumoccal infections in our country, 28 children under 10 years of age die every year according to hospital research.
In addition to the Czech Pneumoccal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
However, at the same time, opinions appear that this vaccine may be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The compulsory vaccine would be better, said for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Its association has been spreading pneumoccal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
"I think this is the way we now have to go," Kalovský said.
The Ministry of Health does not, however, want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
"At the moment, we do not think at all," said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeț.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say.
The president of the pediatrician society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařł Hana Cabrochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children were to receive the vaccine, it would be possible to reason for the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs so high, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," Cabrochová says.
The experts expect, that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents let their babies vaccinate against pneumococcus.
The pneumoccal vaccine is a major change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save on treatment later, explains Cabrochová.
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "get the money out of health insurance."
The doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait, until they are paid for by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a remarkable sum.
"It will be nothing easy," Cabrochová says.
The son of an American artist "involved in the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 pictures on his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used a excavator to break into the museum, in the region of the Pocono Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan el Barbaro and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer stated that a family dispute may have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that the 52-year-old Frazatta son declared to the police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta father denied granting such permission.
Labour party advocates tax increases in budget
Ministers have supported the tax increases and the cost cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism of the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Conservators said that Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the cut in the deficit, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for damaging low and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in social security expenditure and a 1 per cent ceiling in public sector wage agreements as of 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have regretted that low-wage workers are punished by a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems."
The increase in social security spending, which will grow by about £3 billion per year, has enraged the business community, which states that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CLAVE POINTS OF THE ANIMAL REPORT TO THE BUDGET
Social security with an additional 0.5% increase from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
The 1 point increase in company tax for small firms was excluded
Tax relief for electric cars and wind turbines
The State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 per year and who earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 per year will earn £110.
Ministers said that their goal of halving the deficit for 2013 involved "difficult decisions," but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall to 5% of the highest wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that the tax increases and the cuts in expenditure outlined were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decrease predicted in April, while the demand for loans would be £3 billion above the above estimated.
"wasted opportunity."
The Conservators, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said that the projection of loan applications for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, "cynically" dodging difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
"All important ads will be made after the elections, win whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction in the deficit in the shorter term.
But the liberal Democrats said that the money raised by tax increases and cost cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that projects were like "sand castles."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that the time chosen for the ads, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies in April, mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to accusations of electoral manoeuvres, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided with it more and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really postponing the pain for later," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets are aware of this."
FBI reports on "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid to a house in Sarghoda, eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said that it is investigating if they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, USA, last month.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was also looking for information about men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing," said the spokesman.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the sights of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, said Reuters news agency; but she said that the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported his disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International Condemns Iranian "Abuse"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been the same as poor, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details the regime's "models of abuse" before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticism has a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and the dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession."
Amnesty International cited the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... they threatened to execute me and they humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and released it and left it in the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who stated that he was held in a container together with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the unease of the post-election and government response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's inquiries had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski court was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, in front of a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that it was quite scary.
You see it under a beautiful view of the lights of the city typing.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent, "he added.
The awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be melted.
Even them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and when there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as fans of the author's latest work "Why the French do not like veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France with what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly worldly issues, he says, things of daily life, that concern the media more than the political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom are renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not able to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so ferociously defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggested that Muslims should probably have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who had also had to make their historical commitments to secular republanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "an adjustment of values."
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolate picture in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On thin ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and policy of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of courage in facing the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a courageous 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the zoos are still generally a millionth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was green by the algae that grow within the hair-free areas of its fur.

Ellis uses stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimos Indians in motonieves use high-power assault rifles to take down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a pitiful look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not like scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not a lack of effort.
The pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th century gave signs for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the cold-war submarines drew a map of the ice-laces moving under the ice masses.
The satellite scans and the extensive series of probes mounted on the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, made up of saline chorritos that compress while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, what is believed can happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... this could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 that place crowns in the tombs of Arlington
Pfc. De 'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where they are embarking us, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Corona Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year by stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 kroner in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, tombs in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Batteries Park in New York City and the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late career military.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older tombs of the First World War, the Second World War, and the Vietnam War, because they don't receive as many visits as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took their hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the dark atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud names carved on the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who played the tears of her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
"No one should ever forget why we are free." my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember."
Cuban officials arrested a US government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who distributed mobile and laptop in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost anything considered "dangerous."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including minor and critical written protests, pose the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an emerging blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor can probably cause tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a "slow-paced" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in Cuba's prison are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, same Cuba," a reference to the location of Raul Castro as the country's leader, to replace his sick brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops, saying they expect the case to help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who travel the Internet in search of radicalized young people.
Researchers said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a family place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince the al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing north-west mountains, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said that the men did not interfere and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by Pakistani police authorities.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who they are.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people within al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not to let go of those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said that al Qaeda is particularly concerned about the aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent an enormous appeal, because of their potential to have access to American goals and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about those who admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
"If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model how many have already followed?" Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate "action"
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding the negotiators working at the Bella Center Convention Center of the city, bold actions for the climate.
The protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding English-language banners that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "The Earth says" enough already. "
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travel Peru, his mother's home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with because of the impacts of the climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
The police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or because of the carrying of pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists with sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the main channel in Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were through the buildings, he said, adding that they started as calls, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I was really not aware of the situation."
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it was up to each other's perspective to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence data reveal persistent racial differences
Last week's federal score book on mathematics performance was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the best-performing systems in the country, the grade book showed that fourth and eighth-grade students have been slimming at a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Education Progress Assessment is the persistent difference in performance between African American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of the fourth grade white students in D.C. over the last two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, decreasing a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between the fourth-grade white and black students in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the gap has only been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by addressing those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
"I am not leaps of joy for a difference of two or three points," said the D.C. Council member, Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-by accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's style of administration, said the message from the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what is concerned is that we are not devoting the time and energy necessary for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students from the higher grades of primary and middle school, who did not dominate the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten to sixth grade, that emphasizes games and real life experiences, which was introduced in the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
"I just think we need to continue to work to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the level of grade," Rhee said.
Others say that the results of the ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here's a kind of creepy dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution to the conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C..
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to hold on to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It is necessary to reach almost 200 days to have the force of change, Janey said, that he reached an agreement with the union of his teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which he considers to be a "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resonance.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, went down and blinded for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Even so, when she and the other eighth-grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where enrolment costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
"Yes! This is where I will be!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
"Wow, really?," he said thinking, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of school teacher-students.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day journey, and had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to go to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who have access to university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduated from university, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze the most successful say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to university, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Noting low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that financed the tour of the universities of Graciela is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement university preparation programs, which start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish secondary school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending university, according to the United States Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government was able to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
The US companies moved away, having bid in only two of the 10 auctioned deposits.
Seven United States companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two United States companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants at the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombardment on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdraw, probably prevented US oil companies from risking more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest oil reserve in the world, analysts said.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main United States firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have strengthened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts granted this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main sites.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman for the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the same time as its competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda's main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a major Al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to American sources and Pakistani officials from the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a Pakistan civil intelligence agency official said, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two American counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military planner, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of the American air attacks within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide from Al Qaeda's top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had quickly ascended into the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat that he posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second al-Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led non-pilot aircraft attacks has decreased since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a count from The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while they are ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
The UN's maximum envoy in Kabul about to resign
The top United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-supported Afghan presidential election.
Eide's departure occurs when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the US schedule for the military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will drive other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also put pressure on the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials working together in Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigned, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Registrar.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
"What I have said is that they better start looking for a successor," Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "surely damaged the mission, because there was already much scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said that he proposed the appointment of a high civilian representative to coordinate the assistance efforts of the United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also promoted the leadership of the UN to allow its successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, saying that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine his ability to attract talent.
That is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, for its failure to engage in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 American troops in northern Iraq, during a week's trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, subtracted the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions for Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives," "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the instructions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge for peaceful purposes only.
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would agree to leave a substantial part of his stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from the tentative agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set the 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including continuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "baseless and baseless accusations," by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and partnership.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the outstanding reduction. U.S. officials cited the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will pay for their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them. "
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that were lecturing them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aged population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We've already given all our time and energy just for a child.
"We have nothing left for a second," said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously rehonchos children, the only children who were spoiled, affectionately nicknamed "small emperors," a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy was implemented, according to the Division
UN demographics, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to exploit from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultured populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 per cent of the registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aged population and mitigate a future labour shortage."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
In the 1978 constitution of the country, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have supported the policy for its contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have done abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female proportion.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost the morning, the posters that ordered families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations that detailed who would be suitable for a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also pledged to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials of a rural city outside Shanghai claim to have observed a moderate increase in the number of couples who want a second child after the campaign's launch, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu municipality's family planning committee in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want to give the best to their first son, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they say, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yeah, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wants a unique child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to all taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained this more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers, who reduce the birth rate, he said, this is about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between 20 and 30 years old grew up looking at their parents' struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from the parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are issues of space, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic one "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best day care when the child is 9 months old."
"Most of his friends are willing to face this once," Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, took renewed attention on Friday with the dissemination of a document that provides for ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that carry most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the overall temperature increase that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, a high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Bóer, described as "the big picture."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions over the same period by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week was presented.
The United States Special Climate Envoy, Todd Stern, rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking on a tougher line with China, with respect to what Bush administration officials did only two years ago.
The United States will not agree without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the US's top climate negotiator lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for having said earlier this week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global overheating.
With the future economic trajectory of the major powers of the world at stake, the lines of failure have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries of the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in seeking to contain the major emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change adviser for Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, even if most major participants say that the talks will at most produce political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States developed a proposal for a preliminary treaty of 24 pages early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government come to a close.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Minister, came down from the planes and ran to the Bella Center corridors, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delimit the claims to be declared next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people come in and out of the convention center every day, the activists playing the guitar present night shows mocking the countries that they say are being sold, and preliminary proposals are being passed from hand to hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice President for the global policy of Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
The first train at 225 km from Britain redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5.13 on Monday morning, a whistle will drill the dark to point to a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed interurban train will reach 225 kmh, when it passes as a lightning from Ashford, Kent, to the St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first Javelin interurban service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened and the shift of planes and cars to the rail would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still stop the high-speed lines of Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times knew.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn up within 25 metres of a final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will establish three options for a larger high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once completed, the travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to the little over one hour today.
The proposals would allow the trains to travel to 402 kmh, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support 400 mt long trains, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the space restrictions of the capital, it is expected that an existing station will be extended to fit the high-speed network.
The experts of the railway industry argue that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines along existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping the travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered the crucial point necessary to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face the mortgage for an orange of £75,000 from a Conservator
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the deputies lived "of rations," increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension in his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding up to hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications in due course and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who leads a review of the members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said that the requests "could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, has a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton electoral district.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange."
The neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Rules and Privileges of the House of Commons on its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271.406 pounds from his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
The documents issued this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately £1,400 per month in mortgage interests, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to over £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the whole increase was going to finance the £75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, the type to which it is now located.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to apply for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as President of the House's opposition in September, after a undercover reporter filmed him saying that the deputies had to survive "rations" after the expense scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated as m * * rda."
He said, "I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't. "
The Member, a millionaire for his old profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this could "be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the sterling pound symbol on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he requested £4,000 for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It is not a question of circumventing and offending or infringing the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could in no way be clearer or simpler. "
Come those who have faith, to see the schedule of the Advent of the Palapa of the beach of Brighton
Brighton's palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with stuffed pastry and free punch.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, O Ven, O Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid cleric from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said, "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christianity society."
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the schedule of the advent of the palapa began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality. "
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, all over the world and in Copenhagen, where several hundred people were arrested by the police.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, raided for the Danish capital frost in demand of an agreement to be reached by the United Nations Conference on Climate Change by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for the climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the fact that "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen is very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the demonstration began in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the "Black Blocks," ultra violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were "detained without distinction," stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sitting in spite of the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the venue of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by coach and train from large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial squabbers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and the climate."
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt for the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
"We cannot continue to say: there is time," said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry, watercourses that you can walk through as you have never been able to do before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial stunt to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than 100 people, mostly students, paraded in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters were working hard to combat climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday, Abkhazia, a South-East separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected President; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud."
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 under the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17: 00 GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing President, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting.
These elections are a sham.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia is trying to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the banks of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch next to the Russian president and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian leaders who came to control the conduct of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said, "We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and particularly the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
"I hope that his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations," replied Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: World demonstrations, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday tens of thousands of people went to the streets of the world to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an impressive demonstration.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, were in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December the delegates of 193 countries, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the center, without trying to get in.
A stage was set up to welcome the guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle vigil.
A few moments after the beginning of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks," which were ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near a busy house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to the police.
The extremist groups were not taken from their eyes, I anticipate the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the law enforcement helicopters were flying over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by car and train from the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial squabbers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and the climate."
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt for the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
Oxfam together with former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to head the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial stunt to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed red dresses and wearing scarves in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters claiming to act against climate change were formed.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview to be transmitted in the Sunday Informativo (JDD, according to his French sign) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific high school.
From now on, all students in the first high school will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "it is enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch," but "in general, it summons the best students."
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be subservient of the C, he continues to stress even: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged for having eliminated history and geography in the second high school in technological schools."
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate the compulsory history-geography teaching in second grade C. Many intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the high school second program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also do real-life training during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as trainee teachers.
If you make all the pre-contest practices, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education."
It also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012."
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street High Normal School, accepted on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, opened the conference conference conference "Ernest," a day composed of a series of 15-minute presentations by experts, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and convey to them a desire to know more, he explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22 years, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts of his discipline and selected them on his charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who presented no notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about 50 people.
It is part of our scientific role, he said, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record."
The videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays in payments: disgust among prison guards, plans to take action
On Friday, the prison guard unions called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year, the premiums and the overtime, which was postponed to the EU for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd Guards' Union) asked staff out of service to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to report the theft of their assets.
The CGT (3rd trade union of the profession) calls them "to meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization," as it calls for "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Union of Penitentiary (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury."
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased much in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation is caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours in the future.
The December pay will then be low, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous job and objective premiums, and who "always blame the budgetary requirements," the Ufap / Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, said the interregional union FO of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and calls."
The staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if the October days are not paid in December, the same will happen with the overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As we get more tasks and missions without being more effective, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's salary, the CGT in Bordeaux estimates.
According to trade unions, the same is not true in all regions, as some are more fortunate than others.
But in any case, the result is not the one expected, said the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than the ones he receives.
American President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television host, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about the gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that the ABC network will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the year-end parties in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged partner, will be from the game.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the excerpts from the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way, I made you nice gifts last year," he said, provoking the president.
It's true, he was forced to admit it before he responded with humor pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign with devotion, the President and his wife also remembered their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who saw rarely, gave him for Christmas.
"I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball," the President said.
Only many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
On her side, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of setting them around the home, however, I loved that doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday was again operated, RTL claims to be in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again involved in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors found "injuries from the operation" of the discal hernia carried out in Paris on November 26, he noted his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a restorative operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility by saying that the situation was "under control," and reported that a new medical part would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications."
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about their condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Monceau Park due to a discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, an intimate friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on Thursday at RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said that there was no "problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
"He called me just before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to get 12 hours of plane after such an operation, it is not possible," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure himself that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted successfully to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled."
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems have increased since July when he was admitted for nine days to a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on a "colon cancer," after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Tour 66," presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overstated. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the musician's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives had to even deny a new internment.
Euro-2009 / short pool: first title of Bousquet in your favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist in the World Cup-2009 long pool, on Thursday obtained an international title in a distance through which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Istanbul.
In the first day of this competition in which the polyurethane swimwear were last allowed, only three records of the world were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A shame for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand that it has in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20 "53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane swimwear from 1 January will be prohibited.
These bathers, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, have finished their epopeia in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark by 400 m free (3: 32.77), however, he imposed himself with the second best time of his career (3: 34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82).
I didn't give myself up in depth in this race.
I knew I wouldn't be able to beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
"Lobintsev will be a hard rival in the future," Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola was sold in USD 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, announced the art dealer of Sotheby's.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated at between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "that represents four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satiros and drunk women, is a rare piece, since in the world there are only four or five," he explained on Tuesday to AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most puzzled by the buyers, without a doubt, a spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, marble was found to be an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about 50 years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
By reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart."
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions were not in place to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied the safe way.
At the moment, following a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government aircraft that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya back to its place of origin, according to a source of the General Directorate of Migration.
To grant him a safe way, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "give up" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to arrive in Mexico as the head of state in a guest exercise.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my office (...), they wanted me to submit my resignation," Zelaya said on Thursday to Globo radio, in which he often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been in Central America for five months.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing chords the deposed president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted an application for a safe way, but unfortunately we could not accept it for not containing a request for asylum, the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, said on Wednesday to Honduran radio HRN.
"I will not seek asylum from any country," Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with the Telesur network, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as President of the Honduran people, he said.
Rumours about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
That reflects the marginal nature of this government against international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, when he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must be held accountable to the Justice for the crime of "high treason," according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term of office ended on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, the US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell in October to 7.6 per cent over September, to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, the analysts expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular, the exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that they trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research company Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registration in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bonus was 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bonus to 4.492% against 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power booze "Ladies in White" · Global Voices
This Thursday, hundreds of supporters of the Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
About forty "Ladies in White," wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked in the street by supporters of the Raul Castro government as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of those detainees, an AFP journalist said.
The Yankees die! "Mercenarias!," "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!," "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" the militants of the power used to chew the dissidents with their fists.
The latter were escorted by civilian-dressed agents who came to "protect them."
On the eve, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Damas de Blanco" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who also learned to manifest on Thursday for international human rights day, was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, an AFP journalist reported.
The agents forced the vehicles into the dissidents who were harassed by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "Ladies in White," awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners," about 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, purges a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call the opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" on the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely done in the media, Cuban television reported on the Thursday demonstration of government militants against the "counter-revolutionaries."
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alienated man kills an octogenary with a knife and leaves five wounded in Clichy-la-Garene
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garene (Altos del Seine) on Thursday at the time of the greatest influx in the afternoon
Según los primeras elementos de la investigación, el agresor de 28 años, habría golpeado con dos cuchillos y por motivaciones still no determinos, a un anciano, en la farma o ante a esta en el No. 85 del boulevar Jean-Jaurès, informaron fuentes policial y testigos.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Then at or in front of the pharmacy, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, got in the way and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman was fainted and "in a state of shock," a police source reported.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, was reportedly escaped by the Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
Apparently at random, he would have hurt two more pedestrians: a 30-year-old man, and a 40-year-old man.
At night, the crime scene was still unclarified.
He was armed with two butcher knives on his back, an Alliance union leader at the Seine Heights, Arnaud Pressé, explained on the site.
Several bystanders, including young people, tried to control the alienated, according to the testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy about thirty years old in a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, said Alberto, a bartender from a nearby bar.
A crowd went over him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
By the Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the age of 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were beaten to death, according to police testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garene, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. By putting him in a safe position, I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, he told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of about 35 years old arrived, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Department of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his pre-trial detention, he did not speak.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of placing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were required to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
It was "in a state of overarousal" as "all of this type of upset whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks for the case to be dismissed
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), called for the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, to be dismissed for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "El Pianist," reported to three judges of the Second District of California's Appeals Chamber serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: "I claim that the charges are dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband," was "creepy."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (died since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before sentencing, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and deserted" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September to have "lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a girl under the age of 13.
Since then, the United States has never stepped on it again.
Los Angeles District Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing."
"With this cause, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility to flee?" Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, even though he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to deliver their sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He claims that his client no longer supports being harassed every time the Polanski case resents, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months after the bars, he was sentenced to house imprisonment in his cabin in Gstaad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street is losing its way and is being held back by the dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed this undirected Friday, in a market that is discussed among better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of a technological component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced from 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is very quiet," Mace Blicksilver said, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of trade is increasingly reduced and I believe that this will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the soundness of economic recovery," Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second consecutive month and greater than expected.
In addition, US consumer confidence was visibly recovered in December, 73.4 to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed by a further advance of the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "leads to a decline in sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bonus was 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bonus to 4.497% against 4.492% on the eve.
Miss World's Choice Again in South Africa
After a month of tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are on the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world against a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Deportista or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
"I saw a lot of things and I lived through countless experiences," Miss Sierra Leone said.
This competition, which is held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast on Saturday live from Midrand, North Johannesburg, from 17: 00 (15: 00 GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with women candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take away their breath."
After a month of galas, essays, press conferences and safaris, the candidates for Miss World are concentrated in the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted to Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will walk in traditional dresses and, of course, in a swimsuit.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time on a bike, and tasted local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African President, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Something unusual for a head of State, Ms. Sierra Leone notes.
His best memory will no doubt be the drawing in Cape Town (South West) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I never thought I'd get to know.
She's probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," his son David said on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport to accompany his father in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, he told the press David Hallyday as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after local 13: 00 (21: 00 GMT).
The son of the singer, distended, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection resulting from the discal hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to manage his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, following a discal hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French lycée in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
"There is talk of a possible lawsuit," he said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice as a discal hernia, he added.
Shortly before at RTL, he said that the singer had apparently "left without a cannula, with nothing," after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a brain bleeding.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted of justice on several occasions for malapraxis, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" regularly sued "before the Council of the Order, and is" far from being recommended. "
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
The latter indicated that the intervention "took place without any inconvenience" and that the results of the post-operative studies were "normal."
The operation "could not cause bleeding and, portanto, did not need drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have increased since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
"No doubt, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems to me very risky," Camus said.
The association UDF raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its symbol
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the sign of the former Giscardist party, intimating him to withdraw it from all support, subject to the penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, as he considered that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having laid his hand on his left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his management, he was assisted by the deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the Member to encourage them to give up the sign and to transfer the property rights of the brand, subject to the penalty of judicial action.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that you would propose to your political movement to recover the UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Central Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the + Nouveau centre +, and the slogan + l'UDF d'aujourd'hui + in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, the signatories of the letter maintain.
As you know, they have no right to use the sign, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to "immediately withdraw the mention of the UDF name from any support, as well as from (its) Internet site."
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to the legitimate right-holders."
If they do not do so, they will appeal to the courts to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a true political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP."
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF.
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to set up an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when it registered the brand," it was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years," but of the UMP.
It obnoxious and fraudulent the absence of registration of the acronym UDF for the purpose of doing it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before making fun of the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to become their own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that is not entitled to."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Nanterre Court decided to bring to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt said, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenary to expolate her from a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga over one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are disputed the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered that the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt be subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The designated doctors will be required to submit a report by 10 March 2010, stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from a state of weakness and during which periods.
I think he'll take it.
"I will speak to her," said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, on his way out of the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers's lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and a multifaceted artist, accusing him of having taken advantage for years of his mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers to be a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleadings sometimes resulted in a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that his client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he distrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt said, "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once and twice a day for 15 years.
Since his wedding, I've never been able to talk to Françoise again. "
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office once again considered that the complainant was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardian judge refused, in recent days, to give rise to her request to open a judicial procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to come to justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person may appear in his place, "said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would take a decision after the trial of the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of the partners adhering to "values" determined from above as before to impose on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to the customer's preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially of R & amp; D and, even more so, of business intelligence.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have a proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision"; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would be to put the collaborators at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire carried out by Orange among its employees, have an impact on the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
"In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all the companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!" B989
- Second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from large engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behavioral theory that American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "commands" (sic) of the executive commitment, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a mechanical management position, unadapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the good functioning of modern companies means adopting a finalist view of human behaviour.
It is to integrate into all business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make part of its dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of the motivations of the employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of the mobilization factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate the management of human resources "in place."
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, acclaimed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of the war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing that the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama adversary, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives was pleased, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
"At times, the speech seemed very historic to me," Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former elected representative, who some consider to be a possible candidate for the Republican investiture for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or able to deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current Washington Post chronicler, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting itself as a "citizen of the world," as "always does," he "spoke as an American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few not very convinced right-wing, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "monotonous, pretentious and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the President's left, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, the left-center press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, described his speech as "overproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "delivered the speech that was necessary," said the New York Times, judging it as "both gloomy and edifying."
Carrier transport: three maratonic negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three maratonic negotiations sessions, the road sector unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement that ends the call for a strike and the threat to Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "happy" for the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators fired at Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the text in agreement at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTHE) withdrew with a cover.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very harmful to companies" and "was feared to disturb the end-of-year parties," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from €8.72 to 9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, said Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there be no more cuts and no more blockages in the supply centres.
But there can always be some dissatisfied rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, recognized that this was "a good agreement," although it was "difficult to grant higher wages increases in the light of international competition."
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects the employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement."
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase of 3 per cent in travel costs and the holding of general assemblies for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible to address the issue of extraordinary pay and the modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of EUR 100 million in the employers' charges" was the subject of an amendment by the government in the 2009 draft rectification finance law, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "on the same terms."
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply, first, to the companies that have joined this organization and, second, to the whole profession, if the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR reported that it was a "business of ingenuity," as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an urgent situation, not in conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but in order not to counter those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, Unostra lamented.
For the other, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months."
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The conflicts in the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the second day of strike between trade unions and the RATP management, there was no agreement and the trade unions were dissatisfied with their request for a premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday they will only travel trains between 10: 00 and 20: 00, at the rate of one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train in four on the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which are waiting for 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "the RATP strives to provide service to the large shops."
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP route runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains moved in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the rallies thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less crowded than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time."
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, SNCF indicated, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general meetings of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the trade unions, of a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analysed.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what drivers who claim a premium due to them want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT said, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
Which also led trade unions to say that the company "did not care about weekend users."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Indipendants have submitted a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indipendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has a million passengers a day.
The RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for times with alternated shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could very much complicate the task of the government, which has just given a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that adversely affected the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its President Ahmet Türk and Deputy Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of party property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that the Members would leave Parliament before being parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision arises from a procedure launched by the Supreme Court Prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it has no "organic ties" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes at a time when the government is giving a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a number of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds will stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the South-East anatol, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan degenerated in clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city of the South-East, mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters were throwing Molotov bombs or stones with funds.
In Istanbul, about 100 people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was to "deepen discouragement."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
We are, as a matter of principle, opposed to the closure of parties.
"This does not solve anything," said the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in Northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
The snow can start suddenly
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not at all is something you want to make life impossible for the citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the FES
But with this your employees can learn to test and master all of the vehicle technology.
Maybe on the weekend the meteorologists will announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case the FES acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called "A" sections with large salt vehicles come out, Brauburger explains.
For example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also access to the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts around 3: 00 in the morning
It should be covered approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts at about three in the morning, "with it the tracks are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins."
The hard thing is when it starts snowing around 7: 30.
"Then we have a problem," says the road maintenance director in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear up the salt vehicles."
Immediately after that, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, which also belong to the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the trouble is generated, Brauburger tastes good.
Around five in the morning the FES infantry is set in motion, the dangerous points and cruises are mainly cleared.
In general, the FES could not take over all the bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22: 00 to 4: 30 hours does not lose sight of the bridges, Brauburger says.
As these become slippery quickly, the salt vehicle is put into operation as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police may also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa hallae had the same look as many other carnivores: a two-meter-long, 1.50-meter-high animal running on the two strong back legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been a special thing.
But the Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is unprecedented for the Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, a total of five specimens were collected.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "The dinosaur fossils of the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the older fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, the experts discuss, for example, when the sauriums were divided into their three most important genealogical linings: the carnivores teropod (which include the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the sauropods quadrupeds known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivores (saurios with bird pelvis), to which they belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa Hallae's skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those that also possess the descendants of the teropod, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
In the case of Tawa Hallae also the bones of the spine were clearly partially air-filled.
Tawa is the theropod with the oldest and most primitive air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the subsequent giant sauropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers inferred that the sauries arose there for the first time.
Therefore, the three genealogical lineage were separated in the beginning and spread from South America across all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a unique terrestrial mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa found the remains of two other theropods not closely related.
The three cannot come down from a unique related predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three waves of migration were given to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many fossils of dinosaurs continue to be preserved, while in other continents there is little to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their life space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of the current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other sauries.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship was extinguished at the limit of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
The successful stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have given a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteor impact stops the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino at the Goethe University of Frankfurt had an impact on the whole world.
278 teachers and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command."
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on the freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "the de-legitimization and criminalization of the protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The Board of Directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers require the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, says Verdi's national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We're grateful to the rector of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in a broadcast of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of Wiesbaden province.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext for criminalizing the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of studying the students' arguments and demands in depth, they are being evicted.
The Left has submitted a motion, in which the Minister of the Interior is requested to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was a heavily guarded site in the Soviet Union for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from central Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley."
Here are important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
A number of mutual visits were given and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of close collaboration."
Moscow Vice-Mayor Juri Rosljak and the mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt he signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, they will travel to a seminar in Selenogrado, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science research centre.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also deals with commercial relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the great consortia Sytronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Socialist Planning" for arms research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") was named after the landscape of forest mountains, where research facilities were established.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not placed at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is simply a matter of "the new heart of Europe."
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end up in the middle of the city, were then considered engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brakes of a modern rail traffic, since it took a huge amount of time to hook the locomotives back forward.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but this must be done.
And that's why the terminals must have disappeared: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located about half the way from the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe."
The S21 will really be initiated, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer more compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost unpagable to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course do not have any more problems in the entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with driver drive and car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new stretch built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged that.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer rather than the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space, with many green areas, is created, probably from the computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first work to strengthen the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more ecological than that carried out by road trucks.
However, the new sections under construction are good for cargo trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
The experts consider that it is more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other crosses and narrow passages on the net.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 km of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the sentence on the airport.
The federal government leaves the Wiesbaden autonomous parliament pending, if it will appeal to the decision on the ban on night flights of the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU / FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to investigate the VGH ruling of more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of the Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had stated in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned north-west airstrip at Frankfurt airport, the state would have to reregulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, whether to file an appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to give up the appeal to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, called on the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections. Otherwise, this could be taken as a lack of speech.
"It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to fulfill his word," said the head of the green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We do our word."
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federal government would be trying through distortions of law and tricks still get its night flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first quick impression."
"We need a legally indistinguishable decision," Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As the opposition represents, it would never have been his group's claims about the ban on night air traffic.
The US banks return the aid provided.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state ties.
The "Bank of America" once returned the aid provided to it by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the United States CNBC.
With this, the institutes seek to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation of the payment of the bonus to the directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had obtained approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, including for the sale of items.
Bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked American taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the effort to absorb the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to get money on the capital market so that it can free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported a source of known circles, that the US bank could announce by Thursday the increase in its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Rapid election
In the end, everything was faster than we thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative board of the ZDF (German television channel) pressed the editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF's main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this on the part of the station, officially in order not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to damage the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter any more, if this proposal would not be approved by the administrative board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the administrative board already weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument, which under the direction of Brender los informativas del ZDF would have lost ratings of audience.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which he flagged political influence over the ZDF.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had even been involved in the debate, who described Koch's conduct as unconstitutional.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Romanesque politics, pedagogy and philology.
He then worked at the station "Südwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau."
In 1983 it was changed for the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal."
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Green political party announced a constitutional lawsuit after Brender's dismissal, which was still elected on Wednesday as a journalist of the year by media magazine "Medium Magazin."
Koch's opposite in the administrative board, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the staff proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A retreat of politicians in favour of the ZDF control unions was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative board with an intelligent move: he strongly criticized the guild for the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative board was able to vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a sequacious supporter.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded anyway to the left-wing liberals.
University careers are clear.
Partial success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the Länder finally gave way. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor's and master's degree.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of tests: basically each race module should be completed with a single test.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure."
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between universities inside and outside Germany.
The Länder are committed to more flexible elaboration of the structural rules as a whole for the careers of Bachelor and Master.
Reglamentations of the Länder that differ from this should no longer exist.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have been constantly talking about improving the ability to carry out and successfully complete a career (studability).
Now for the first time, a specific content was discussed.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single examination," is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "significant reduction in the burden of tests" is intended to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future, "studability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content should be thoroughly examined in terms of unnecessary student restrictions in the choice of..
the courses.
The students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative."
These rules would be valid for new races, but also for the examination of existing races.
These should be "recredited" again every five years, but this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
The country-wide responsible for this would be 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is installed by the Länder.
The Ministers of Education and Culture called on the Länder in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and the examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
So far only Renania-Platinada has ensured to provide additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counselling programmes, as well as strengthen examination and outside offices.
The Land and the universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single test should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all the races about their "studability."
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of studying in the federal state.
In addition to the praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
In the federal board of directors of the Juso (young socialists) university groups, the design of educational policy should no longer be "behind closed doors" of university ministers and rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, students as the main stakeholders should now be able to give their opinion as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to have access to a later Master's career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future sufficient places of study for Master with the best possible conditions of study. This was reported by a member of the GAW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to deal with a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education made no comments.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically out of control," says the first line of a poem by the lyric Werner Söllner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he fears the experiences of arriving in Germany experienced by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book editorial, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was given several literature awards, in 1993 he gave the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said that he spoke quite a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian Securitate secret service in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In conjunction with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German language prize.
Recruitment attempts had started slowly, early in 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who did not defend himself enough in the face of the attempts to provoke fear of the Securitate," Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for literature was awarded to Herta Müller and his literary controversy unparalleled with dictatorial dominating mechanisms, the literary scene was shaken, and in particular the community of German authors born in Romania for a case that showed the abyss and the evil of a political system, which was based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only the author, but also the victim.
In his Securitate IM Walter file he had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
"I had excused him or defended him at all the difficult points for him," Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the weekly "Zeit," after having read his own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and in some cases know what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the Securitate control files is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and made difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is more of a trace.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, after the Nobel Prize for literature was awarded to Herta Müller, shows that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still quite great. In this interview, a former head of the Securitate de Temesvar spoke deceptively of the decoration.
"She has psychosis," in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turning in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as many times when there are silent blame.
Why just now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession allows us to expect that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's supplier, approached a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the foreign service was elegantly dressed out of a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer would have spread samples.
The bald man had hired a driver, because he still didn't know the city.
Moreover, he could also have been able to drive the car himself: in the end, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reach the octavos in the end," namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3: 1 win against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" was waiting for you on the next Sunday, he said.
It will then be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And remove the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sorting
The final octaves of the Champions League (one-way games on February 16 / 17 and February 23 / 24 / back games 9 / 10 and March 16 / 17) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
So joy was limited by the flashing entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the so-called savior, who in a short time had inspired them to the disconcerted Profis of Stuttgart trust in themselves, willingness to give himself up and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the Gross soul repairer their recipe for success that sounds so simple, but with the therapist Babbel had no effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes up in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a few weeks' pause due to an injury, moved immediately to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes in depth, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
And this is what had been missing, obviously, when Babbel was there.
The VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, says sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, also the players and the administrator refrained from overvaluing the triumph against a defenses weakened by lack of relays and completely overtaken by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen by 0: 4 the sad awakening had come, Khedira thought.
And management Horst Heldt warned that while one target of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt would not want to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were reupdated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by the doorman Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, not Jens, faced Heldt's hard criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached the leadership's weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change his coach by the pressure of the adolescent fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann described him as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the saga.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two quarters.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the replacement coach's team, it would not have been possible to show the great force of play and battle.
Babbel and his attendees had "an important participation in success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World heavyweight championship fight
Fiery duel in Bern: over and over again the challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy weight title in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still a heavy-weight world champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC association beat the American Kevin Johnson on Friday-Saturday night in Bern by unanimous decision by points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko, he was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to make the notation that everyone had expected.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice had to give up due to his injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
In the face of about 17000 spectators in the Bern Sand, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodge over and over again from the world champion's blows, so Klitschko could not decisively lead his dangerous right hand to his goal.
In general terms, the Johnson liability did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely hit the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who held twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the referee had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "can't do anything."
When the weight was done, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he can see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at that time, and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year later, he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez, from Cuba, and Chris Arreola, from the United States, in his defenses of the title.
In this fight I only got a hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after the latter disthroned in November to Nikolai Valujev, of 2.13 meters in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes him is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Front attack of the opposition: the leader of the group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, a liar due to false information about the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - After the most recent revelations about the Kunduz air attack, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for having knowingly misled.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast by the television channel ARD, Green group leader Jürgen Trittin said that the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he said lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Police for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it had been reported that this attack was not only about destroying the abducted trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air attack, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak to the federal parliament immediately and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government's policy of Afghanistan, and whether the chancellery, the army and the information service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the green Renate Künast demanded.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellery had no influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, they also had some doubts about the Ministry's presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
It had been officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials, it went beyond that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report by a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung."
So far, it has not received a reply, it was said.
The ministry did not express itself on Saturday with regard to the reproaches made to it, noting that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Ionic worlds
In a state of vigil, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts do the limits between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during the dream, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhindered ourselves to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience sleep-like states during the vigil, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are most often considered in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drugged.
Our imagination is our fault: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality to be blurred.
Onirically modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most different forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, insanity.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Era prophet Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neural substances of communication in the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholin - has been derailed and interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur.
Gravity no longer has power over it.
The relationship between insanity and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the oniric states," for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the dispurposes, wild formations, and miraculous of it."
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red messes like blood, deformed, reclining their teeth.
They're chasing him, they kick him with heavy, flaming boots, they throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Strident and evil voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. starts two wires from the stereo, ties them to form a hanging knot, and sets them on a hook on the roof.
He goes up in a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope is loose.
May it be a lesson to you, the voices in a chorus that bursts the eardrums, "go to the clinic and make them cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one two years ago, the first one almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, in addition to maniac-depressive, he takes medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of overarousal that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecution mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
Schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning addressed to it.
At the same time it enters into a passive role, as in a dream, it is overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an unknown why our brain makes cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a provisional basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which is also not manifested at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role - stress or traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a prior disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain's transmitting system.
When the brain heats up
The illogical of all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the professor in psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
The perception of hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analysed the results in the book Die irale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as personality limit disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephalic trauma.
in a surprising way and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers from hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain where sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or not cohibited; when our brain is hot, but also when there are no stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other exceptional brain states.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens eimal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haren.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and went to a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it wasn't for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during the recess, it happens that a boy clumsy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers him, the other students look at her with sodomy; no one, besides her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
He's awake and he's going and he's listening to that guy, the same way he sees and hears the girl sitting at the bank next door.
He can even feel his presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he can sometimes not follow the lesson because the teacher - in his eyes and ears - is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to come, which often comes late and is scarce, he does not know whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the grinds or the girl with bleeding cuts to arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she yells at the figures.
He didn't tell his parents and friends anything, they'd think he's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old.
She passed last year's selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have been gone for a year.
Since he's come into contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, he knows he's not crazy.
Crazy is also a work of art out of despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or has a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is out of business and it's the same one looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was in little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he has the use of reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noise impressions, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real. "
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special ability.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences are usually pathologically pathized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhausen hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
The oniric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later cannot differ from being awake.
Onyric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculoneuropathy, who experience a motor paralysis while being completely conscienti. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation by a world of his own and imaginary that is decoupled from reality.
A form of situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way to give meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own capacity of creation allows us not to sink into the nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later on in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his oniric experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to rescue the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several days of travel after a heart valve operation with a heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Clausen immersed himself in a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was prostrated in bed, an older man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching over his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a bike kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with firm snow and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these interior trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so he describes his experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilute the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Each change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten sums up, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come

The children will take over the editorial at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen has come to a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also become in the hands of the family.
Hamburg - Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and are determined to enter the company, said Burda, 69, to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put his children in front of 7,500 workers, if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end the children and also the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the presidency of the board of directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52, has been a member of the management of Burda since 1999.
At first he was responsible for the technology.
Later, he took over the treasury and thus came responsibility for the company's assets. After Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure he also took over direct marketing, the foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the editorial.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Their son Felix, who was currently 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also become in the hands of the family.
With a look at the Schickedanz and Schaefle cases, Burda said that family companies are also not safe from decline: "This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the quest for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the largest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "delusions of greatness," says Burda.
I don't look like a political precept in this country, like Springer was, and I don't want to play with "Time" in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
All that, in a matter of beauty and well-being, you may want, within your reach.
This seems to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai, which is responsible for the laser waxing, Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while you enjoy the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to ride your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a copy of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxion.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most new facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulitis or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'coaches' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by inserting your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And if, after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where they offer rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10: 00 in the morning to 22: 00 in the night.
Varied bins
Christmas is coming and it's never too much to go over the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party locker.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
There's a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It's not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The Endesa power company, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LiVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Electrical Vehicle Implementation Logistics) will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla join the project.
They are the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa power company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular to energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE active.
Zapatero sees' a horizon of tranquility 'for the motor sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish car industry, which, he recalled, is the main exporting sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has undertaken throughout the exercise to support the car sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of the closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The head of the Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the President, this plan has made it possible to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in enrolment, which grew by "40%" in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classical Vehicle Hall will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
In this way, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc can be found among the exhibitors of the pavilion.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
The participating companies will include, among others, Mos and Good Old Times Classics, car sales; Juan Lumberas, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and restoration; or Cochera Classicos, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests on the outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on an enabled circuit outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, he has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system - baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 engine of petrol with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved in its whole.
The finishes, the termination of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Following the set formed by the instrument box and the console we see as Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the one also presented by the Honda Civic.
We can therefore say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the living room, this Japanese compact has more than enough room for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular forms.
The engine's automatic stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre and 150-horse petrol engine and the manual change of six marches.
This engine is a real delight. It is overtaken by its finality, its reduced rumour, its performance and its content.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometres per year should not rule out this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high running comfort and for its content consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
From the standard equipment, especially the RVM, which eliminates the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive internal mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth and 17-inch alloy rims.
In addition, in case of little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive beacons and BASE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact in the category.
It is particularly important for the quality of the materials used, for their behaviour and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometres a year will be able to choose this i-Stop version, associated only with the 150-horse gas 2.0 engine.
The only start of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version - Sportivo.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us high doses of satisfaction every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. covers the sensuality red carpet of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in models as elegant as' sexys' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as sophisticated as it used to, chose a dark "lady."
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see a certain type of attachments or navigate the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of American fame when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has taken out two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of about 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphones already know what it is to have to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately search for a cafeteria with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be operational.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a Ph.D. in physics to understand them and some good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission's repeated earcuts to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have had little to do with a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and with reason.
That a little thing like FonPeek (it's still curious to have Fon's name when it lacks Wifi) gets this kind of fee means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no gauges.
It's a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a life-long purchase option like the one Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
The yellow is, without a doubt, the preferred tone of the first American lady.
If you have already come to Barack Obama's inauguration as US President in a dress and coat of this color, you have chosen the same one to accompany you in, no doubt, the second most important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections - the two times the outfit was composed of three pieces - dress, jacket and coat of the same cloth - and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurio.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the possession of it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with stampede.
The accessories have also varied: green shoes half-heel the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a collected on this occasion, melena releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and work history of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey carried out between 9,737 women aged 15-75 left no doubt about this: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the field of work due to maternity.
The study notes that there are many differences in the beginning of a couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, first start living together, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay living together and motherhood, and have less offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after the beginning of the cohabitation, which increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time of their life path to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed has a lot of influence on motherhood, but less on the timing of pairing, "explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they are married and when they have the first root.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which they are married and at which they have the first child.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average, respectively.
"Another division is established between women according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those at middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child, "Delgado explains.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year on, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of 'Because I am worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, thus joins other famous L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met at the annual award of their awards, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Póquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a thirty X-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the foreseeable and fearable genres (biographical semblance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creative character.
The journey has its excitations and Vicent does not save any sustenance or enlightenment.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and reproductions.
I'll leave you some snapshots here.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, pulsion that I felt without name: pleasure against acidic destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, senseless poetic mood, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted 13 years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre tops of universal literature, which must be climbed on the north wall, from which the best climbers are cleared over and over again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the crazy cry from a bridge by that character in Munich to take his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day he turned to his knees and prayed," Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman. "
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after the hard life the death is pleased."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband normally accepted that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
There has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness. "
On Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to do but go to Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abuse that man's fame to serve him as his own pedestal? "
Cowardly assault
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, an exemplary of a mestiza race, rescued from the pound and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, were kicked by two kicks that left the dog badly injured.
Our indignation is capital because we did not find the fun in a free assault on a small, defenceless animal, which was, by the way, tied.
To this we must add the suffocus that caused a lady to walk quietly and that, when she increased these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at 5: 00 p.m. on a single Tuesday by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt it would be for a lot and not to generate susceptivities, just to make it clear that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to consider it fun to abuse a defenceless animal free of charge that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Festivial together for the use of the helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the hull, mainly among the younger motorists, both companies today reported.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injury or even death in the event of an accident while on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing products that are increasingly safer" and said that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and information actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of two-wheel tyres, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
Sell up the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% over 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to the figures of the employers of the Anfac manufacturers and of the Ganvam sellers.
The good data, which is not obvious, should be put in quarantine, since the reference to which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
As a result, despite the upturn of the last month, the accumulated enrolments over the past 11 months are 40% below the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold in addition to all the vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of light commercials: from cars, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks / chassis.
In addition, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, as although they are also acquired by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
As a result, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation must be added to the restrictions imposed by the closed tap of bank credits.
In the light of this picture and unlike the cars, the purchase aid for 2000E has been very little used.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level of not more than 160 grams per kilometre, the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they again recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency brake aid is already compulsory
As with the ABS brake control and the ESP stability control, emergency brake support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all newly registered cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a lack period is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, by their way of work, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency brake assistant is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's step-on.
But this one doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for Bosch car, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance that the car uses to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four claims with damage to people would be avoided - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is populated.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via a radar or camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps you by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort to the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delays the Opel plan until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the day 8 likely - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, is for each of the points of the plan to have been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM supports having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but takes strength from the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skipper, who is supported by the Russian Converg group.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab by the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and jewel-faced, Porsche's engineers took the Boxster S as their base and managed to get it to thinner no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, first, with the automatic ceiling that has been supplied by one of the canvas with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminium doors such as the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, they were won 7 kilos more; mounting sports baccets another 12 and with light rims of 19 inches, five.
Finally, renouncing the CD-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door-shooters to one of the fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual clutch PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on secondary roads in California, in mountain sections with really revirated tracks
His behavior can only be described as inachable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplomo.
Rather, quite the opposite: we had long not had a model so small and light that, at the same time, it would transmit so much security in the step by curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short run for as long as necessary, until we order him to spray, to brake, to recover and repress his engine...
What we ask you to do, thanks to your address, as communicative as it is necessary, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he will do it with a surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is well achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's bramido, previously released in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from a stop or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we went through with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the potholes well.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in one of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, already in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, of the most fun driving that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl '
Intima de Karl lagerfeld, image of the line Coco Cocoon and 'starlette' occasional of the parades of the 'maison', the singer prodicates her malot face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," it's a "Bag Girl."
The Baskonia gives a victory in Israel
The Labour Fund achieved a brilliant triumph for 82-91 in its visit to the complicated court of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties with which the team of Dusko Ivanovic had, and in this way it is located in the leadership of its group, following the great performance of Mirza Tetovic, which with eight triples scored was the best of its team (29 of assessment).
The Vitorian team was able to supply the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mycov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer to the end to get the victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had much to do with the final triumph.
The game started face to face for the blueberries, which were put from the beginning ahead in the marker.
That the first four baskets of the Vitorians went from the perimeter already made it presagiarized that they had jumped to the Israeli court with their wrists hot.
English and Tetovic were the main artists from 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavese team opted for Barac's inner play and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with fists and applause on the return to which he was home, to continue to expand his advantage to rest (34-43).
Tetovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's' minus six 'assessment already made it presagitate that this was not going to be the best Brazilian night.
But the party, despite being on the road to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that in their court no one wins, and with 'the hand of Elias' squeezing they managed to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellow' turning the light (50-49).
More drawbacks
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but not less dead, needed to spin a couple of games with the right to catch air, and in those came the Mirza Teletovic machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavises went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's did not rush, they defended well, and even though the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost in Greece in the face of the Olympiacos and gave him the lead of the group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the casualties of the drawers, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not scared by the peace and friendship pavilion environment and by the rival's entity, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusian to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the local 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which time an action, conato of fight, between the two American bases Beverly and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the loss by injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez, were tearing the cashiers.
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian alero Linas Kleizas, with its triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible rallying.
The third period was very offensive to the Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, was superior and even even equal the difference of the meeting disputed in Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group's leadership stagger.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last fall of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconvenience the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis's contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when it pressed and given its superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to remount the 81-62 average basketball, 37 minutes, and the Unicaja went out, giving the lead to the Olympians.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Troit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? Calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140. 000 job offers available to Troit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week the application is in operation, the search engine has found that in general the Spanish worker "feels ill paid," explained in a statement the product manager of Troit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Troit of his search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges €45,226 gross per year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish one receives.
In the same way, a driver charges EUR 34,247 per year in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Troit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by that of a dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of an operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs in the network over the past three months are that of driver, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President is to leave diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010, when he or she would officially complete his or her term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to seek another destiny."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said via telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya claimed that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the condition of political asylum that the "de facto" government that chairs Roberto Micheletti was trying to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be missed since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchase and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar at close to zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have almost ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they start to put some sand on the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterogeneous measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
The Volatility of the Bags and the differentials of the corporate bonds have repointed, although they remain far away from the paranormal levels that they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, leading to an extension of the differentials of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a further downward review of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence the defenders of moral risk who were again trying to raise awareness of those responsible for global economic policy for having stopped the destructive effects of the credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving day.
However, the Dubai thing paints a tribal struggle among the emirs to reestablish power in the emirates and that of Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro country to breach its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of the transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within what is expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt differentials expand just like European corporate bonds, we must not worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review up their 2011 scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, they return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not give rise to much life expectancy at their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, driver friend."
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommission of the Congress of Deputies in which these days the energy strategy of Spain is discussed over the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few strokes of what he had put forward in the subcommission in private.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another EUR 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 90 billion.
In the next decade, Iberdrola believes that investment should not be used to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue is changing and the power will have to be increased.
Its commitment is focused on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide and, above all, renewable energy capture mechanisms.
In this case, he considers that 18,000 MW new are needed, that is, with other "support energies."
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the Government has just passed is in line with what its company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "specific" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galan believes that investment decisions, although in the long term, must be started as they are late in maturing and a stable pay framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus' handling 'at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for the airport services on the ground, Swiss Swissport, will play the role of preferential partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for the services of cargo at ten European airports where it has presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, of which economic terms have not been exceeded, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a cooperation protocol to create the Centre for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructure
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% is for Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Act your first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
He is fighting for his first concession highway in Australia, where he already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1,7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
French Bouygues and German Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a road construction and dealership.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After choosing public-private collaboration (PPP) to move the project forward, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their submission next May, the planned investment is $1.7 billion (€1.047 billion) and in the last phase three consortia with a significant presence of European builders compete.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish in liza, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues, plays against the team.
The third and last consortium that has passed the crib is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it has a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Billionaire assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has an outstanding presence through its activity as a energy provider and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind park, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of lifting and managing the Adelaide desalination, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies in order to enter the fields of infrastructure construction and operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Infrastructure Office of the city of Brisbane and called the Northern Link (north link), is called to join the western highway of Towong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 km of tunnel. This is the biggest action to reduce congestion in the traffic of Brisbane.
The schedule marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would be open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per sense, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute $500 million (€308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear significant fruit to Hochtief, who reported yesterday obtaining a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The participation by ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide rapid Internet access to 400,000 people and will give German work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to be started and Hochtief has closed the sale by 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, in Manchester in particular, you will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 km in length for a highway of Slovenia of 64.5 million euros.
The firm gets this contract days after the construction of the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in building tunnels.
The start of the work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Mrs. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that presented themselves to the competition called by Renfe of which four were final, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Fit of 63 million to France Télécom for stopping competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a repeat.
Application store
In addition, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed the wake of other operators and has opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing the revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange application store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça from its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992 / 1993 season, according to UEFA data.
The Real Madrid and the F. C. Barcelona have been well stopped from this distribution.
The white club has been the third in the continent to have paid the most money to participate, and the only one, next to the AC Milan, that has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the late European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the ranking.
The list is led by Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams that, in addition, more money billed for the participation of the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body that chairs Michel Platini plans to enter the Champions League.
Of this money the UEFA will devote 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round of classification (including the Atletico de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they fight.
There are also bonuses to be won (800,000 euros) and to be tied (400,000 for each team). The octavofinalists will receive three million each; the eight quartofinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be billed 4 million each.
The champion will earn 9 million, compared to 5.2 million finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million for winning the Supercup of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main places, with four places assigned.
The champion of the previous year has 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games that are played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The group Nueva Rumasa has broken down yesterday the details of the offer of purchase of shares with which it aims to acquire a ceiling of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for all of the titles.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share that would be disbursed over 10 years and that would be paid with an interest for this 1% annual postponement
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed to 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 counselors.
The Jerezano group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to report their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV claimed not to have been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the company of the Ruiz Mateos stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If made, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of purchase and of the judicial vaivies of its former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a new post that will depend directly on the group's president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company is still in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will unravel new misflows of funds
With regard to the credit to the Salazar, former members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared yesterday in the National High Court that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorises the Pternine exclusion cup that Inversora Mer presented
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion option presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms are in accordance with the rules in force and by considering "sufficient" the content of the explanatory brochure submitted following the amendments made on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to negotiation in the Bags of Madrid and Bilbao.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been frozen, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions in force.
New tools for losing cars
In these days of temporary and accident, not only do the car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No sinister is the same, and the calculation of part costs and labour time can be a long and complicated work.
The cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including workpieces, can be calculated manually and can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent computer tools it would be a matter of
Therefore, almost 100% of the experts use these types of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for the valuation of claims and maintenance are engaged in collecting the information provided to them by manufacturers, and are then prepared and offered to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the assessments are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of assessment and information-processing tools for the sector are GtMotive and Euromax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the extent that in the last five years versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as a new car comes to market, these companies get to work.
It is a very hard work, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and its price introduced.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be "pinched."
If it's a window model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes too fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that runs, they exceed 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audatex has eight centres spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million per year in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer different products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for the management of scrapping parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports the value of the used in Spain is Euromax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products that Audatex offers it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution for the valuation of claims, intended for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint pliers.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which makes thousands of assessments, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and of the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass is concentrated on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaAbastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to bid for the vehicles declared total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or knowing the deviations by omodelum marks.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop because of failures or how many have suffered serious injuries in a given period.

Internet-based suicide of accidental cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scraps and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.

Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search the replacement, create budget and generate budget.
Easy use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less likely to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 SUV, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with an Internet connection is required to use it.
Once the model has been identified to be repaired by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, recharges or discounts, and then you can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaWorkshop is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
The company Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
