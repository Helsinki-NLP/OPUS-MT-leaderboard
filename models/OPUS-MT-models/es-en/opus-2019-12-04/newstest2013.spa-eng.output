A Republican Strategy to Bway Obama's Re-Election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers this to be a myth and states that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die from the fall of lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is true: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that regard, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments have enacted, since 2009, new laws that make it difficult for the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread following the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit an identity document with a photograph, in addition to an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit an identity document with photography.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana law.
That is why the Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo identity document.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identity documents issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity card costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people who earn less than $35,000 per year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photo identity card.
And there's still more.
In many states students, electors who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo identity document issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who often vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required a citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, the Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to assist voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the rate of registration of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favoured the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the exact same thing happened.
They represent only 11 per cent of the voters, which is equal to 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, which account for 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law that required the submission of an identity document with photography.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A report from the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is true: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this regard, the measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: Do the test or not do it to you?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reticent of themselves, doubt whether or not the screening tests should be done.
Do the test or not?
We've asked for advice from two specialists.
Studies in the United States identified a high rate of contagies among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who had not.
The study, with a 12-year follow-up, also showed that there are between 30 and 40% possibilities of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are painless.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of his cancer. He should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not harm life in the long term, in which case more should be chosen for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been detected with cancer are not treated, as such cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer them treatment.
We increasingly identify precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of the cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would be at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Society against Cancer.
On the other hand, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for other cancers.
It greatly distorts people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after you stop smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is halved.
The weight
Gordura and obesity also favour the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they increase the risks of colorectal cancer.
Chartering products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting may cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the time being, their investigations are not conclusive.
According to SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer was observed, in another what was seen was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of each with his or her doctor.
"Taking the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not entirely clear that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it is much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data are still missing to be completely secure.
However, we assume that this is about Higgs, as the chances of being wrong seem to be few. We will see what this is about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because it will end up getting hurt.
Although the physics of the particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the principle of the exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, grossly, of some of its characteristics.
Physics classify the particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we meet the good citizens called fermiones, who are wise to obey at the beginning of Pauli.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not speak here, and the "force particles," by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it could be emphasized here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave is born (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosons "carrying force."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "messy" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is far more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, it takes extremely high energies, a little as if it were an ice-cream pond in which only a thick rock could slide down the surface.
This is why a huge particle accelerator such as CERN (the great Hadron collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) is needed to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do do have a mass, while the rest (as the photon, by the way) do not.
But what "can they bring" all these investigations, asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to vote on the differences between observations and predictions of MS.
For their part, many fervently want them to be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, such as that it does not propose any explanation concerning gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of such research on our day-to-day is difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong to say that it will have none.
For you to see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution that their work would provoke.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked at Bell's laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who produced the first continuous laser (the first were pressed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory device."
Imagine...
And also, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself produced a light collector in 1969 in the course of his research on optics.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this captor now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which was worth the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon while a bill was being prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment at the Montégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year break.
"I had been given five years of life, but I have already been seven," he says, made a pass, lying in his bed in the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he goes on.
The disease has caused her havoc: a huge weakness that prevents her from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on her own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resignation to help him eat.
Brave, he even comes to smile, to talk to the strangers who care for him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured by diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy to that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
To return to their childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I have no more desires in this life," he says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for a last visit from your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, as we know we'll all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying are offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled for their sugar rate.
Death is part of the daily.
We served a beer last night to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, your son ran out of beer at the dead man's feet.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor-Gadbois the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savors his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age who are cancer-sick," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care designed to alleviate suffering when a sick person reaches the final stage of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care centre.
And several organisms, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal's home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative lack in Quebec's health care that causes many doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," he says, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pain without having done what is necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients wish to die only because they do not receive adequate care. "
And in parallel, many oncologists are hindering with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that she wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was very sorry that she wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me that there was nothing else to do!"
There's no all-powerful care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die thank their caregivers who have not met them in their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care at home of Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until his or her death, either sporadic or permanent.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
The implementation of this report has been made possible by a journalism grant from the health research institutes of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia have, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system," of which are part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
An "industry" that was too expensive for the Québec taxpayers, especially in the years 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how the system is pulverized once we have hunted the big media," ironiza Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Parliament in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the liberal Prime Minister of that time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, the clandestine financing of parties and corruption between officials.
"Since the beginning of the research in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while he hopes to be able to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government reporters, researchers and analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the "Marteau squadron" police, which, since 2009, have made the "sewer cartel" in Montreal moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has recorded in series the charges of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of an outlying city.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vailancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been paid in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accura and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the Commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a Mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money to the right and wrong during the years 2000, giving over 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing a collection of illegal funds for the former liberal vice-prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewer contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs inflated.
Other road network staff have admitted that they received money for inflating the invoices by 30 to 40 per cent as false extras.
In addition, a party organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected policies in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to the promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money in the election campaigns was dirty money.
From the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she pulls "from a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits."
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning the wounds but it would take a clean research unit in Montreal and to be very alert so that dubious practices do not repeat themselves.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is particularly concerned about the role of the 'elected politicians who are aware of the stratagem. "
By estimating by 70% the proportion of dirty money that was allocated to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I have been told that this is only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebequese government proposes to limit party donations to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "until the election costs are strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It calls for a complete review of the system of granting public contracts and financing the parties: "We cannot fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story soaks the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
I move forward from day to day by his side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't get heated.
From my beginning at the INF Clairefontaine pre-formation center to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced at a speed of steps.
He's going to get a profit from the competition that Carlo Ancelotti recruited.
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
It's backed by attachments like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technicians.
Today, there is no one the same in League 1 and is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with big players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away our position as leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our greatest goals is the League of Champions: we have been classified for the top octaves with style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our league in front of the Port so that we can receive the return of the octave in the end.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is given to its means for this project to be implemented.
Not winning the Cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
In the last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
I think this year will be the good one.
Even if great teams like Marseilles, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it to us.
Do you think the media expect more from the PSG?
It's normal for them to expect a lot from us if we think about what's been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, they still find things that reproach us is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to start a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the League of Champions we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, which, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the eighth in the end, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the amounts invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be to neglect our adversaries and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseilles, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
We better say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he puts in many goals.
He's here to prove that he's the star of League 1.
And he's shown on all the teams he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live the 2012 Eurocup with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I got reinforced.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
It's what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus."
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and this is because we have exemplary behaviour today.
What's your vision of Didier Deschamps's first month in front of the bleus?
He's getting results.
They are well located in the World Cup classification group.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocup.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as is often the case in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc., and a safe exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows file exchange to be equal to the same.
Some 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The contribution of the bitcoin, after having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning to the ten dollars today (the contributions are censored on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual coins such as "credits," used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be bought (and even at times exchanged).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both accountancy book depositaries, verifiers, currency emitters, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes are recorded in the public account book, which is spread throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add that complementary line.
This is a process of file chopping, that is, of transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical print.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chopping" the set.
The aim is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would become orphan, as both have different prints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, likely by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the ninetieth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The failure used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes account of the potential for money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, like the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Insite in Israel, analyzed the book of accounting and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant rebates" were launched.
"$30,000 was changed," Jon Holmquist rejoices, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile non-contact payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to put into operation in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or softwars.
It is enough for them to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to review hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to impose, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
In addition, in its report the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event that this currency is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have especially punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if the jihadists, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbecos or the Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by the helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was wrapped in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants over the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old Mujahidines, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making government land to resell them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the combination of huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million people, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
Those young people who would not want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders would have to be given work.
All, including the armed opposition, are avid of mobile phones. Television and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world have great fans all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned to reconstitute the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, removing the post of the Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country had been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been fixed, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a ruined country after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth expanded.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take over them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Month Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, will also need to re-establish their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls & apos; schools, children & apos; s schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to perform the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions match, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
These work, which is to obtain local labour, has been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, solar protection and increase of growing areas.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military expenditures?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very harsh in these valleys often at more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
If they are to be free from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid that comes directly to them.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisional full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given that Assembly another two months to complete its work.
And Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial havoc.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persevere in his "autocratic delirium" and continues "betraying his word" and "trampling on the right."
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a step towards a faster end to the institutional and political crisis and an acceleration of the transition process.
A referendum should be organized in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimization while the controversial causes havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Since this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either my text is voted on or I maintain full powers," powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, the vast majority of them Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be achieved, 11 people, replacement members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As was to be expected, the articles voted on had been unanimously.
The fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed almost at the time of prayer is funny to the commentators, on the other hand, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the subject of all the views, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law was a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules," which would have made it possible to apply more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals have made him hypocrisy and believe that it is nothing more than an advertising ruse.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who is to confirm its conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing that "people called to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy. "
The fears of the liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of the university would be quite less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil status.
Most jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university, some of them formed in the French system, "explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic case law, ndlr].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule above all this. "
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday received many criticisms concerning the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflictive point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the review of the defence budget shall not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, the insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to be on TV last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this noon.
The head of State's supporters showed up on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine.
The promised Earth combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"IDA" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the conversion of water to wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasing of the storm and the full nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are found in Jerusalem.
Believers are here on the Viacruces or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the judgment was carried out, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Untion and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Latitudes; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 DC.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will then come true.
Make a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what was left of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in the year 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who are engaged in climbing can.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
As far as there, bus services are available from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly there were pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On one trip you won't be able to visit them all.
But it's worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rollos of Qumrán, discovered in the caves of the Judea desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It's worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition he has canvas of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bathroom Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and bathers from that time.
In Cesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
Entry is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall from 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who can't swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salted water, brine and healing bars and to fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to order their broken nerves.
Playing the mysteries of antiquity
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed through the famous maritime route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk the narrow streets that bear the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph.
And in Cesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre, "take" the strength of the Crusaders.
In the Roman era, Cesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Poncio Pilato.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shéquels (currently 1-3 $, 8 shéquels).
The urban transport is mainly made up of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City to the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travel on any type of public transport costs 6 shéquels and for this price you can travel by transshipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to the sunset of Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport stops their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a variety of sauces, the phalafel, which are ground garbanzo balls, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who "walk at their liking" in an impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The snorers love the crowded places and do not reject the candy.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to the insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bike will go for 15 shéquels a day.
Entries to museums cost an average of 30 shéquels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The majority of those who came to visit the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% higher than the 2010 rate, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
As Members of Parliament and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, they have already appeared in the country on the basis of "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of countries in Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force, according to which each working immigrant must conduct an examination to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, the examinations will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to carry out the examination of the language, but also the examination of Russian history and the basis of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian was the official language were the exception.
Persons who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will be sponsored by the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of People's Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to run for tests in all cities, and now in Russia more than 160 such centres are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask this question to the press: What will this really bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery."
Many people are talking today about defending the rights of labour immigrants, explains Víctor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will enable the problem of immigrant workers to be solved in 90 per cent of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a creepy and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," says the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajik Immigration Service, Tolib Sharif.
Don't get mad, you little cunt!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbecos, Tajik can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, wearing them and buying them what they need for school.
When they get to adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first chance.
It's difficult, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have such status, there will be no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only a thousand five hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and there are cases of extortion.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told the journalists.
"Come on, don't be cheap, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it became clear that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
To date, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the examination the first time longer to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigorously in relation to the owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: to fire during wedding celebrations where there were no victims, and to the massacre initiated by the Muscovita lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Apretar seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to raise the minimum age for obtaining a licence to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms to the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-hand policy."
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such "senseless" measures be desist.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, he said to the news service BBC of Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of 2012, 142 offences were committed with the use of firearms registered with internal affairs bodies, compared with the total of 1168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the civil weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked at the Ministry of Education and the High General Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts weapons orders
The first, "vestige of the army or military," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officials and by the same Caucasians," says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapon," the ones stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those directly stolen by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
There were often explosions in many military arsenals.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the lack," one former military member said.
According to Baranets, the weapons manufacturers also put their little grain of sand.
"Private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market have now proliferated and are distributing sane weapons to the black market, including that of Moscow," the expert says.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for problem analysis and governance planning.
The specialists analysed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal literature and public access data of portals whose theme is about weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the weapons in the black market have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to investigators, 17 per cent of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 per cent are stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent are "illegal archaeology."
The dependent of one of the arms stores, who asked for his last name not to be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been purchased for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"He takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two loaders," he tells us
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the matters, so periodically, when you have to comply with the crime discovery plan, they are making evidence purchases to the illegal arms traders," he adds.
"Like a luxury boutique."
The seller and the buyer are often found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me went to the" Begovaya "platform, where I would be a man who would take me to a" little party "where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out only there. "
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
There are sellers in the markets, but there you also have to get there, say "on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I'm not gonna give him up.
The rookies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was no "everything."
"I felt like a luxury boutique," the military remembers.
The buyer, according to the words of Baranets, is not offered cat by hare: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential client, do not just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the gun shoots well, we start to negotiate," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofas shop
The web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte," where you offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the ad "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
There users ask their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"I buy TT gun. Moscow," laconically asks your question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures those who want to buy firearms in two hands.
And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia.
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: the website is usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to let you know where the weapon is hidden," says NGO press secretary "The Right to Arms," Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an order is made online, you run out of a gun and put him in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures those who want to buy firearms in two hands.
"And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms," a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
One and a half months should be expected.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranking chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared with the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which is 22,900, and the number of cases identified for the theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are on strike
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as ATMs at "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests against the low wages paid in Walmart's supermarkets and restaurants in popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken," has been launched in the United States.
For now no one dares to claim whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose strength and to be amused in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, it coomenzated the orgy of rebates that captured millions of people, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protest picket with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's shops, whose products target people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in your shops are between 8 and 27% cheaper than those in the largest supermarkets.
That's why many underpaid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because he pays little to his workers.
The latter also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this is too much, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart's supporters are satisfied that the protest took place in only nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in their shops from 8: 00 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their register boxes made the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been only "another public relations trick," organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city have no appreciation for them, and so for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one makes less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it's something incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few were the ones who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble into some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them with.
The participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 on Thursday morning at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that ATMs and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, that is, to double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded the establishment of workers' unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing trade union activists with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discording
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular Jumane Williams City Council member, who said, "McDonald's says he's selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example the city's candidate for mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support fast food workers so that they can get fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorkino deserves."
As the New York Times described, this has been the largest manifestation of this type in American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy."
The issue of increased reality, so popular among the fans of modern technologies, is recently seen with normal mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was found that for the company's scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We are dedicated to the person-computer interaction, but we also try to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as all are interested in control by gestures.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
The world of computer science must be released to our, to the physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, fuck those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you cannot be considered a panacea, it remains to be resolved the question of privacy, as you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not of loose movements, but of shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device's camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a bracelet watch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- You mean, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good in-depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have from modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the issue is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
So, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
It is also important the speed, the number of tables per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern series-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work to have an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact for the tables per second to be more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras," one of which is in fact the infrared transmitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible diapason sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
On the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the daily use of increased reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smart phone up in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could move from the glasses to the smart phone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man," but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that the increased reality is the seventh eruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Search the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangability to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is found gives a feeling similar to that that one feels if someone is blowing it into the yolks of the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To make him think that he feels what he seems to feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gymnastics), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, we still have to work for many years.
That's what makes work attractive with virtual reality for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardismo de Saint Petersburg," dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, to the vanguard of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of St. Petersburg in the late '80s - the early' 90s.
He is also an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises all the mood.
Recently, he took into his hands an organillo and became the organillero of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his existence bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you in the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I do the look and the image.
In this world, red color is a commitment between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little grey is a cause of aggression and agitation of ungood properties.
But my provocations are meant for a conversation to begin.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand you were supposed to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was shown.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free as I did, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with those after those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10," and the new wave is over.
I joined the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
And all this got together in your art clinic... it was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemia of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's ear."
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of their great career; basic education and training received it from us.
"D 137" Gallery, the "Griboyedov Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and our customers went.
I'm a hero from the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was made in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable about your jobs.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which the present and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum on Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns, everything is skewed and tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by the clothes, being oriented on the outside, but not inside the person.
And, maybe that person is not even owed his hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
We recently saw you in the role of an urban organizer, a cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Good, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
The people used to be grouped into flocks, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simplons.
Now all have been divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please all.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to all of you to like.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov arrive for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, the sex-social sphere works there.
And to a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 people will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to spoil what you've achieved.
When I was young I made such pictures that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is one concept: official of culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
When the kings were the right ones everything was otherwise, the kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are now very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level that properly evaluate them and open their way.
Now the subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same thing, Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is inimical.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board leave in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of ingravity or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with flora began to be addressed.
It has been half a century since plant experiments were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were nothing different from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosyllids.
In 1979, codorniz eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of ingravity.
We get a normal chicken as a result.
But then the problems start.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
By not finding support, the chicks gave random flippers.
And after 10 hours in the newborns, a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychev said about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatelite "Bion" they will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatelites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," Vladimir Sychev says.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
The Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years now.
The greatest risk was passed by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say, if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first Cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second Cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We are few, we are numbered the astronauts to whom after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov, sums up.
However, humanity must seek some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabyrinth of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
In conditions of zero floating, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
The water simulates the ingravity.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, but still hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The small amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the time of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if ingravity is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation is necessary, the strength of gravity.
In the ingravity of the abdominal and pelvis muscles, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced very quickly.
Well, we missed that, trusting the action of labor stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?," Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress in a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing a child to be born in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally unfit person," the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov, previews.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
NKU Chief: The "švarc" system inspection has not hit the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is consistent.
This is said by Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (NKU) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This, in my opinion, is what we lack," thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDO (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother employers with inspectors. So, is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls or to demand obligations," Kala says.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which the legislation concerning public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public awards are to be organised, which is followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by the practice itself.
We have joined everything and, although the control has not yet ended, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "tighter and more complete," however, the concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more and more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely a common control of this kind that could help us to stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, the reduction and the improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The savings economy means to get a thing right at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of awards means that we are going to make it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork," that those who want to look for system failures will be able to do it more easily than if the limits were kept as high as now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation governing the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized otherwise?
As for the offices, such as the NKU, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with a similar organization to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level, in this respect slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to establish a comparison without concrete data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be precise what it is best for.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of the inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make this kind of comparison.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If not, it would be no benefit for them to work with our office, wouldn't it?
As for the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean for your Office? Is it in any way manifest its impact?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been expressed in the control proceedings.
As we carry out ex post controls, there is a need for some delay.
For the time being, it is noted in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks," through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar are rectified.
Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is probably a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that may arise is that the rules "tighten" and that it is impossible to comply with them.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each unrespected law on public procurement meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path is taking us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system "prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office which has the obligation to carry out such controls and to demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we'll do anything.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how to act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded because he does not meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
The roads have ice plates, although they are mostly transitory
In several parts of the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most of the pathways are transient, in some, caution must be extreme.
Karlovy Vary region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transient, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature goes down and will range from five to ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is fine.
On the other hand, in the crest of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still bad because of the fog, according to information from the regional road control centre.
The R6 fast track and the first-class road in the region are now transitory without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to extreme caution, especially in some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
In addition, all second and third-category roads, including mountain roads, are also transportable.
However, in some of them there are still sections with traces of ice and snow.
There is a need to increase attention on the road, particularly in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of ice cream and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports on its pages the Directorate of highways and highways.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates being formed, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can occur in the vicinity of Lanskroua, Ustí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
The I / 43 and I / 34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Krkonoše mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow in the higher areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of the eastern Bohemia, the sky will today be between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range from three under zero to a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitory this morning, although caution must be increased and time adapted.
In the early morning hours there will be frost, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent fall in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will find themselves in fog, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is the result of information from the regional road operations control centre.
The D5 motorway is transitory almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to extreme caution, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most of the first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road border with Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so, in this case, it is also warned of sections with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less-traveled routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will find partially dried snow.
After chemical treatment, snow was still left in the port of Červenohorské and in the way to Videlský kříž.
The road operators removed the snow during the night; on the Šumper road about three centimeters of snow were accumulated, according to the road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transitory without restrictions.
"In the higher areas of the Šumper road, remains of snow remain.
The drivers in the port of Červenohorské will find half-snow cast in the direction of Jeseník, "has confirmed today an operator of the road management from Šumper to the ČTK.
On the ground and at night, his colleagues also went to the Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are transitory without restrictions, on that of Šternberská the drivers should drive with caution on the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Ustí nad Labem region and Liberec region
Road operators in the north of Bohemia have reported complications in different sections first thing in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or ice cream, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ustí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lower areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain on the road. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been reported from the memo.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day, rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavorable conditions have been announced from the general roads on I / 13, on the border between the Ustí nad Labem and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just under a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to hold on to.
The Tap Tap music group rather likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organized a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-owned charity that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21 at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20 at 21: 00, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
It was initially my idea, then we were all building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keyboards against the end of the world that can be acquired at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, together with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is entitled "End of the world, cancelled."
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at the charity concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the interpreters at the same time at the three concerts.
The hymns will link together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charitable events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised at the concerts against the end of the world be allocated to?
To equipment for the school without barriers Studeo, we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
The students of the Jedličkův ústav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
A number of groups and interpreters are present at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will be performing for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalists, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of persons with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as hard as it can look at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which still surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything came out smoothly.
Through the exits abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still not common for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Luckily, a civil association had been established that was working to tematise the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what aspects should we take the example of more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're going through behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people to whom it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to move on their own in public and to be able to go to the service, the museum, wherever you want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will start to change everything really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to engage in something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Láņa Angelovič says, we got a little out of hand (laughter).
However, popularity did not come until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that we were quite helped by connecting with famous singers and also working actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that you can do something else.
The world of show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we must have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it's not just a step forward for them, but for the whole society.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you, help?
If we want to do a job of quality, we have to be rigorous in many ways and demand a certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they find out they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and at concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Just one: Láł a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has will and will will will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 a.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect to the end of the evening through videoconference to jointly sing the song of The Tap Tap Group "End of the World, Cancelled"
The purpose of the concert is to gather the resources necessary to finance the multi-functional equipment of the STUDEO school without barriers in Jedličkův ústav of Prague, the cost of which is CZK 25 million.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry in the early sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries last week, Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, where, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics."
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics."
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of the cosmonautics, known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he named one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
In 1925, a dresin was built in Poland and was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal was not known, nor were the project's highlights known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresin or for its braking.
The information about this dresin is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to engage in missiles.
The research was funded by the Komorka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the investigation reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietopuerto lotnicza," by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile techniques projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies on the cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the magazine problemy, reference is made for the first time to the society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, of Prof. M. Subotowicze, he proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to the cosmonautics.
By that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) had been seeking to become part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became the Vice President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the MRI (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and air tests of the RM-2 two-stage rockets in the Błędów desert began in summer 1959.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum apogee in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was later built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined in the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social trade law.
The resolution aroused a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the existing problem from a broader point of view.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less regulatory competition.
This therefore means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (of wages) leads to economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "causes a fall" in the competitor's price with the aim of getting the majority of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale, for most employers, it means moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and thus is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the state's social expenditure necessarily increases.
This whole situation is conducive to the total lack of interest of employers in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so universally known that there is no need for specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the Governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictate of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the limited right of employees to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with the widening gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years now, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid already reaches a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: people employed on such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of almost all the states of the south of the EU certainly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to migrate as in the 19th century or to be malnourished with a terrible wage on the edge of society, in the hope that one day they will reach the private investment capital country.
Do you have to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty then goes from country to country or never comes, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African continue to work for a small part of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media say to the satisfaction that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that leading the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence the political march and, therefore, the entire state with its selfishness.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that is manifested in the area of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is almost unlikely everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, charge the drafting of bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to industry.
These types of bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that the democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like the one that Appiános describes in his work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeya: "The state had been disintegrating for a long time and the administrations were working hard."
In exchange for bribes, illegally obtained favors and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and people went to the polls with the vote beaten in advance... "" there were no people with a character who would aspire to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls... "" He began to speak seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a strong man... "Although Appiános thought of Pompeya, Caesar came to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, just as in old times, is that today's society is based on unconsidered preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, able to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal-type democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution, at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could," Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus says "Let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my children did not want war, there would be no Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged as always.
One, on the Israeli side, argues for the right of self-defence and encapsulates the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and acts as a terrorist state against Israel.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the massacres that are repeated on a regular basis and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginning of the violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who takes advantage of the tensions that have been taking place for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small surface of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have come to on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of the struggles for power is in the front row.
At every time we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who led their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a particular objective.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world into the hands of a few individuals and that at this concentration of money and the power that this implies, it has not been possible to reach in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there's still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't rule out): the Rothschildren.
You don't write much about them.
Naturally.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have important shares in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gadafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has made the central bank subject of the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschild Central Bank of America, began during the Secession War to print money and was killed in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
His desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third aimed to reduce the population of the land by half a million to one billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so much resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary draft for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschild, operates follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the murder of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo, and after the first World War was triggered, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiably from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflict situation following the huge war repairs imposed on Germany, creating the best conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, they were sufficient to serve the Germans the solution of the Fuhrer, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to the culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that was to represent and so well represented the function of the fifth column, which set the flame and the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the former Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to the Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration laid the foundation for the massive immigration of Jews into Palestine and began the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which international bankers had it tied in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the best conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which the war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers were to get it started, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the first line of combat, now together with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only in the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how the sympathizers and detractors of Israel are divided in a tacit way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz, where it passes 20% of all world oil (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light is now shown the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-suited financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his or her whole being.
"And it forces all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on the right hand or on the front, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand: whoever has two fingers in front, may add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six. "
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throwing the shah overboard could not be allowed, since, if it did, it would jeopardize the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified further with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck tempered an episode of this story, which made a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated break, they ended up at the Canadian embassy residence.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping a hidden story an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan drawn up by the "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
The Affleck film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper motion," the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film, the mood is combined. On the one hand, we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits, we show emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were made in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this respect.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA and other institutions: men brought in who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has no longer been the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Adios mino, Adios" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Robbers" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "runs" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy's take is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of the disconcertation and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictitious scenes (the impostor team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he gets along pretty well. Sometimes he adds something to reality: here it doesn't all go out in such a elegant way (the scene in which the crisis is haunting at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind his track become crazy).
The weakness of Argo is the discontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, the Affleck film loses a little dramatic, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, that's gonna be hard.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omnisscience of secret services can be, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflating of balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey of the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop."
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a quota of 40 percent of women in leadership positions in large European companies," said Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organizer.
Among the proposed absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women were at better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other amazing ideas of the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, damage the environment; another prohibition is the use of life-long mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive shines the size of the hens cages, which has contributed to the significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual ban on the use of the term "untar butter" or the removal of the classical light bulb from the shops has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under the pressure of one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not have "abnormal curvatures."
The European Commission argued that this only seeks to harmonise non-homogenized national rules to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules that refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU's prescription last year according to which in the inflatable balloons that are placed on the market it is mandatory to notice that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
There is also a similar restriction applicable to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious events are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum quantities of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for preserved mushrooms, which posed a threat of a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
This kind of idea did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage for the fact that we have no sea.
We asked the European Union for compensation, "said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the fall of 2004.
He argued this with the fact that there was a lot of cereal produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the stores full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was ready to assist the Czech Republic and organized a public competition for the purchase of cereal from countries that did not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development, led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the target of criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and, in addition, more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which the Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czech people are also involved in sensitive fibre, as are other countries of the Union, in the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even though our country has not always been victorious of these fists.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the name of origin of the Olomouc recess, but had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was called "tuzemák."
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known worldwide, the mazapan of the German city Lübeck or the Parma ham, for example, are the Karlovy Vary cookies, the Pohořelice and Třeboł tent and even the variety of hops of Žatec.
As EU protected maras, you can be proud of Pardubice ginger bread and Hořice v Podkrkonoší bays.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how did you come up with the presidential election?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it was all right in our country, then I wouldn't put up my candidacy.
But I can no longer stand to see how it is stolen in our country in the last 20 years, how the thieves go unpunished, taxes and retirement age are increased.
He had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter it has set out on its way to the presidency.
Are you not turning your back on those people who have voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results of the Senate elections.
I later stated that if I was elected a senator, I would apply for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trampled on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is in addition to the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said from me that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over 20 million.
To do this, it must change the law.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to figure it out?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the guide to be recognized as a self-employed job, and we have done so.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, either right or left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential for obtaining the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without party encasillations or dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and to apply it.
Is he more of a right-wing or left-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.
It doesn't matter to me, either a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we get ahead of ourselves.
I don't care if anyone's right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas.
You're kidding when you're said to be a populist.
But you're not proving it with what you're saying?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain objectives and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or well-known experts speak of them.
But without the support of Parliament, they only have the slogans.
And this cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address and talk to people, you will, for example, get criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to do so.
If he was elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to report why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character that points to disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let us take on a case-by-case basis the direct election of the President, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I claim that I'm just an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I just started politics and I'm trying to get the most support for my program.
I'm trying to get things out of the way myself, but in case it doesn't go well, in six years, I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light the frauds with light heating oils.
I showed up on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the balance.
Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the senate we are two from the independent sector.
People chose the senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check out the indistinguishable past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have any money.
I have no money for the campaign to the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 kroner.
You don't have any money?
He's talking about property statements, what's yours like?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a floor valued at 10 million, another floor valued at 8 million, a collection of works of art valued at 10 million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at 1 million, and on the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant to women and, at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go to debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that there is not too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money in my pocket.
The campaign costs cover in essence what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I could not live from it. For example, I could not pay my son for the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner per month.
If I wanted to just make money, then I wouldn't stand as a candidate.
So you'll continue your business to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to stop this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People would want it to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How often do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I still win.
If I was president, then I'd leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently finished "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and at last there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a bystander passing the street.
And Stefan Spermon, a IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is nice."
But I wonder why we need a library these days.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one gets into those old-fashioned libraries for good, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, has the dubious honor of having set itself up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this disgraceful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and to copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated armed concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how policy-makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a whole master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings at the same time cynical, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'. "
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain rises at the planned location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and townhouse buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012."
In this way, the small city without history, which to date had nothing to offer but a post-modern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall after whose white façade one would rather intubate a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a quesera.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the recessed brick floor and the elegant lanterns unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up you can see the park banks, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, and more books.
"The bookshelves are usually arranged along the facade and in the center a huge dark room is opened which is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to turn up the classic spatial configuration and get the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well taken advantage of: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention should be made of the black shelves that assume the functions of wall, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more daily shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that's how one day, on a frieze farm, we run into the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a low-millimeter plastic fabric has been used as a basis for holding the roots of the crops.
This is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until it got plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sport slipper.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain we have the reward: from the cafeteria you have not only a fantastic view of the city, but also a tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere at the same time that maintain the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is difficult to believe, given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located in a cross-sectional direction to the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the rays of the sun.
This creates a comfortable inner climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there, too.
Chinese traditional medical teacher Cynthia Bogarde has also visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul."
The reason is that, on the occasion of the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its full file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," said architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link to this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if I'm just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved complete success in this discipline, which reigns that in the specialized argot is known as "creating an identity."
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and inculcated he may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather pellicose diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is now reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are therefore at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still working on their role, but they have already started the road to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is ready to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy has a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful and not alienate itself from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it that much importance since it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by refraining from voting on important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break as in the case of Libya.
Germany may have achieved a certain degree of respect for this.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US has clearly been in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of American domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend this position in public.
I believe that the real disparity of views does not really have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a higher entity, but must drive things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing with the euro now.
I believe that in future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a hairy subject.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take a leading role?
Or maybe you still find it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to have a more important role to play.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the United States on European policy is increasingly decreasing, but the EU does not cover this gap for the time being, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to play a more leading role.
Even if you don't like it, if you find it unpleasant, or if you make it an even more unpopular town, c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name is hidden a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it is protected as long as the true eponyms do not file a complaint.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing's law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to record their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is recorded Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the Puma sports goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a file in which he keeps seats from the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also served by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of forgeries.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On behalf of its customers, he fights against the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan,"
which refers to women who have "fish" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The mark makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and the one that grows at the highest rate.
However, making the registration of dubious legality in the registration of marks to be cancelled is complicated and also means a lot of money.
The processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had been so long since the name subject to the claim had already become a "market reality."
"If the plaintiff has bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the plagiator because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a blue and white logo that largely reminded BMW; the case was dealt with in court and Geely had to change it.
In China, the clothing manufacturer Lacosta lost to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trade mark office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have experienced difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the work emergency situation returned to normal."
In this way, the amount of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money.
As is often the case in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China will lead the list of new registrations around the world for the tenth consecutive year, as the brand office points out.
This also seems to be the case with the number of valid logos, a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been paid in terms of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each inscription costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For over seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese imitator in court.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
The imitator has managed to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark office also rejected the appeal of the municians.
In the following two instances, Freudenberg has been right, but the opposite party is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending.
Mr. Wentzler hoped that he would be able to resolve the issue favourably and commended the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the company file has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite party a "sum of six figures in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was not successful.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler says.
The dangers that lie in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe,
In particular, if the imitators are guaranteed the rights to unprotected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and skin products.
The group has long left this commercial area, but managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely prudent in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on brand rights, but what needs to be done is "to record in China also all that can be protected," as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite party license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the Imbongi chorus and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans are happy
The story of a link capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and mocasines look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contralt, low, tenor and soprano) begin to rise slowly, swirling, hindering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get almost out of his cells by trying to put order with his strong and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the Imbongi choir ensees a new song.
The fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years old, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the chorus has a different text and also in a little known foreign language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS programme, around the world there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa Association has found in Germany godparents for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school's tuition, the uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in zulu "storyteller" or "panegirist."
In this room no one knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years this chorus has been teaching songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
At 8,733 kilometres in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of contagion by half.
More than 40 per cent of the population of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with just over thirty years has become a common thing.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the chorus discovered this recondito population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but also the main: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than limited.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association that has since dealt professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STDs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The blades and the sarna are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected people?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are most often given in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomones, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, Chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms that indicate this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort in urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and are not detected.
How can one protect?
Condoms may reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer 100 per cent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if it is often changed as a sex partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees paid by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they raise a lot of money.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, the association's president.
In the Zodwa Dlamini people themselves a woman who is sure of herself and has leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It ensures that orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos," as older women are called in zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live in, and ensure that children go to school every day in a timely manner and are dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two hens and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to have many of the people tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, there is often no open talk of it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the innumerable seasons that travel the country from one side to the other and take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact. "
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many on the southernmost end of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to tear a couple of tears out of some other rabid border soldier.
The journey always takes you to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children who are sponsored.
Although this small population hardly appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines," says local people.
And after walking the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the test rooms on Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the way, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also ice-cold water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science."
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow a layer of ice has been formed.
It seems to be at least 30 centimeters and probably even 20 meters thick.
The water comes presumably from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that in its day collided against Mercury.
No one links the finding of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
In a completely unnoticed way for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet."
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the older stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newly born" stars.
This star-forming region, called unromantic by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopoa, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This tornado image of a dying star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifida Nebula, at 5,400 light years from the Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo from the galactic star formation area.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known with the nickname "The Seven Sisters," are a visible object to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Nebula of the Helix appears as a huge red eye appears in this image of infrared.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarium.
His similarity with a Earth continent has earned him the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This emerging star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It's probably about the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace of 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most sharp photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Remolino Galaxy.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Austrian European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this star formation area into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: at 400 million light years from the Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusion are flattened to each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Southern Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebula at 1,400 light years is made up of dust particles with a size of between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA's Hubble space telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of brightest young stars of our Milky Way.
This star formation area constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebula, new stars also continually emerge; at 5,000 light years from the Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a little black hole there's still no dust, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mainly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows the cosmos to be observed through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 metres.
The inconvenience of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed lifting angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is equal to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of alien life.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for External Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone with a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors your name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror shall cover 42 metres and shall consist of a total of 1,000 reflecting elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take images.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a mirror diameter of 30 meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has sent images of far-off worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for extra-solar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidates for planets had been located since the beginning of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers are based on the fact that there are also ice in the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.

The tour of the Talysh mountain region could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus moves with great stress through the winding road that passes next to forest hills, high-flow rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southern part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the "talyshi," a people of which not much is known, live, apart from the fact that the Persian and the Azeri are perfectly dominated and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city presupposes a perhaps too solid architecture designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit fully into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometres that separate both urban areas, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the World's oldest People's Festival," Fatulayeva says.
This is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis from the place that have been over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the older documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, there are also very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil record.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azeri tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that the calorie-rich food of the talyshi, which adore meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps the young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 he is relatively young for what is estimated by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it untiring moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents a long time ago.
There are also two young children coming from one side to the other.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses with an abombated shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long brazes of dark blond hair that his son finds us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, that's why I've never fallen and kept its color.
"I have never used a shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life, I've never been to buy from a supermarket.
Then you tell us about your husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything went back to its way when the "dear father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan, the worship of the nation's father, who directs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
The latter remained in power until 2003, when the witness gave in to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, a amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps the chaste son of Mirzayeva is right: "in our culture the elders are very respected."
They live in a great family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this was not enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the term "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rivals each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in pathetic.
"We must overcome the transition.
And if that happens, it is my responsibility, to the people and to God, "he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, especially to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the Seculars.
All of them, unremedied so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily overturn the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his powers "to save the revolution."
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree from the University of South California really wants to save.
Is it intended to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, the approval of which has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are of real concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
What does that mean, however, of "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the scope for legal manoeuvre that has been accompanied, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islamism.
It does not have to be this way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, which - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it aims to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to exercise a harsh repression of the opposition.
Following the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As set out in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values."
This is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
It is nothing more than censorship, speaking of course.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another forbids the offending or slander of the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it is to be punished.
Just as dubious is the formulation that prohibits "offending people"
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Mursi for signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back."
The opposition has been closing ranks in the face of the superiority of Islamists for weeks.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir del Cario Square and swore to make the Act fail before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up beating," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the presidential election lists.
The Nobel Peace and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the garbage bucket of history."
Through Twitter he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "coup d'état against democracy."
"When the referendum is convened, we will go to your palace and overthrow it," says opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned," the opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Quran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a countermeasure, in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, to the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry of: "the people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded that Mursi "clean the country," while proclaiming: "the Quran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those who oppose the draft constitution and the supporters of it would have expressed their high and clear views.
Now the time would have come to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this regard, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed by the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all the social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag."
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State had this lawyer resigned.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it," Saeda regrets.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestor in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most smelly fish?
The five million people of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country has any relation to its greed for a very smelly fish?
Take a series of cheeses over-cured.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing smell of the rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisite.
I'm in the small city of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is trout in bowl that is allowed to ferment in water for, depending on how smelly you prefer it, up to a year.
As it gets dark and colder, the Norwegian go to a festival that is held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
"You eat raw and then drink a glass of aquavit from a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a firefighter from the city who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk," who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink important amounts of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," Havard says.
The drink can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty struck Norway and in which, before refrigeration, fish was kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people in Sweden, the old rival and until it has made not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be an important, but rather a bad, part of the past of Norway.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But, in fact, it's all expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the €10 friolera ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news, and most Norwegian people like it.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 event."
It is very difficult for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth, there has been the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, while passing rakfisk trays and that, with her long, blonde meline and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, wise people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like to show."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money that they didn't have during the years that preceded the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and trekking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a crunch.
I'm in the snow queue to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, that smelly fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where the diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nostrils.
A TV has connected live with a presenter wearing a straw and which is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls off the chair, maybe beat by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start · Global Voices
As Mexico's incoming President, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant, analyses the challenges that the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing huge chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that objective."
Before he joined the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, that of Mexico.
A very populous and rapidly growing state that surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of on-site tourism and of the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and poached roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plates with your name at the entrance of a modern sports polideative and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he will be able to make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"In particular, as far as security and economy are concerned, we look forward to the interesting and true change that our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was unbanished by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations about Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that the opposition makes of the lack of the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere, very committed man with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic man of state and, above all, he is a person who knows how to listen. "
However, on the other side of the state that's not the impression that many people have on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hiding under high sections of the highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, military intervention was called for to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of women killed have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, that he was unable to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical people accuse their administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, his family believes that his partner killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed like she had been cleaned," says Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross in which one reads a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like I'm an old gossip, a troublemaker, a complaint.
What they want is for one to simply accept what they say and to shut up. "
"But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so many negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
"I hope he's the same kind of president as when he was governor," says PRI member Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is just what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, according to prosecutors
Prosecutors try to address Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse while in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period at the Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defence wants the case dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in United States history, lost multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims to have suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution's interrogation of Manning at a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence & apos; s request for the case to be dismissed, since his imprisonment had been hard and had already resulted in enough punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks posted the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At the Friday hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers completed after visits to Manning during his arrest at the military prison in Quantico, where he was held in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Los oficinas habrían realizado questions a Manning y annotado sus respuestas.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning recognized that he had described the treatment given to him by the cellars as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional."
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken about those problems and had indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after talking about problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council to examine the suicide intentions she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime under which he was found.
The military said that they had placed him under this restrictive regime, which is below the level of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine and (wanted) stop being under injury prevention... so that I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marines base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was going on in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was only reduced to Camp Arafat, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was gonna die in that cage."
Manning stated that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a flask, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the cellars couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 concerning the treatment of Manning.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in the Thursday statement, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the cellars and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said that he defied by the order given to him by the curator that he should drop the blanket he could have covered, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his chancas to self-harm himself but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed their underwear, their flyers and their glasses from their cell.
Their lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she spent during her prison stay and drastically reduce her sentence in case she was convicted at the war council, which is expected to start at the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that it plans to make Manning plead guilty of minor crimes and to defend other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has claimed that Manning was held in accordance with the applicable rules to all detainees in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegal publication of information on the Internet, leak of national defence information and theft of property or public records.
If he's found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, it had barely gone down the roof and reached the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some signs indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners."
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
Having grown up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's about ethnic tachygraphy, just like my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian."
I later decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, tachygraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have a native's vocabulary level and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the line of foreigners.
I thought about that time this week when Mexico's elected President, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always the leaders of these two countries meet, it was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment it is as likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as he will venture to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and to create a European Union-style trade block in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of grudge.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of its territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a United States official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Moctezuma stand up for war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the relationship that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about grudge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our genealogical tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed to the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a particular profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And, even though we may now be living the American dream, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and they look at us above the shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but, still, as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first ones know more solidly who they are and the second ones this bothers them.
Although a United States citizen, she is considered a part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel like they're not part of either.
We love to hear from the Mexican group The Northern Tigers, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I've heard during my trip, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as "ambassadors" of improvised Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be alone with this idea, folks.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful about how their relatives were treated far less long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the futile and usual discussions about who first began, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left everything in pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught in the regional turmoil.
Maybe this will make your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their lethal deadlock could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first sight, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been beaten up.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting the 1.7 million people of Gaza under pressure in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its relentless Fatah rivals, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their favour.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a reigning regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The exultant Hamas members say that the Islamist half-moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbulah militia party dominates, through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where the Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are prime brothers of Hamas and their leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in their place.
The Israeli Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States was stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for having started the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has widely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that erodes the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite the fact that, under international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why are you pampering those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good hit if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is higher than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a war with the area's superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and the demography makes the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions to Gaza every two to three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains that of sensible people from both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the transfer of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the other people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to stop the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he omitted to present his own plan for peace.
Again at the White House, he seems equally reluctant to devote his attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with disease look on boxes of a green turn off, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on generic tobacco and packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands by a wrapper of an olive green, some horrific images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies sick because they are children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small source type.
This is the most stringent regime in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the features that make this habit glamour.
He trusted studies that showed that if a person had not started smoking before the age of 26, there was a 99 per cent chance that he would never do so.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies stated that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre, from the British American Tobacco, in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that the forgers from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say that their business has benefited after the law has been passed.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for pylleres and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been fired almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was waiting for more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws that prohibit television advertising and sports sponsorship and that force most vendors not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you market tobacco and you only have this little window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews on brands from "ordinary citizens" posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It may be asked whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry is more focused on what new regulations mean than on marketing.
Industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries that are considering implementing similar legislation on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
"The photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them. "
"You take the cigar and save the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack stanco in downtown Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to put them on the shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unravel a delivery; now it takes four," Yu says.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, that's it, all right, it's over and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get bored a little.
During this year's Thanksgiving parties, I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spend half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free stores.
But there are more and more academics and child development experts who praise the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it's okay that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since, at present, most of us are connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept the boredom in a good way?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada, claims, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompeya there are graffiti in Latin on boredom dating from the 1st century AD
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a wide range of ways," says John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and putting the idea before a 100-person discussion group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a question of the environment or of the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be their own.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what's really happening to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September edition of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the next room a full-volume television show that had no relationship, others heard it with the low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear the audio at any time.
The group that heard the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it was hard to concentrate, but they were not sure why and they attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or doing scribbles, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a "boredom trend scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys have a more tendency to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a kind of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and his parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he was not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that "adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest levels," largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, as, taken to the end, it can cause us to be exposed to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into substance consumption as a method to combat it, as the research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain has to tell you you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar or cook, that'll satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your son is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer be bored, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to be dosed," says Professor Fenske.
And "that capacity to measure is applied to other situations," he says.
Your son not only learns to entertain himself, but also learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Our objective should be, rather, to be comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to be more bored, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate it to something that is worth it," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise ceases."
Colorado: No instruction book for new marijuana use law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and a football player in South-East Colorado, is facing a criminal process for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September, he and some friends were driving down Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by the police.
The police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences involving each a fine of US $100) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote for legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor drug-holding causes depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana-possession offences are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to file charges against those over 21 years of age for small-scale possession, which will be legally adopted once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's more conservative district prosecutors have committed themselves to moving forward with cases opened for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently authorized marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licences, all before the deadline, on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating the use of marijuana, first for terapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work.
"There is no real precedent that will serve as a model for us," he says.
The law of Washington, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's demand for "adequate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 metres of schools, parks, children's play areas or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a recent research group.
On 21 November, Oates, the head of the Aurora police, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would stop bringing criminal proceedings for minor offences of marijuana possession to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would stop bringing charges against these crimes "with immediate effect."
Police chief Oates said that they would be in charge of enforcing the city's regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal proceedings against those offences that were a crime at the time of their occurrence," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district prosecutor, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the outstanding possession cases.
"I don't think he's wasting his time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing the use of marijuana for recreational use into the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the people accused of marijuana possession and who is a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
"They have spent so much time bringing people to court who, in fact, still cannot accept it to be legal," he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the national test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The advocates of the legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some outstanding arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although drug agents are likely not to throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed under the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums about any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted for in the face of voting for what the state voted for. "
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was stalked until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
We don't attack college students because of their views just now.
I don't remember any time in my life that I haven't been dreaming of getting a square at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been where I was supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary age that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to run the history race, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper stated that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some college colleagues having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced to joke that I was gone because I was forced to drink in uncharted cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that it came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason, which in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbarous: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what that's about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-center students are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (a group of graduate students) of Corpus Christi College state that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as unpleased people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the equal opportunities committee of their university to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about the students' policy, which he presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, former member of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with the silver handle.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" by the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20, and Vice President of the Association of the Conservative Party of Nottingham University, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of left-wing in universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other. "
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old and history student at Corpus Christi who introduced the motion for greater protection, claims that this environment is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old and elected president of the OUCA, states that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards the people of the right center has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I went to college in September 1986, she was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
The hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a "honoris causa" title after the cuts in the funding of higher education.
The environment would have made any Stalinist stark.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that was waiting for me.
I discovered that the professors not only turned a blind eye to the maffe that was made of conservative college students, but that they participated in it willingly.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden rooms of the seminar.
The first I attended was to translate French texts from the 18th century into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't say one.
Pitt, a small man with a face that looked like a biscuit mass, knew well how to drive out bad bile.
"Is it that the thatcherists refuse to learn French, or is it that they are simply fools?" he asked.
The other college boys laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French in your free time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt grunts.
I went back to my room like a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at the time of dinner at college; then I felt a slight slap on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labour. "
Later on, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated. "
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who think like me just after nightfall?
Would I have to become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that were waiting for me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who was assigned to my college.
They hated him for being not only of the Conservative Party, but also of Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just over there.
He detested the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy here," he said.
I began to move from Oxford daily to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said with sadness.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude. "
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they've done it just to joke.
My heart would break if you left it. "
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had given up his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another Professor of History had insinuated, speaking entirely seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and I called them "old fools."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career in Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was in crouched with fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors ceased.
When they left, I packed the bag and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak, weeping.
But no 18-year-old person should be subjected to such intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party, but is now hiding behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura," which was opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer clients
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura," a retrospective apotheosic that brings together more than 130 high-sewing dresses created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This show is the colophone of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the raging and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the largest of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble modesty of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to idol of the international "jet-set."
Being in love with royalty has nothing to do with it.
"At least they don't turn off the butts of their pits on your magnificent carpet as some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and' 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his villa in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate to forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, she's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the modisto.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests was made to feel important and loved," recalls the "top model," which began working with him during the Paris High-Sewing Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art," he says.
Parade of alcurnia
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-matched love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-meter-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must walk through the walkway to contemplate a dream "audience" that looks like the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte," or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this public of mannequins, names such as the one of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg are relegated.
Naty Abascal and the Modist, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he made to me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, for he enhances our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria adds.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and they're "donors" to your face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergalso cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamt of getting to be the age and the opportunity to wear one of his night suits...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirt, "corsage" drapped and cliché word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her modesty party dresses with "the best care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories she carries."
The "king" of fashion
The great end of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding suit at his 1995 wedding to Paul of Greece.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the modist calls its seatshirts) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlaid, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the high seam of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society."
For years he has been obsessed with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"It has always brought to my attention its refinement, its calm, its pulchre and perfect appearance," says D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The toughest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living taking sulphur out of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas that emanates from the bowels of the Earth solidifies when you come into contact with the air.
After uprooting large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, it carries them in two baskets of bamboo that carry on their shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend by tortoise, keeping the balance and strenuous measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the cliff.
They know that any trip could cost them their lives, as was the case with a French tourist who was cleared years ago by the Kawah Ijen Rocks.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for every kilo of sulphur they extract
Once up, they open their way among the tourists who photographed them as if they were circus monkeys and, tirelessly loading the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometres to the balance that a mining company has located a little further down, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has exploited the volcano since 1960 and, never better, its workers, to whom it pays 662 rupees Indonesian (5 cents of euro) for every kilo of sulphur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in daily life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As it is normal to load 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," Anto explains, who usually carries out three daily ports.
It takes three hours for each and it ends up ground, but they allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such inhuman effort, it is three times what I would gain in the field.
"The day of the miners is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," says the carrier, who used to work as a masonry on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing and irritating his eyes by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing his skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already started to pass the bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing with difficulty, he's constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Called by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other porters, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the dark.
Defying the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater lighting up with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers carry the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its penguins, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and both the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of recharge per chamber that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists to come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the beasts and not for the people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in the Kawah Ijin three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and hears the eyes when the wind changes unexpectedly and catches the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that none complain of serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and wounds in the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at 53.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres away by a way of goats between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works with sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest trades in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we do our civic duty and we believe life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an ad for mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, has the hope that with the announcement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do "their national duty."
This is a purely Internet thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was an issue that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast-dating evenings (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state city in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore & apos; s birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says that it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the single age, and to the delay of marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia is barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst electoral result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has a known impact on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box," which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have areas of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hindered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards an increase in the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre seems not to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important to me to have my own money and time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it's Singaporeans who have the last word.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the sphere of private life that is entitled to protect from any interference."
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How do you apply this definition to your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by ventilating on the Internet situations that you would probably not share out of line?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very mine," on the personal level, and "in the key and name of the user," when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not go up to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of private at sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I have fun with my acquaintances, too.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone who's making a fool of me," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to meet his 35 friends on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer, I just go up," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone who would recommend to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14, is different.
The teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to meet 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, none of them have been hinted at or asked for the address of his house or his phone number.
"If I was pressed or demanded, I just took them out of my account," he recognizes.
José followed Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"He just gave her privacy."
Then he explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I like it or I want to.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher in English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed," he says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, a master in Pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work Native and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He says that the topic is complex, "because we are asking you to have a defined criterion on what is or is not to be disseminated, published or said at an age that maturity does not give for that."
"Also that they are selective when what they care about most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like the one you posted about a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask the other people for permission to label them?
And one more, do you all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do online.
It's the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, as it should be on social media," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to read social media policies.
By understanding each of the paragraphs they have solid foundations for talking with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind the children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
Unasur Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven leaders attending.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency indicated at the beginning that they would deliver it after the closure, but then stated that it would be published at some point on the Peruvian Government's website.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a few brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day only the unsound video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio."
The little information that circulated among the reporters was given by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents who attended, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is the pronunciation of Humala, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South America-Arab Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being strongly required by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international citations, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that there were secure transmission systems for all journalists but limited to the maximum the collection of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Hague Court that would lead to a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both sides, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will abide by and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with her Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the judgements of that international court, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the inassistance of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residence agreements."
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-price Internet access in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and to see a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to prefer a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian President said in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the cross-cutting axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give more details.
The outcome document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations," of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace and good relations between neighbours was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, Colombia's President, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional event that he hoped to meet with his partner from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal respectfully with the maritime dispute following a decision of the CIJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell you that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega were to meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers met previously to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, today stated that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He advocated, in this regard, the project to establish South American citizenship that is encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
"The free mobility of citizens and workers must be achieved by any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian President also supported the reposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give a chair never commit to anything, and instead we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa said that he is not repented of that decision because it has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "profound democratic and human rights values."
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that its process was not respected."
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for demanding that it be interrogated on its territory for an alleged sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out by video conference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a little lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
What does exist is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa noted that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe way to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been discussions with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of procedures in different European bodies," he said.
And he said that "if Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this is over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows, and as it has in other cases, interferes with Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interferes with him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lie, which distort freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists for profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard, he welcomed the fact that it is no longer these journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador," and said that if re-elected, "it will deepen the revolution to continue the right path and direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and golpism covered with legality" because it "actually destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian President also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua now the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that failure is not respected.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They have to be processed in a comprehensive way to overcome them and move forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries held in the same court in Peru and Chile and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international bodies if the two countries undertake to accept a decision no matter how hard."
Referring to the eventuality that he is running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections he will withdraw from public life.
I have never had any personal interest in power, but in situations as unfair as that of Ecuador, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, for we have to accept that reponderance," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term in the presidency, and from there we came out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he went to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that he was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The head of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths are a cause of late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the test result: AIDS positive.
"It was like I dropped a bomb," he refers to reminiscent of the time of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to make "softer," with no obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to report on it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is certainly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
So, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, even many people arrive when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV / AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of exposure to the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectations for non-drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that those who receive HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25, under these terms "while in control, they can live smoothly until the age of 75," the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths go to May this year; however, it is ensured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not about access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a drug shortage the problem is that patients are very advanced because they are not aware of their infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a strong fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and therefore have to be offered to all people who need it in a massive way."
In his proposal, there are also specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a particular laboratory to test, only motivated by a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
It all changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I'd better burst three times a week," they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the drugs.
To date, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I have a correspondent, I care for myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, who are afraid.
If they were at risk, the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the AIDS battle motto this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Large are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatian journalist who has taken the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has indeed increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are still those who have no access to a condom today," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sorna and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to expose themselves, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that the condoms should not be only behind the counters and that those hundred should be found in public bathroom dispatchers at the sites frequented by young people.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not sexuality, the best thing is to bring the condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4 ° national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13 ° HIV.
92% of the contagies correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by an appeal court in the United States a sentence that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario places a bad precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures in support of the survival of the signatures allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, as opposed to international agreements.
In the practical field, the backlash to the sentence issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican firms defenceless in the face of the possibility of the embargo of their properties in beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
To that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law had been established, with the American Law Institute being placed as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-company vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their matrix, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Concourses.
The fact is, moreover, that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, however, Vitro's creditors who fought against it in the U.S. Cortes, that is, the "vulture" funds such as Capital Aurelios, Convergence Aurelios, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, this blames Vitro for the difficult situation that he faced since 2008, in spite of the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, beating the colletazos to the country.
For the time being, the signature of the González Sada family will bring an appeal to the appeal court itself for the vote to reach the plenary, that is, the five judges, since only three of them voted.
If this is not successful, the appeal of Cercorare, which requires a review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice, will be claimed.
The serious thing about the case is that the court circumvented a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Contest Act, noting that it was disavowed with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is, the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensure equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General balance
For several months, the complaints placed on the table by the Mexican Aviation unions against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Aviation Pilots has already found the neck of the bottle.
The instance led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, who is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the employer to remove from the trust F / 589 of the IXE Bank, in the name of Mexican Aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Administrator of Hotels.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're going to the Dragon Mart.
Meeting on the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal center of sale and distribution for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of the country of the wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
The Canacintra had previously managed to unify the governors of the south-east area to oppose the monumental costo that it destroyed with part of protected areas and poses the mother of all the amagos against the industry.
The ACTA died.
The government has suspected a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has already passed to the file.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an infringement of freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Trotamundos of the Hector basketball "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the board and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was involved in sport for more than 60 years, he was as a player of minor categories, a player of the National Superior Basketball, taken over and a leader in the BSN with the Bayamon Vaqueros or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put many hats on basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was President of the BSN, General Manager of the National Team and Federal President during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate in making that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide trajectory, attest to it.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, those who treasure with the greatest emotion are those who remember their passage through the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years of age, acting as a co-seizure or a franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, either as a proxy, a co-leader or a leader.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Minty's debut year at the BSN.
From then on, he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have you a very strong, 6" 7 "tall player.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Minty, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Minty had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Vaqueros with Gausse championship enjoyed it, but already to the distance, since by 1988 it was already a federal mandama.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his performances and those of Minty in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the pre-Olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived fourth and must have been bronze if it wasn't for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that the 1990 World Cup group the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a hairs to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the world.
This team not only repeated Minty, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the Lion brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 PreOlympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the players suspended by the mess of the Pan American of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all forecasts.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level like Piculín did.
And that without counting his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Borician leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What did you have left to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in national playoffs.
Right now, children travel and play too unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsive certifications and course for leaders, table officers and arbitrators.
I'm pleased with that.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and go to basketball games every now and then.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas," in which he incarnated an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the Dallas television series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a production house of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast by the NBC network from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that were on the air for a short time, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well received by the critic in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his most starry.
The CBS series on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was on the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?," thought to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked in gambling houses.
It also helped give the series a record of audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and made "Dallas" the second most seen entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R. 's sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened her with a prostitute's tacharla unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheater businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be interned.
"I know what I want on J.R's tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were lucky to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
The recording of five of the chapters for the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in the process, the chain reported.
There was immediately no pronunciation by Warner or TNT about how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
Oriundo de Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tested his luck at the New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't put anything there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in some way," he told Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "don't be afraid, it'll be a little awkward for a short while, but they're gonna be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
They start course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the religious professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Maya Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clung as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he expected in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "debitarageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-of-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last in history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they are compared to real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have set up a team to teach a course, entitled "The End of the World."
"We do not add '2012' to always have the option to give the course again, in case the world is not over," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin," students must study, generate projects and take final tests.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
The students, for their part, claim that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology career student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
The apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of the Psychology and Nursing career, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said he believed in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and we discredited it in a way," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student at Temple, 21 years old and West Chester.
"The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
"People don't think about this elsewhere," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, insinuating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final trial have been discussed, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
"I may call some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
