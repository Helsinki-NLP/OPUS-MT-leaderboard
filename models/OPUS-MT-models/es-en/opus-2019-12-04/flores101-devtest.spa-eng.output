In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plummeries, an already widespread theory, it also provides specific data that fossils usually do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to specialists, this animal has a brown plumage at the top and a pale or carotenoid tonality at the bottom.
The finding also allows a better understanding of the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Since the plumage of the dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called raquis, but it does have other features of the feathers (sows and barbulas), the researchers concluded that the raquis is likely to be the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to the flight, but used them to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of it. Researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' assessments were that, even when it comes to the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

In France, the elections have traditionally been an untechnological experience: voters are isolated in a cubicle and put into an envelope of a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the staff members confirm the identity of those who stand for vote, the latter enters the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French electoral law provides for procedures in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that there are no additional ballot boxes other than those of those who vote, duly computed and authorized.
Candidates have the power to send representatives to control each stage of the process and, at night, volunteers compute the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

The researchers indicated that the two compounds react to each other to lead to crystals that can obstruct renal function.
The specialists detected the formation of crystals in the urine of the fellines, by the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
When compared through the use of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the composition of the crystals could be determined to match that found in the urine of the affected pets.
I do not know whether they have noticed this or not, but most of the products from Central America came to this country tax-free.
Even so, the countries of Central America taxed 80% of the products that we produce. We treat you with tariffs.
It seemed to me that that didn't make sense; it definitely wasn't fair.
All I tell people is that you treat us just like we treat you.
A bill was passed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who does not allow violent video games to be sold or rented to minors.
The bill provides that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labelled with a decency with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of the Office of the Attorney General, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning reporting that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. Norman Lamb MP is expected to assume the post of business minister that Davey leaves vacant.
16 February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to report to the Westminster Court of Magistrates.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, 25 and 21, respectively, died.
Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and jaw, while for Kristoffer Schneider a facial reconstruction surgery was necessary.
Uka's weapon was stuck while pointing at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, does not see with one of his eyes, he lacks a part of the skull and his face must have been rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified through a virtual link from a United States Air Force base in his country of origin.
Carpanedo took part in two individual championship races apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "He did not finish the first race," as did 36 of the 116 participants of that race.
In his other career, the giant slalon, he got the tenth place in the female group of sittings with a combined execution time of 4: 41.30, 2: 11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1: 09.02 minutes below the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skiers in the sitting category failed to complete their careers and a total of 45 participants of 117 of the Giant Slalom did not achieve the qualification in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, said, "We have put five individuals under arrest who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the defendants.
According to the police superintendent, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused came to court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house at the time of the car's impact, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services took the driver of the red Audi TT from the inside.
At first, he was transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh County Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody pending prosecution and trial, any statement by an eyewitness may be questionable, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other regions of the United Kingdom, but as Scottish justice works otherwise, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at Dundee University said: "Journalists seem to walk on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecutions, told journalists that no additional comments would be made at least until the indictment was issued.
According to the information that was leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve on the basis of the limits in force prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, as reported, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the supplementary pest control test, the rangers were to closely monitor the shooters, since the shooters were monitored and their effectiveness was assessed.
In a union between NPWS and the Australia Sports Shooters Association (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited as part of the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage Office, noted that comprehensive security and training was provided to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
In four years, it's Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised that the previous CEP should resign, as part of a series of measures that seek to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were caused by the fact that no elections are held, in some cases since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods have been reported with problems of operation and exessive warming, resulting in six fires and burns of less than four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having recorded 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company listed as "non-serious."
The ministry spoke about the delay in Apple's report, saying it was something "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by a earthquake at 7: 19 local time (21: 19 GMT) on Friday.
The North Mariana emergency management agency indicated that there was no record of damage on the national territory.
The Pacific Tsunamis Alert Centre also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country abducted a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong captive.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed to have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was crushed.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
He received training in obstetrics and entered work for the Auckland National Women's Hospital by 1959.
Liggins began his research on early delivery in his free time, while working at the hospital.
His study showed that the baby's fetal pulmonary maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators managed to recover the flight logs from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the Far. He died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Gold in Powder Runnels stated: "Moon was as rare as me; even, even more. I love and miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, among the 1400 respondents prior to the 2010 federal elections, there has been an 8 per cent growth of those who are opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, the Acting Prime Minister, said that he believed that Australia should become a republic after the end of the term of office of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this vision and want Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At one end of the survey, there are 29% of people who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other, 31% who believe that it should never do so.
The Olympic gold medal winner had to swim in the free style of 100 meters and 200 meters, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned as a result of his complaints.
It has not been possible to take pain relief medicines, because it is prohibited to use them in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number of cousins ever known.
Many people checked the finding by using various types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was released on Tuesday.
Possibly, comets have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as of organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of scientists is to understand how planets, particularly ours, originate, since comets crashed on Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, assumed as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill that allows people of equal sex to marry.
He called the rumours "political talk and bobbing."
It is speculated that it will be presented to the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce airway distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and to provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be implemented and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and deterrence will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, the possibility of the game being held behind closed doors, without the equipment's fans, was considered.
On Thursday, Science published an investigation that reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, in the United States, and Uppsala, in Sweden, reported that the new species managed to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproduction between an endemic Darwin pinzon, Geospiza fortes, and a migrant cactus pinzon, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take all kinds of forms and enroll in tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it to a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It is such the thin that it can be achieved that it was used to decorate the hand-made illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (pH H) present in the chemical analysed determines their pH level.
The hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron. Therefore, an ion of hydrogen is the result of dissipating a proton from its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with hygienic and wet hands, express them to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in your hands and its outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with discharge in almost all houses, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, vestiges of sewer systems were found.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public bathrooms had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, as the light of the atmosphere of the Terra distorts part of the light and sight we have.
A giant rocket, more than 100 feet high, is required to carry a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing that it has done for us was to provide us with a much simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to it today we have many means of transport, such as rail or car, among many others.
Below, there are more moderate-sized fenines that feed on medium dams, from rabbits to antilopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much more quantity, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to its success is the concept of niche: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most socialized fellyfish and their life goes on within large groups called flocks.
The flocks are made up of one to three adult males of the same family group, together with up to thirty females and their offspring.
The females are usually closely related to each other, which makes them a large family of sisters and daughters.
The flocks of lions have the same behavior as those of wolves or dogs, with whom they keep an amazing similarity (unlike the other great fellines) both in their conduct and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
An integral athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, give extensive jumps and pull five times stronger than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four fellines capable of emitting roars.
The tiger's is not a full sound roar like the lion's, but rather a prayer of words spoken to grunts and screams.
The ocelotes enjoy feeding on small creatures. As far as possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of their prey will have a much smaller size than their own.
Scientists believe that the ocelotes track and find animals to eat (prey) through the smell, smelling the soil where they have passed.
They have very good nocturnal vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very silently. Obelotes hunt their prey by miming with their surroundings and then bounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) deviates from the main one they come from (for example, if they move to a mountain chain or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they used to be.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the nascent population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble less and less the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to catalogue them as of the same species.
This process is called the spice, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inescapable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (they fire).
The food of the plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from the plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without them, the animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of his time, so he feared nothing, except for others of his own species.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth as knives, in addition to another additional group in the palate, which means that anything that happened to him before him had no escape.
We don't have the safety, but he could have had the viperine. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurids and, even, he could have been a cannibal.
It also attacks any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as the T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at the banquets, such as boars, peacocks, snails and even a type of rodent, the liron.
Another thing in which they differentiated was that humble people and women ate sitting in a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and taking sides while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included food that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigrace, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no old Roman ever had a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a central temple considered their home.
People carried sacrifices for the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of those holding ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Special towers were sometimes built in a pyramidal form, called zigurats, to form part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the midst of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of no greater importance.
The Hebrew families spent most of their time in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just shows that gave to the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, the wood was extremely expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a trip he took further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to their discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the place by then.
While each country separately was "Scandinavian," there were marked differences in relation to the people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasury, you may believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the back of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written in its reverse the phrase "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776." The text is on the bottom of the document, face down.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that it was barely made, the huge scroll document (it is 29 inches by 24 ½ inches) was rolled to be kept.
Therefore, the annotation is likely to have been added only as a sign.
While the landings carried out during D-Day, as well as the subsequent clashes, had resulted in the liberation of northern France, the southern side still remained.
His government was in the hands of the French of "Vichy," which were a group that, in 1940, had agreed peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the so-called "Dragon Operation" was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, the American and the Free French forces had achieved the liberation of southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which a large group of people live and work together - that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related both to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, and to civitas, that whose meaning is city or city state and that, in addition, determines in some way the size of society.
The state cities are the pioneers of the nations. A culture of civilization involves a long generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and cannot be recognized as civilizations themselves.
During the War of Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a central government that was indeble under the articles of the Confederation, in which the congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to set taxes and, given that there was a national executive or judicial power, such a role was vested in the state authorities, which often did not cooperate to enforce all their laws.
Nor was it entitled to override tax laws or inter-state tariffs.
The articles called for the unanimous approval of all states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football group, together with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, jockey on ice, jockey on skates and Formula 1 races.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
In Japan there are about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago on the globe.
Because of the conglomerate / group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago," from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when the sailors of Europe who sailed the place recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, that is, a beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch Eastern Indian Company, of a base in the south-west of Taiwanese, began a transformation in the Aboriginal method of grain production, with the use of Chinese labour to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty army (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter a province dependent on the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government adheres to the Shimonoseki treaty, through which it cedes Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which retains its control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three capital buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and that of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been rebuilt at the extremes of the complex so that tourists can visualize how they looked originally.
By 1976, 30 per cent of the Machu Picchu had already been restored and work is ongoing today.
To exemplify, the most common global fixed image photography format is 35 mm, which was the most used film size towards the end of the age of analog films.
Today it continues to occur, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship was moved to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the dimensional relationship of this format (divided by twelve in order to calculate the ratio of the simplest integers) is equivalent to 3: 2.
Many typical formats (verbifracy, the group of APS formats) are equal or very similar to this relationship of appearance.
The third rule, which has been the subject of constant mockery and often ridiculed, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while allowing some order to be given to images.
It indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection that forms between the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into third (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the plebe.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are reserved for that specific function.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the hostilities began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated generally recognized international law and was covered by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain drew international waters into entire sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany was planning to find a similar reaction to its unrestrained underwater war.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation note made by Charles Batchelor (his last job manager) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The former China had a unique way of delimiting different periods of time. Each stage or family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with divided provinces. The best known was the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Hhan and Jin dynasty.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out among many nobles who were fighting the throne.
One of the most bloody periods in the history of Antigua China was that of the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed for the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same is true of the military, as instead of basing the army's positions on classes, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people in the repressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which lasted in time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, lies a cave completely removed from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one was sure of its existence. Inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, raised by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal-shaped and large-sized structures built to venerate the deceased Pharaoh.
The Plateau of Guiza, or "Necropolis of Guiza," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and smaller temples were raised in honor of their wives and relatives.
The "arch-up" mark resembles a V and the "arch-down" mark is similar to a staple or a square without its lower edge.
Above it means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and below it means you should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The ascending movement of the bow generates a softer sound, while a descending one is stronger and thinner.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the arc instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Mary Antonieta, her two little children (Mary Teresa, 11 years old and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threw threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to completely open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid U.S. imperialism's war expenses in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to cover most of the expenses and interest of the bonds that fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government at the Wall Street banks.
From now on, the super gains from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main gains of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events are located is usually known as the Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 d. C.).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends about 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that understands, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the destiny of humanity and that is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technological development itself is deployed on a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of cars necessarily results in road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small volume of cars, and new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The massive use of cars also leads to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, leading to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography were developed, which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered such in feudal Europe.
His fame of being an epicenter of luxury began at approximately 400 BC and spread to approximately 1100 AD.
During the 12th century their status declined, especially because, on their return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, to which they were given greater value than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title "fashion capital" was then transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style took place in the period between the X-XI and the XIV centuries.
In the beginning, the way of clothing received great influence from Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of communication channels, Western styles could lead to a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, product of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to buckle their clothes.
subsistence agriculture is meant to produce sufficient food to exclusively meet the needs of the farmer and his family group.
Livestock agriculture is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds from the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence agriculture, which continues to be practised in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and provide them with the possibility to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The features that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a mix of factors.
It is common for the members of a subculture to display features of their belonging to it by using the distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashion, gestures and jerking.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to chart the importance of socializing is to analyse the few and lamentable cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "savages." Some wild children are confined by people, in general their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the parents & apos; rejection of the child & apos; s serious intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered from traumatic situations or serious child abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals and some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, he or she has behaviors (within his or her physical possibilities) almost in a whole equal to those of the specific animal who took care of him or her, as well as his or her fear or indifference to people.
Even though project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, an assistance that provides support to those who go through a new experience, such as the use of a new software or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the small animated clipboard of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is incorporated into the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no affection, care and education; but it happens.
We can see that the family care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The aim of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, love tutors, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of family care is to cover all needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously collected.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are identified as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "long-term relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, there have been important findings in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face of just a few milliseconds of duration.
In particular, it is argued that, through the proper reading of its microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, however, accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that the skills to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
The research work of the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection process removes it from that set of variations.
The segregation and recombination cut the variation between one generation and another generation after generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is equal to human, to meet their amino acid needs with the plant resources at its disposal.
In fact, not doing so brings serious problems: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the most easily accessible source of plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
In short, we should not be surprised if our own predecessors were to solve their "protein problems" in the same way as the savannah chimpanzees today.
The sleep break is to wake up intentionally during the normal sleep period and fall asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved with a more or less soft alarm watch that makes it return to a conscious state, though without waking it up completely.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and address of your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm are to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known as diuretic) before bedtime, which will force you to rise to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is related in an opposite way to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of life we count on. Each of us has the potential to find peace and absolute bliss.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders the way is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread along the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In general terms, laism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the way of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (lighting) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Yoga Devata. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be unhindered, chakras activated and the awareness of lighting developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the US was the result of a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended by distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and would really be fought, through substitute militias, on battlefield from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other sites.
Because by September 17, 1939 the Polish defence was already broken, its only hope was to give the withdrawal and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost every day, when more than 800 000 Soviet Red Army fighters entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the regions of eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more effective way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the power to transfer its population and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II provides one of the most clear and recent examples of this. Americans were trying to move men and materials through the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German army, using mainly submersible, tried to nullify this circulation.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, the goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, on the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
In order to easily get their milk, hair, meat and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes began to stay with them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in flocks wandering the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goat herders who used to be children or adolescents, similar to the most popular shepherd. These grazing methods are still being used today.
In England, the train tracks had already been installed by the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the chariots were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve a higher speed and to carry heavier loads than on the roads a little more craggy of the day.
The incorporation of sleepless to keep the rails in place occurred quite early. However, gradually, they were realizing that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron at the top.
This became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with other wheels made of iron and, in 1767, solid iron rails began to be used.
The first way of transport that was known was to walk. The human being began to do so in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means an upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking erects.
While traces of bipedestation have been found in Australopitec fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start to lead a life more friendly to the planet, be part of environmental movements, or even become activists and fight to lessen, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment, but if not only a temporary situation is sought, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of people's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent and signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, to the John Dunlap printing house, a few streets away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are currently known as the "Dunlap Copies."
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did it in the courtyard of the Hall of Independence on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that he be read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A lot of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. It's the birds.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have squammed and claw extremities, lay eggs and move on their back legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate on the basis of the handling of data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be demonstrated immediately. Their symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be to find an open bottle of medicines or toxic chemical cleaning products.
Read the label to have specific information about the first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasite insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with the bedbugs, a species very developed to parasite humans.
The murderous and bed bedbugs are nidiculous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The recorded cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. are about 400 000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, binding the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve, is the object of attack of multiple sclerosis.
Studies indicated that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple could conclude that raising a baby would not be the best thing for them or for the child.
These couples may choose to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The central objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed on the classical works, especially the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially the questions of science, even psychology, were accepted.
As the domain of the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots, both philosophical and scientific.
Many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behavior often depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological watches.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only about reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are self-sustaining and have a free cyclical period of operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using phagos, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fagus with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulphur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while those that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including animal and vegetable wildlife.
Examples of possible activities at the site are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, and ecosystem information study.
One example is to visit, take pictures and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross with others whose jobs are in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transfer shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supported a transport system based on the use of private cars.
At present, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the past two million years.
They are all part of society and make use of transport systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of claims about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason why transport systems give rise to complaints of such a caliber and why are there faults every day? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is there anything more substantial that is happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not a simple task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to maintain relatively consistent behaviour, allowing traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be the subject of approximate mathematical representation.
In order to more clearly graph the flow flow, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both the planning and design and the operations of road devices.
The first species to lift were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and partner more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend the wings back, hitting them to the sides of the body.
This provides a larger range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Today, anisopteros and ephemeropteros are the only insects unable to bend their wings.
Milenians back, a man named Aristarco commented that the Solar System was revolving around the Sun.
There were those who shared their theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system was orbiting the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, as you don't see your movement on Earth, do you?
The Amazon River is the most cuddly and the second largest river on the planet. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, at some points with a range of up to six miles.
Of the total water coming from the rivers of the world that flows into the oceans, 20 percent is derived from the Amazon.
The large Amazon River has an extension of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, it was never able to overcome those of Guiza, neither in size nor in the sublime of the technique of its building.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Empire were marveled by the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time dated from more than a millennium.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the largest country in the world.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by most of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All of the citizens living in Vatican City are attached to the Roman Catholic religion.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known from ancient times, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but at the same time it had the theory that they are transformed into new substances that make up the things we see.
The alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. From now on, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
There may also be alloys with small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are non-metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively tiny that the end point of this prayer could contain billions of them.
So, when it was invented, the pencil won a lot of friends.
Unfortunately, following the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't need to even approach a sachet.
It just remains to be asked what will become of the keyboard when something new comes up.
The atomic pump operates on the basis of the principle that energy is required to form a core with a large amount of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens by rolling a heavy car up a hill. By dividing the core once again, it releases part of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to break down with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearby side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the high lands.
There may be more seas on the nearby side because its bark is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to ascend to the surface.
Content theories focus on looking for what attracts or likes people.
These doctrines maintain that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors of their environment force them to do or not to do certain things.
Two well-known theories are that of the hierarchy of needs, of Maslow, and of the two factors, of Hertzberg.
In general, two types of behavior can occur when managers start leading their former partners. On one side of the spectrum, there is an attempt to continue to be "one of the boys" (or girls).
Managers in this category have a hard time making decisions that fall badly on employees, imposing disciplinary measures, performing performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and accountability to staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into an unrecognizable person who believes it is necessary to modify everything that the group has been doing so far and to do in its own way.
In the end, the ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This way of acting often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence used by conventional equipment apply to virtual equipment, although there are small differences.
The members of a virtual team often operate as a point of contact for their nearest physical group.
They generally enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, thanks to the fact that it is possible for their teams to meet in accordance with different time zones which, for example, may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible equipment" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual equipment.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of the management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What reason could an organization have to submit to the demanding process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all available resources are properly used in the operational departments of an organization, space is generated for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organization that works as a team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and conduct contributes to the research of scientists.
Several types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors have long been known to affect behavior and cause changes in mental function.
Thanks to the apogee of new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that are produced in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which support our understanding of mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is very much associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of great relevance within the computer, which is responsible for the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the AI field involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to clients' diagnoses and consultations, as well as facial, writing, voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and militia, just as it was incorporated into various applications of video game software and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places where it is not possible to reach by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also an excellent way to reflect on an exit and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State capital and each year the page is updated, but previous versions are kept online that in the form of a souvenir album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Even though students often start their blog experience with a little-cared grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blog writer begins to strive to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "requires students to be more understanding of the world than around them." The need to fuel the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to Internet content, they can define their positions in the context of other people's writings, as well as establish their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and has a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the country's history and today.
The Niagara Falls are more to the south and the north is home to the unexploited natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are those that highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are little populated and some are wild, almost uninhabited lands.
To make a population comparison that causes great surprise to many: in the United States they live more African-American than Canadians.
The location of the East African islands is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and one continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also taken to the land by the Arabs and was largely imposed on the Comores and Mayotte.
The initial point of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route between Cape Europe and India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to say they are married, no matter what their actual marital status is.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must realize that cultural differences can cause what they consider to be harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be strong in rejecting men and do not fear defending their position (there are cultural differences or not, that is not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and merenidas used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan Sultan under the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their business there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are plenty of places where traditional Moroccan articles are sold, such as mud pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of bagatelas, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist point in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its submerged streets, especially in the center of the city.
While Goma is quite safe, any visit abroad must be considered in order to be aware of the situation of the ongoing clashes in North Kivu province.
In turn, the city is the basis for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla sightseeing excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To move inside Goma, you can choose to take a wedding-wedding (mototaxi). The regular rate (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, in addition to being relatively inaccessible, has given "Tombuktu" an image of exotic and distant land.
While Tombuktu is an impoverished city today, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was incorporated into the list of sites of the heritage of humanity at risk, the result of the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops of the special Wonders in the African world, by Henry Louis Gates, in PBS.
The city contrasts a lot with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoareas, each of which develops a different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is recognized as the main icon of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all of South Africa's natural reserves, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It may also be convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows access to park selections in South Africa or to all the national parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the homonymous island, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The deployment of buildings that delimit the Hong Kong horizon has been compared with a graph of bright bars that is demonstrated by the presence of the waters of Puerto Victoria.
The way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon bank, located in front.
It is on the land recovered from the northern coast of Hong Kong that its urban development is concentrated, densely.
This is the place the British conquerors took as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, it is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest chain of coastal mangroves, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a heritage of humanity. The section of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Without prejudice to this, the forests are not just mangroves, but they have some of the last trees left of the imposing jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about one third of its area is covered by water or swamp areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 real tigers in Bengal and about 30,000 motorized deer in the area.
The buses leave the station between districts (across the river) all day long, although most, especially those travelling to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6: 30 and 7: 30.
Because buses between districts are often filled with passengers, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster bus service, which are comfortable and resistant.
Sharing a taxi trip is an agile and comfortable way to move to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge of the Oyapock River is a rough structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapock, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not enabled for transit until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that currently constitutes eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in the region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to the practice of subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region hosted other Aboriginal groups, for example, the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who were hunting, collecting and fishing as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of Indias," was born in the 16th century, as a product of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the stage of colonization, which extended for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its idiosyncrasy and Aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best polo players worldwide.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower games can also be seen in other parts of the year.
On the site of the Argentine Polo Association you will get information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the Malvinas pound (FKP), the official currency of the Malvinas Islands, is set in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands, there you can change your money. It's in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds are usually accepted anywhere inside the islands. In Stanley, it can also be paid with credit cards or US dollars.
There are likely to be no credit cards on the periphery islands, but it could use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to be able to define the accepted payment method.
It is virtually impossible to change money from the Malvinas Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do so before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located in southern Ecuador, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above + 30 ° C during the summer.
The winter cold can be misleading: although it is very rare that temperatures are below the freezing point, the wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer points out.
There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so it must not be fed or hindered.
According to the information of the park authorities, at least 100 yards / meters from the bears and wolves and 25 yards / meters from the rest of the wild animals must be maintained.
Without prejudice to how meek they can look, the fact is that the bison, the uapatis, the moose, the bears and practically all the large animals can be aggressive.
Tens of visitors suffer injuries every year for not keeping an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that release a lot of aroma and keep cleaning in the camp.
The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40 000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the stage of a nefarious naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except a British cruise. They died about two hundred American and German individuals.
During the war for independence that the Mau movement faced, a peaceful meeting in the city had as a result the murder of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two ports. The best known are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district of the Pacific Ocean, the beaches of North Shore are located from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all of sand with safe places to swim and most of them have pohutukawa trees that offer places of shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive, in the extravagant neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland, are deployed in the port of Waitematas.
These are family beaches, sometimes very busy, with numerous and varied shops available on the thing. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is the Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better to transport.
The local tap water is completely safe for your consumption, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottle water.
Australians consider the notion of "flat white" coffee to be foreign. A black boy coffee is called "espresso," cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
