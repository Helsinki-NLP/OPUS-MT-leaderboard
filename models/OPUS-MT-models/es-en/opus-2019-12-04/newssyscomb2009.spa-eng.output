Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together form 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a significant weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the party of the populist right.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously staggering.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the State of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent of votes, thus losing 5.5 per cent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse has still finished the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the SVO left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, to date, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this could be achieved by Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the strengthening of both parties of the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 per cent and the BZO, 11 per cent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would happen in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it was disintegrated from BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction by the European Union.
For this evolution Haider clearly bet who already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he is already taking his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach Parliament although it has lost slightly and has fallen from the third to the fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four per cent limit and therefore was not part of Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can cool down
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally collecting beetles is not solved in India, then the Czech-Indian relations could be cooled, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then this cooling would certainly be achieved," he noted after the meeting that was organized on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get involved.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was free of charge and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local Darjilling government in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
He can then apply for the discharge of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself on the same terms during the meeting.
"It consents to appeal to the High Court and then it would be possible to pardon," said the Chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the case is by getting the convicted person "legal competent support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already achieved by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it, "Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as ČTK said, before his colleague he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a terrible mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister avoided the answer to the question whether he received a promise from the Indian side that he would take up the matter.
"I have received enough promises," he only found.
A Czech arbitra a struggle at the bottom of the sea
I approach an electronic wall map, in which Australia is represented surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent, "says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its head, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed has so far hidden a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to date that themselves carry the key to the development of cancer medicines.
The bottom is greater than the earth's firm
The coastal countries have now begun to fight the new territories under the sea in a peaceful manner.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is essentially the so-called continental border which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
"Simply, the continental border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the edge of the sea coast, and often, to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone, "Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continent, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal expert aid commission.
The Commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward, "adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine domain.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the bottom surface that the commission granted it last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pain for their study.
The profit that will be deducted from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so until they are ten years old from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay."
Where the continental border ends, the region of the ocean bottom, declared by the Treaty as the "common heritage of humanity," begins.
Now here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is no gold mine," Director Mikulka says with emphasis, adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract."
Czech in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Block within the common organisation "Interoceanmetal."
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor."
It has the power to exploit in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background there is an accident, it's about something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a little potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, who according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages, the German special forces command was at the place of action.
To resolve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for German help - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are being made of the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the action of salvation, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore at the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Criminal Investigation Office also the experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity institution.
As Ministry spokesmen reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted the help of Germany to use it as support on site.
"Fortunately that time did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19, in southern Egypt, the assailants had abducted a group of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
Following the kidnapping of the hostages in the southern desert region of Egypt, they were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown to the end as well as the details of the release or possible rescue payments.
Meanwhile the healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the supervision of the German embassy.
He didn't say any word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild," 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus of the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve of the salvation package
The first chamber of the United States Congress failed with little a large $700 billion saving package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected the government's package for saving the financial markets with 227 votes against 206.
Despite all calls by President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, it did not reach a majority for the program with which the disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With a dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked Members to vote, although the plan was not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he said.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was the concerns of investors that the state salvation package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel reservations for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As the German travel association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel reservations for the winter season the travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more in comparison with the same period last year.
According to research by the GfK market research institute, the reserves for the autumn months had already increased in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost 11 percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed about the reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar, mainly travel to the United States is of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost one third.
The German preferred destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the German regions.
In particular, organized travel is highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel costs are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual journey."
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the travel was well reserved, so that the volume of sales compared to last year went up again - although according to one other study the number of Germans taking a trip, compared to last year, went down.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless spa, the beer in a liter pitcher and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian suits of designers.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, the moderator on TV and wears a traditional Bavarian suit to suit.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is already in use.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're just in the tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the pictures - it's very lisonjero especially because I'm first in Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian suits seem to perform their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in a traditional Bavarian suit until this day was still limited.
But after you get to Teresa's Prado, it's all no big deal.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; none seems to be listening to or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A munitia draws my attention to my apron who was dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind it is widow."
Oh, God, now I'm on my back to the left.
"All right," he says laughing.
The others do not care about many of the subtle methods to flirt and wear caps where it is written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their knot ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, he is from England and is also for the first time in the Oktoberfest.
He looks like "Gorgeous," which he pronounced with a "or" very long. "
He tells me after he put his one-liter-of-beer glass next to him.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most of them think that's a garbage bucket.
So Bob's one of the famous people who can drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock in the night, the health care groups run through the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear every time in a group - all of a sudden there are four people who bring the covers from one tent to the other.
That works like most visitors: they get sober, they get drunk.
You can't see who's suffering from the degree of alcoholemia and is on the way.
"They are the ones who" no longer can, "a health care provider gave me the answer by answering my question and disappeared in tumult.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old peatone who died in the hospital has been identified after being beaten by a vehicle in Essex County.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers were nearing the desire to enter this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to bake the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once the box office was over to the vault, there is no doubt what the greatness of the company was that this was the most western door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
British rule and as the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for the Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917, a train of ammunition exploded by destroying its elaborate roof.
The Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then, the station has been declining and has remained on the sidelines of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's will to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party to the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new partnership policy.
The Turkish Government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I joined a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The following morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shocks, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and "power pastry shops" where middle class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree / do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly, "he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time to the East and the West.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask you, "Turkey could be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he says, "does not want to affront that choice."
He then stresses a point that almost everyone I spoke to so far had recited to me by heart: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again to the Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How much would they have been surprised to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosforo, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt on what the continent will be to which this fascinating country must claim.
Lives to remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as a musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (skis, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chorus.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for those under 21 years of age, but at the time the Proteus sang its end in 1979, several of us were finishing 20 years - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changing forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music that is presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, indifferently if not accompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and all was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So you just have to sing! "
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never tax, or too blossomed.
Whatever the musical scarring, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of your concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by any, been disappointed - otherwise, I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known warhorses all over the world."
We'll miss you so much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his report by William Woodruff (September 25), you say that "in 1946 he resumed his studies of economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research grant from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a PhD degree."
This is learned in a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to ignore this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino" Flamenco and life "because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to their simplicity and the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can catch magic moments. "
Second assault for Honda's supersales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If your predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolumen has an even wider inner space.
In addition, refined mechanics increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a very similar line to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolumen are numerous.
These include innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analysing the new model, we must comment that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced into the market.
Therefore, a first point is that Honda has renewed this model within a shorter period of time than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during 2008.
In Japan, about a million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda aims to allow this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would be 17% growth on the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
It is precisely the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16% decrease.
Despite this increase in Honda sales has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also hopes to achieve 2% by 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota, you are confident of the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters long - that the company expects to market about 200,000 units a year around the world.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in society in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows at all levels.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the inner habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk - with a double-bottom system - is up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the engine 1.4, as the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - are an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol propellants.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves a lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2-litre mechanics has a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. to 4,900 laps.
This propulsion - which in the past Jazz reached 78 horses - has a cost of 5.3 litres and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the previous propulsion, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, it now becomes 100.
This 100-horse Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to move forward in the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flying of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Advanced Technical Centre Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the Security Shield from four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capacity of the brand's vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal, oval-shaped space that looks a lot like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of the bee, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles that are up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an abort microprocessor that immediately results in collision prevention.
"When you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right or greater angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, "explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonal; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to prevent collisions by the small robot.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require to save information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a couple dozen KB memory.
This may be a surprise, but we're not talking about memory gigas, not even mega. "
This is the first step to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan vaticina will be introduced into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles along the way.
Tremble before mortgage
It must be recognized that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on garbage mortgages at questionable solvency banks, they have created an ameno and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the 'Hotel of bad credit'... or of trouble.
The tetrical aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to be thought one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your target.
It is true that you have useful information, but little detail.
It's more of a page for teenagers than a place for all audiences.
What if the game is completed?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
Something's something, because we don't even talk about buying a better house...
Morgan Stanley Sells Participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay out nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in its stock exchange.
One week after an interim agreement was discovered, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of the regular Morgan Stanley shares at a unit price of $25.25, or three billion dollars.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of a unit-of-measure price of $29, or 28 per cent above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley stock lost however 6.79% to 23.07 dollars each at 17: 00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of bank holding," said Juan Mack, the American group's general director.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he makes him pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's larger names to adopt much more prudent behaviour than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained," we thought that participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities by 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert within one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, or at about $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley claims that the capital provided by MUFG will allow him to take investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to give details about the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have very much relieved his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its market share fall by half while the cost of security against a risk of defects over its debt took off.
This cost went back last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised 15 billion dollars, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refounded the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Boliviano Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, as an example of his colleagues and friends, is the third to vote on a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64 per cent of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results of 80 per cent of the votes.
According to these results, "no" received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls on the way out of the electoral centres and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory of "yes," estimated at 63 to 70 per cent.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed in an overwhelming way," he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who lead the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the State's power over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and through foreign exchange that send its emigrants.
The project, led by Correa, elected in 2006, also grants strengthened powers to the head of State, who will be able to make up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million people, in which 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 people abducted have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight captives captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions abducted ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good on their arrival at 15H30 on board a special aircraft to the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they have been unable to speak to the press.
"They are well in health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian tourism minister Zohear Garana said at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in the SUV in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one zulo to another.
The group consisted of 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of the safari organization.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of shots took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said this responsible who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commanders.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by the secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said without going into details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the day, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an SUV on board which the kidnappers were found, of which six were killed, including the Chadian chief and two were arrested.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately rejected by that group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of the fait les manchettes culture and is taking up the current electoral campaign.
It's better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the miserable amounts that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and its heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restoring only the Chinon castle in the Loira Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all the elected and all the government departments, and all this, in consultation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Québec History Societies, at least 40,000 charitable people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned to seek in history, to preserve with little money lots of private archives and to preserve archaeological vestiges.
These are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
By when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The States of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis on the American market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution, which also has business in Hungary, with a total of 11.2 billion euros.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that is taking place in several waves more than a year ago, so the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense, can be seen as precedents.
According to the decision taken in the morning of Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49%) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including mainly the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
The actions of the Fortis began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85 thousand employees this Bank is too big to allow it to break.
The company's shares fell by 12 percent on Friday alone, with this being the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has been reduced by more than two thirds.
Noting the current stock prices, the total value of the group's capital on the market is about 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management attributed the sharp fall in the shares of Fortis to the insecurities of the American market in relation to the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday the actions already showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new general director of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There was no panic among the Bank's clients so far, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Fox in the hens
In the United States, life and health insurance companies are often denied to sign an insurance contract when they see the data from the purchase of medicine.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programmes for the protection of personal data, which, when using the data of the recipes in all cases, binds it to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the hens to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the program to follow up medical recipes.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and the amount of compensation for the customer's state of health dependent and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They previously sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him, already knowing the result of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer's identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of medicines bought in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the customer's diseases and state of health.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol reduction pills, it indicates that the fat level in the blood is almost incurably high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
There are many versions of the program, some even set a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this respect.
Among the disadvantages of the program is, for example, that some medicines are multi-use, for example, certain substances are used to treat both headache and heat waves and even antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk-raising factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, call for the patient's approval.
The authorities already force them to do this, although they did not receive a fine for the negligence of so far.
Some companies have recently also produced the results of the laboratory tests and, together with the drug use data, obtain more accurate information on the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that provides the authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another issue that the person cannot deny his approval, because if the insurance companies do not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, however, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Global menu of Marseilles
European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other problems for the most part global, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
Today, too, a Franco-Indian summit will be held to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit in Marseilles yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they agreed to double in five years, that is to increase their trade to more than 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
They thus legally harmonized the existing twenty-six bilateral civil aviation conventions with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of it - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also called for, although both sides have a strong responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that it will hold on to its energy and climate programme, that is, by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20%.
India also agrees with this, as at next year's climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 per cent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.

There will be a meeting with the stamp at the Room Struktur in the area 5.0 of the Buchmasse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects about the state of the editorials in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of the books of foreign authors gradually decreases on the total Italian production, and in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago.
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, were found while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on a high plane at 3000 metres of altitude, in the area of the Nevada saw of Mammoth Lakes, in the confine between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
The Commissioner of Madera County, John Anderson, has dissipated the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that this is about what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a stamp conference.
The Commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surroundings.
The millionaire, 63 years old, has been considered dead in February.
The American transport safety office (Ntsb) has informed that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squadron of researchers has been sent that has identified the apparatus: it is typical of the Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been interrupted one month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primitives.
In 2002, to the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's turn into an aerostatic balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later, he had made the world's turn by plane and without a stop.
Among their record, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A Suv outside the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and angles.
It is this, in short, that Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Due to the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the exhibition rooms Mercedes-Benz from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the new car's debut will launch an unpublished mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of Milanese shopping, Avenida Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Successively, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be reconstructed in a single image.
Without a doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of car communication.
Can you with this formula capture the interest of future buyers? We will see.
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the prohibition of access to sports events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (in fact few units) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been removed so that they are not identified.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
The Figc had made 144 entries for the party available to the Italian fans: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among what had come out for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) at that time, none that had prohibited him from frequenting a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been denied the ticket and also the trip.
The ministry of the interior now hopes to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) for at least five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) that prevents the participation of not only Italian stadiums but also those of the whole of Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others should be added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they say of the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why, "well-opened eyes" especially in view of Wednesday's National Party in Lecce. "
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italy's support.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The Duce-Duce chorus and the raised arm during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria non is a reato...."
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the ministry of the interior (has taken over the fact that it was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste of public security where there is a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not reluctant to celebrate the Duce but, yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans who have been shameful.
"I do not make the sociologist - it adds the n.1 of the Observatory - the reatos are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
So far this group has been well-behaved now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's anthem: these too are not a reath, but if they allow they are not of education either... "
