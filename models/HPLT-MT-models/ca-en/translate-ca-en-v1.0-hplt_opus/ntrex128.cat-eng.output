Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned that they “identify them as Muppets”
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title for MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has emerged from the plan to change the name of the assembly to that of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a cause for mockery.
A member of the Labour Party assembly stated that his party was concerned that MWP “rigged with Twp or Pwp.”
For readers who are not Welsh: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the party assembly Plaid Cymru has commented that the whole of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh conservative member has stated that his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there is a too small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to name the Members of the assembly will of course fall to the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly all power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to that of the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee opted for "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
The members of the assembly are apparently suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus can be a whole headache for the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their name during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on change of name of country
Citizens will choose whether or not to change their country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed attempts by that country to form part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, contrary to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favor, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
Historically, the elderly I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
Today, there is none left of them.
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
People have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
Bars are no longer that kind of living rooms for the neighbourhood where people go regularly.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as its leaders foresee and that sooner or later they will return to the place where they came from.
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the type of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he says, "and so what they will do will accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that originally existed left during the 30s.
A black congregation nearby acquired ownership of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street merchants, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the lane.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, described the carillon as "the bells of poor people".
The expert who sounded the barrel in July described it differently: “A cultural treasure” and an “unreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first barrel in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest barrel of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded in St. Martin's in recent months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese "pretend to transmit the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while searching for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help. They then rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that it was first thought to be the joy of picking up a lobster, but then realized he was shouting 'They have bitten me!
I was bitten!"
He had his entire clavicle torn,” Hammel observed when he reached the boy.
For everyone to get out of the water, I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted into serious condition.
It is not known what the shark species responsible for the attack is.
At a news conference, lifeguard Larry Giles commented that work for a few weeks had detected a shark in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to market UK beauty products
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product corridors in the style of department stores occupied by skilled employees.
These large corridors are only part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty products market, a market that moves about 2800 million GBP and continues to grow as the fashion and home products sectors are lagging behind, and they will be tested in 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the test becomes a success.
Investment in beauty products is the product of the avidity of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's claims that it will double its beauty offer to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of brands similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the phase of relaunching its range of Boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two stores in Sainsbury's. The first was held last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later that year.
Internet shopping and change towards a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day at small supermarkets has led to large supermarkets having to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight off Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing points of sale of Argos in many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, has served to relaunch food sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's conducted a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but everything quickly ended up not agreeing on how to divide the profits from the chain of pharmacies within supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its 281 pharmacies business in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of skin products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the look of our beauty product corridors in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specially trained workers who will be of great help when offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to fit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones “furious” after Holly Willoughby takes back a deal of 11 million GBP
Dragon's Star' Den Peter Jones went "furious" after television host Holly Willoughby backed a 11 million GBP deal with Jones's lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to engage in the joint business of home products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning's 37-year-old host used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones excited to retire at the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand joint business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great profits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the star blonde on television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at her empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new agreements, worth 1.5 million GBP, meant that she would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of home products and Truly accessories.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source, “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
It was destined to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back down left all parties involved speechless.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there is a store full of goods in the headquarters of Marlow ready to be sold.”
According to the experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions due to the important investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had had an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together. In addition, Jones owns 40% stakes in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones commented last night that “We will not make any comments about your business.”
Hard accusations... “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the possible criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "little of a president's" and for having such a positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking the tone of a news presenter:
I haven’t given up on anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the summit held in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “response in correspondence” by the U.S. to the first disarmament initiatives carried out by its country.
However, he observed, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
We are doing very well with North Korea," he said.
We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help release hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
It is very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to enter this crowded enclosure, we would have about 200,” Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds killed by tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite to be able to catalyze international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding,” says Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not safe even if foreigners can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute to providing assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in case of tsunami, they are not frequent on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in case of tsunami, even if there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake is now heading towards Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo was central to his campaign to improve Indonesia's damaged infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, the Joko government is facing re-election of funding deficits next year.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim bands with machetes, bows and arrows, and other blood weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes the draw goal with a distant shot against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was losing 1 to 0.
The ball was accommodated to the left before releasing an incredible shot aimed at the second stick.
The shot crossed the entire area with a high elevation while propelled towards the right cross of the goal.
The ball finally started the descent above a Kepa Arrizabalaga in the middle of the jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible,” Sturridge told Liverpool.com.
I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and I didn’t think about it much, I just set out to kick.
Chelsea won 1–0 after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue team forward returned from a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost the midfield and sprinting towards Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the midfield.
He then made a magnificent in-depth pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overcame the defence to finish off the second post with a shot with his left leg where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll reaches 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings collapsed due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, according to Sutopo agency spokesman Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was all covered by the rubble of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding woman stabbed
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several stabs on Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the inhabitants of the area to have seen or heard something related to the crime that is presented to the authorities.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "While the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to appeal to everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and would have seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the camera on board the car, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body they found is from Birkenhead and that it was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigations continue, police said they were reporting the events to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he learned what had happened, he was left speechless.
Residents are being notified that they will spend hours until they can re-enter.
It was felt like a police officer told a man that the entire area was treated like a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
He repeats, “It’s terrible!”
At 14:00, two police vans were inside the area arranged with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained inside the cordoned out area controlling the block of flats.
Anyone is asked to have information that can send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously through 0800 555 111 and mention file 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction in the purest style of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for his ancestor's actions during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being commemorated.
Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes an entirely accurate representation remains a subject of historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy to be celebrated and commemorated.
Murdered pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local sources report.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered in blood near a pig court in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines to pigs at a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as is known, he had traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjoining pig court.
According to him, there was a large male pig in the court with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg piglet had mortally wounded the farmer, according to the report.
My cousin had broken legs and full of blood," said the cousin, named "Wu," as mentioned in Guiyang's evening news.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned by Yuan nor his cousin.
One of the market officials commented in the evening news that the pig was locked up and isolated in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence in the scene of the crime.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite being very rare, there have been previously reported cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her Massachusetts farm, and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoban farmer told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They like to play.
They are like children, they are very curious... they do not go with the idea of hurting.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains across the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The Rose had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, eastern US time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving east toward the west coast of the United States. When the Rose approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity northward toward the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical humidity will then interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rainfall throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of around 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that floods will form, as the situation is rapidly worsening due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can bring gusts of wind and dust clouds at specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains at certain points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that total rainfall above 50 mm may be recorded, which could cause minor waste flows and slippery paths.
This would be the first rain of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated rain showers will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
Torrential rains will spread into the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October there will be several major temperature fluctuations for all of the U.S. as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes within a short distance.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to start in October with heat in much of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures are above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers saw Brett Kavanaugh’s statement
More than 20 million viewers watched on Thursday the exciting testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, allegedly taking place in the 80s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was broadcast on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters disrupting Friday's regular schedule due to a twist in events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh hit her drunk and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers have seen this testimony on Friday.
The company had the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems calculating people who see him from his office.
In perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football playoffs match or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most watched chain, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the one-day testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement saying they would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was incredulous by protesters as he tried to climb an elevator to go to a view of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake spent several minutes with his eyes down while he was on television on CNN.
Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
They told him, 'You have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!'
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, he said he would have more to say in view of the committee.
Within a few hours, all the cable and broadcast chains were already broadcasting live the moment when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate to submit it to vote.
Flake said, on the other hand, that he would only do so by understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee for next week, a condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had influence, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing politics” in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and scorning national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, where he states that the proposal that the UK and the EU collect taxes mutually is "entirely absurd".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU team player
Police have arrested a suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was a member of the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison accused of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses in the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted that Wayde was shot dead, according to police.
Its deposit has been set at 350 000 USD, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district forensics office published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department is grateful to the Louisiana state police operating group, the state police criminalization laboratory, Southern University police, and local citizens for the assistance provided in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the forces of the order of the area for their "diligence and for seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Media 1.98 m, he played forward and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
It had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team was "destroyed" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
Things like these are what make you suffer at all times," Wade said.
A volcano spit ash in Mexico City
The ash spit by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within a 24-hour period.
The center was overseeing several trembling and tremors that had occurred recently.
Images on social networks where you can see a thin layer of ash on the windshields of cars in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcano activity located 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favor of independence clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined contrary demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of individuals and detainees held by riot police began to throw eggs and powder paint at them, which led to the appearance of dark dust clouds in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that day, there were clashes with the police, who used their batons to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups sang “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not diminished in this region of independence a year after a referendum was held on October 1, considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a large majority, although the turnout rate was low, as anti-secession voters mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by entering polling stations across the region, which led to violent clashes.
The independence groups camped all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration together with his wife, said that he no longer had much hope that Catalonia would achieve independence.
Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we are stuck," she said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although by little margin, in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties and separatists have suffered to maintain the push this year, since many of their leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained waiting to be judged for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been encouraged by the politicians of both sides.
The tension is only increasing,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the setback in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after ramming a house in a car
Three 33-, 34-, and 39-year-old men have been arrested after a car repeatedly assaulted a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point someone has shot a crossbow against the car.
A move by Menga gives Livingston a 1–0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was victory.
Livingston, who this year had risen in the category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what was just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the club in the Ibrox neighborhood.
Dolly Menga's move made a difference as, with this victory, Gary Holt's team rose to second place, which they shared with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team, on the other hand, continue to win away from home in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers receive on Thursday the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends his undefeated streak to six games in the league, with a Holt as coach who still does not know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of his opportunities in front of the direct game of visitors.
Holt's team should have been ahead of the score long before the goal, as their direct play caused all sorts of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way through the defence, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the goal. Alan Lithgow then sent the ball outside to try to finish off Craig Halkett's pass, which crossed the goal.
The locals were happy to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could put the visitors in trouble on isolated moves.
And that’s how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a foul against the interests of the Rangers and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and finish off from the central part of the area.
Until that time, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but encountered an impenetrable defense and a Liam Kelly goalkeeper who had little work throughout the game.
The stage was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a standoff for merit.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped with his feet an occasion for Scott Pittman and Lithgow topped off another Livingston match play.
The Rangers set out to hang again and again in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for Halkett's alleged entry into the Glenn Middleton replacement, and the other for hands. Both were dismissed.
Livingston “phenomenal”: analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top flight, although much of the credit must be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, after a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be on Menga's side throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as a coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain their level.
They did not know how to create occasions (only once they clearly overcame the local defense), and that the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Aggressive Reception for Erdogan in Cologne
They were all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
The police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25 000 people congregating in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered in the vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard while condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and labeled dictator by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies when confronted by a car
A cyclist was killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, an area with heavy traffic from Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although the paramedics attended the cyclist, he died on the spot.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died in a flight crash on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said their agents are working to identify the man and report the events to the closest relatives.
The street has been cut and deviations have been applied for bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in altercation
Six prison agents have been injured in an altercation in this high-security prison, according to the center's office.
The incident took place in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 09:30 on Sunday, local time, and is still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight inmates have been involved. The riot could be contained on one side.
Officers had to be treated for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman: “We have deployed specially trained prison staff to try to solve an incident produced in Long Martin prison, which is still ongoing.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable to the police and may have to spend even more time in the jail.
At Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, riot police made an appearance in prison to solve a serious altercation in which personnel from the center were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major floods (the areas with drought could be benefited)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of floods.
The national weather service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and close on Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix commented in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression within a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 64 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the national hurricane center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are not at risk of floods, the rain of the Rose could become very good news, since the region suffers a strong drought.
Although floods are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwest region currently suffers a drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rose continued to have hurricane strength Sunday morning, with a maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm force on the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "75 to 150 mm total rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm".
After that, Rose will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona early in the morning of Tuesday with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah well into the night of Tuesday.
The main risk we expect from the Rose or what remains of it are very strong rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwest of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy has been found with stabs in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area around 4:00 am on Saturday, local time.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The agents have called for anyone who can have any kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone to get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered the wretchedness and anger” of the Democratic Party
The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at an election in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered from the petty-mindedness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh stated before Congress on Thursday that he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of having sexually abused her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also made a statement in connection with his claim.
The president said on Saturday that, that day, “the American people saw Kavanaugh’s genius, human quality and courage.”
The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable track record of serving the public,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment while discussing the importance of Republican voter turnout in the mid-term elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn’t run, but I actually did,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for our great candidates everywhere.
Trump argued that Democrats are devoting themselves to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to CNN an assistant to the leaders of the Republican Party.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves hitting the beaches, due to a serious earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday on the occasion of a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast at sunset, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not run right away. That is why they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokeswoman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
About 16 700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where you can see the number of shops and buildings destroyed, turned and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquake series were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the intense Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications “were completely paralyzed and therefore there was no information” of Donggala, Nugroho says.
More than 300 000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
It is already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse," he said.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officers said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a shared fan on social media, you can feel how a man standing on the top floor of a building gives desperate cries of warning to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall bursts out by the sea, taking with it buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread power outage that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
Although the military has begun to send humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacuees continue to need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll for Indonesia's tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where employees took shelter in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the bleak gesture of starting relief work, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and the provision of foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a catastrophe has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the people remained hopeful that the miracle would occur and their loved ones evade the bleak account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child trapped in a sewer was rescued.
On Sunday, the rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional charge,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the parapentist community, he had sent messages on WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
I think that means the messages were not received,” he added.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change to Twitter, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
For a time West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye, and used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurred prior to its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to release its new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the program's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning to him.
I think yes is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," West said earlier this year, while talking about the title of his album with the radio presenter Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has earned his nickname with or without a script and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, when the country is short-lived to mark the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in the Plaza de Tlatelolco that "the military force would never again be used to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He has stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Funds Targeted to AI
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money dedicated to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced AI-related measures, although there is a general lack of formal AI strategy in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s No. 1 in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of AI,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the opportunities for the U.S. to achieve the next big AI discovery,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book titled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that surpassed Othello's American player with the best standings and subsequently served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee assessed previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify future visionaries.
Often, American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, "it's not China that takes the academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
I think permanent residency cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI," he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art artificial intelligence development plan.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences in China grants funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation of Natural Sciences and other U.S. public bodies give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to engage industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the constitution of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month the DARPA has announced an investment of 2 billion USD in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently allocates more than 100 million USD a year to AI research.
In the meantime, no action has been taken in relation to American legislation that was intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians hold referendum to decide whether to change country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the name change to "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a move that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's membership requests to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign makes it doubtful if the minimum necessary participation of 50% will be reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question stated in the referendum paper is: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price that is worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created as a result of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularity at 13 h.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to the 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the name change of the country, which would open the way to join the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with our heads high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev claims that joining NATO will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
Zaev stated that a "yes" would mean the "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another survey, conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard blow to pro-Western government policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, score a goal after dripping the entire Brighton defence
Sergio Agüero and Rahem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in the Manchester City victory by 2–0 in the match played at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a move that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He marched by speed between three defenses of Brighton, destroying what came to pass through the playing field.
Then Agüero was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He drizzled a defense before overtaking a few more on board the Brighton area.
He then made a pass to his left that found Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, which with the right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot that sneaked into the net on the right side.
Agüero has discomfort in his foot," Pep Guardiola, City's coach, told reporters.
We decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to the Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that move, Agüero received the ball in depth in the field of Brighton and
He made a beautiful pass through space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long stick.
The forward of the Sky Blues finished the ball inside the net before exiting the bottom line.
The City faces Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage, at 18:55, in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the fight for the play-off, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get out on the mound of the next Sunday's launcher against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain an advantage match over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek to secure their first division title.
Although we don't play at all, we can at least go out and get to know the atmosphere here, in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play each point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to miss this game?
The Nationals still have to announce an opening launcher for Sunday, but are apparently determined to let Scherzer drop if this situation occurs.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm-up session on Thursday and would launch Sunday, on his usual rest day.
Washington's right-hand launcher has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikes eliminated in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I don’t show up, but I really do. That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all the necessary means, they see their meanness, their bad intention.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control. But we won't give them."
The democrats' mission, he said, is to "resist and obstruct".
And this can be seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged, mean, dirty, and false."
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which led to a strong outcry from the public.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Oh, huh, what?
No, no, no. Wait a moment... This was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, it didn’t surprise me.
After all, I am the last in a series of British parliamentarians who have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he manifested himself with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues with respect to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of the meeting on Friday of the Nottingham Labour Party it was reported that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly that way.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of "more generous and kinder" policies has long been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to turn 180 degrees and take positions that I would never have taken, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which an appeal is made so that my candidacy is not renewed, center policies are denounced and I am told that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I’m impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who have to deal with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they don’t get ragged.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with each motion of "no confidence" or each change in the rules of selection, the party narrows more.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and I have been advised to keep my head low, that it was not so expressive and "everything would be fine".
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by Thatcher's negligent government, which left all my class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local adviser or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt about my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would tell them that at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not directed towards Nottingham Momentum, but towards my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent it from acting, in my opinion, for the benefit of the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayrs lead the lead
Two last-minute trials distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant Tennant's Premiership game.
The Ayrs, who are the only unbeaten team of the ten, occupy the top position on the ranking table.
In the end, the local team prevailed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to make better use of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
The matches we have played so far have tested us and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: "Congratulations to the Ayr, they have taken advantage of the occasions better than we have."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, which Frazier Clima converted, put ahead of the Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, on loan to the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted trial.
Climo extended the Ayr's advantage with a penalty and, just in the middle, scored and converted an essay to put the Ayr's 17-5 score on the break.
But the Melroses began well the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
The party was then interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired in a stretcher, and in the resumption the Ayr re-enlarged the distance with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
Later, Captain Blair Macpherson was admonished with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of one more man's superiority with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of heavy pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a no-ball plate, MacPherson scored a counter-assay behind Ayr's penetrating mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the resumption, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to third-line Gregor Henry to score the fifth rehearsal of the local team.
Still Game series star seems ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move into the hospitality industry, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his long-time comedy partner.
The duo have announced that season nine will be the final season of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from The Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flowering catering sector".
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without a coastline, expects the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters covered with elbows in La Paz.
Public buildings have a navy blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are entangled with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia's landlocked territory, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a 19th-century conflict of resources remains vivid, as is the longing to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia expects the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, waits with a positive attitude for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the ICJ’s resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will dictate in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes set for Monday’s resolution.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The resolution of the TIJ, which occurs only six months after the final allegations were presented, indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any gesture of goodwill by Chile,” he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be very difficult to have conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was exceptionally quick.
Next Monday Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would not eliminate nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a chimera to think that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War can make North Korea kneel ever.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not previously make major disarmament movements.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of large hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to completely protect yourself from the sun, you do not need to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a range of extravagant hats from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been ravaged by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's prominent piece was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide feather-shaped wing that flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jewelled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, bright in color, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete diving equipment, with a tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you follow the great fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The large hats tread the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat, with a wide two-foot wing, which everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread through social networks brought another great creation to the catwalk: a straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed in a swimsuit that carried it.
The dark orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquesmus's La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will come to his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the upper A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students obtained a higher A rating in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curricula from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Competency Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave to the fact that they found it difficult to fill vacancies, 17% were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
Since more and more potential job opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% did not know how to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland there is diversity among schools in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK for the future, by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, you can always choose between a series of languages in independent schools, which have teaching staff specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global commercial environment of the current era, it cannot be denied that languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to watch LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes you will play.
It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said at the Lakers official site.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James will probably play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-match schedule of the Lakers.
I don’t need preseason matches at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled Trump rallies for next week, including visits to sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court is on hold, Trump intends to get support for the next half-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump rally in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing started this week with the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained by allegations of sexual abuse he faces, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote remains on hold for up to a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans run for the delicate November elections to gain momentum.
Therefore, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
Congress control is so important to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while heading for a busy campaign season,” a Trump spokesman said.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday it will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is getting poor results in the polls.
It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him impetus in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows its ambition to keep hopes for Sunday's individual matches alive
After three uneven sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The tilting pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this one.
So which side is the positive dynamic on now?
They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're on a small positive streak," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the shape state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal since tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his lap and put on a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been down two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the match in the 15th hole with a similar cry, the sort that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
You have to make the most of yourself and worry about your own party," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four out of four and make no mistakes.
Moliwood" were the only couple who did not do a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way in which their energy seems to flow to and from the bustling public, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-pieces, who partnered with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they never had a chance to leave.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The foursomes and the foursomes are very fascinating to see from the interactions between pairings, the tips they give and the ones they don't give, and the way a strategy can suddenly change.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reached the Ryder Cup final with a 10-6 score
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the four-balls and four-somes on Saturday with a 10 to 6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave their record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to keep the trophy that he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team in the early morning and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debut to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-pieces, they set a brilliant performance to beat a deflating Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had crawled in two matches on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance sparks, but has lost 19 out of 29 matches in four-balls and four-somes, and seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the four-days of the morning, once again partnered with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all on a pleasant and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for the Americans on Saturday.
They scored a 2–1 win against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history had a team traced a four-point difference to individual matches, although Furyk's team, a champion of the title, only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, a Sunday counter-attack seems to be out of reach.
North Korea declares that it will not unilaterally disarm "in any way" if no signs of trust are appreciated
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying his distrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center, and committing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
However, we do not observe any response in consonance with the U.S.," he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally initiate disarmament.
While Ri resumed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-based" denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as you took measures gradually, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization fully, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first summit between a U.S. acting president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has previously announced that Pyongyang must eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The U.S. insists that denuclearization must first occur and the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "end-of-war declaration," Ri said.
The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are intensifying our distrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party involved in the matter of denuclearization were South Korea instead of the U.S., denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he held last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President Trump called Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but stated that much remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm the total and definitive denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously promoted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but after a few hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and nuclear complex if the United States took "measures in consonance".
He said Kim had told him that the "measures in consonance" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on resting habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of studying throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic observed that students at the world's number one university are often clueless about what it's like to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk on the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, “Why do you tell me all this now in my last year?”
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are explained the basics about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, stated that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, how it affects sports performance to lack of sleep, and the importance of maintaining a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Below, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects it has on health smoking cigarettes," Czeisler said.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students suffer make sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy good quality sleep for long enough should be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask postgraduate students to undertake a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact of putting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1–0 defeat at Livingston's home that is yet another match outside.
The Ibrox team sought to add their first home victory since last February's victory by 4 to 1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team adrift, 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime, and never seemed to have the Rangers, lacking inspiration, about to match the score.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rise to third place, behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as Line Judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that appeared to be thrown from the stand.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that swept the Ayrs in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven starters who started a point against the Hearts last week. He was probably satisfied by the way his well-organized team stifled its rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the match, when Menga's first appearance left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder kicked off and missed the great occasion.
A heavy foul throw by Keaghan Jacobs clashed with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow shot only a diverted shot at the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a fifteen-minute penalty, as he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two shots to goal in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's headstroke and the docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While Livy's first act in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only for their effort.
Once again, the Rangers could not deal with Jacobs' work play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a single endgame.
Gerrard acted on the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. The change had an almost immediate impact, as the end made a move to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingstones continued to capture the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after another.
Holt's band may have yielded direction to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow shot off from the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton still called for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day that the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
Counter Geiger, which has been a pillar of science since then, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed cowboy physicists:
Home: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can listen to the effects of atoms emanating from radioactivity to minerals."

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and eliminate malignant cells
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can “see” a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer that she had suffered for more than 18 months disappear.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, subsequently, re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein “promotes the growth of various types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was called up to the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After his third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
Whenever I talk to white people, they tell me: How can you like Trump if he is racist?
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated between frames because of the cap he was wearing.
I was threatened between frames.
They told me not to come out with that cap on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while saying that the Superman layer would be put on because they couldn't tell him what to do.
Try to love.”
His comments provoked the audience's screams at least twice and the members of the show's team seemed embarrassed, Variety said, that there was a reporter who explained in the post: "The entire study was completely silent."
West was brought on as a last-minute substitute for Ariana Grande, whose former rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left a large part of the audience perplexed with the performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier’s bottle.
West got the support of the conservative group leader TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE M crowd."
But the talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and who he is absolutely wonderful."
But I chose not to reward someone (buying their music or clothes or supporting their “art”) who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
And we too," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music was changed to a symbol and later to the artist previously known as Prince.
Accusation of murder in attempted stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder in an attempt after a man was stabbed on Friday in East Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackmore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for portraying the swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of a virile hero, stating that these roles imply that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times’ Culture magazine, Kit said he believed “something had gone wrong” and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married the co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she is strongly determined to face this problem.
Personally, now I wonder where we are wrong about masculinity,” he says.
What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?
According to Kit, television can be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its virile characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have this facet of virility?
I think it is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because there’s certainly something wrong with young boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for next summer, saying he is fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best thing that has given him Game of Thrones.
I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life forward,” she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China warns of 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only 40,000 new cases were declared in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike previously.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has been reduced almost to zero, according to Chinese health officials’ statements at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Considering the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many transmission of disease is due to the lack of appropriate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from Republican senators and dismantled “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information of three Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the lawsuits were driven by far-right critics and websites.
Lies, lies, and more deceptive lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by someone unknown in the Capitol during a Senate hearing on sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to Waters's office and that it revealed information from a member of Waters' staff, denounced the Capitol.
This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure lie," Waters continued.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent complaints, was not in any way responsible for such information filtering.
This unfounded denunciation is utterly false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
This denial is full of indignation,” Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that he does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You do not have to question the motives of the accuser.
You have to keep calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to overthrow Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
Important if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
We will make sure that the criminals are revealed, he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions they have carried out and that they have harmed each and every one of the members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's limited spy parody
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this replacement of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Is this humorous autosaty about how despicable we are going to be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent out-of-ear and rubber-faced Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to twist everything. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the inaugural London Olympics 2012.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson who represented Barclaycard's now-forgotten TV commercials, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There is one or two good times on this last JE journey.
I loved the Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the propeller blades were ringing in his helmet.
You see the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems rather loose and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the mute gags of the character Mr. Bean who represents Atkinson.
The repeatedly clichéd premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the dismay of the service agent, a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character set by Teresa-May, but the script does not come to an end.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And that includes clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a teacher at some luxury institution, but teaching unofficial classes on how to become an undercover agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his hectic sufferer Bough, a role played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, when things get very ugly in the secret service of His Majesty, come into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular “femme fatale” Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous insanities: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a fast food restaurant, they sow chaos by smuggling aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English provokes a great deal of confusion when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarise themselves with the interior of Volta’s house.
All the stops have certainly been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it seems like a children’s program.
Pretty normal things.
As with the other films of Johnny English, it has not been helpful to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan by which the British will work four days a week and will charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the bosses of the companies to spend the savings obtained with the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers by giving them one more day of celebration.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the economic agenda of the parties and the plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The change to a four-day working week is supported by the Trades Union Congress trade union confederation as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour Party source stated in The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the party’s perspective of balancing the economy for the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration together today.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: “A four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The minister's shadow plans also imply that shareholders of water companies may not recover all investment, as the labor government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains in "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their minds.
The FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question as to whether the findings of the agency could influence any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, the correspondent of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could bring to light something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
I'm serious," Kennedy said.
In the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined and safe."
But Graham's vote seems to have been cast on fire.
I have my opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and would present an explosive indictment," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett absolutely denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people he appoints will be able to verify it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, which presents an absolutely impressive program of stars, carrying out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively helping to combat it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless someone wants to pay a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What achievements has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case than we call "clictivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have helped to achieve several goals.
It states that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce comparable commitments and policies to more than 37,000 million USD, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that protected funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and filmmaker association, which pledges to “help children grow as much as possible” and promises to send Rwanda US$35 million to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” said The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions asking the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F’s website asking, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied, “It will be a long and hard road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, presenting Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "lock" to hinder Russian energy exports.
Washington may, "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting the markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
The United States has the ability, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block them, to prevent their energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "power consumer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed equal.
The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come while the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the "inadequate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump says made Berlin "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost 11,000 million USD and will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110,000 million cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization of the German sector, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has appealed to the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will "consider" her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “think carefully” her candidacy for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government’s fracturing, for women to hold senior positions,” he said.
After 6 November, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "taking the country in the wrong direction".
I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "It is clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be submitted by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters have said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the bid.
The survey revealed wider support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would disclose his decision officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites TEPT Track Palin affected at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
With what my own son has been going on since he returned, I can understand other families suffering from PTSD ramifications and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers are returning to,” Trump told the audience at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "they come back a little different, they become hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented an amicus curiae on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions case lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" attacked her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the US, as countries that face widespread band problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine stated on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require that asylum claims be awarded according to the facts and particular circumstances of the lawsuit, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant further asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
Asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
The atmosphere is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she reassured her son with fever in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There is a lack of drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take their belongings flooded and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as the patients are treated outside due to repeated heavy shocks.
Tears denied him his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
I was stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a village wedding.
I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of harassment with "propaganda ads".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in a US newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump turned to the payment supplement of China Daily at The Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of indulging in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, an accusation that China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to emmit itself in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of Washington’s campaign to escalate pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to insert ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is escalating and has seen mutual import tariffs rise.
China’s vengeful tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters of states, such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's redoubled the harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
By divulging its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of free speech and free press by inserting a paid ad in The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
On the other hand, in the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese citizens may have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China dodged the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans remove voters from women before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the leading Republicans support and defend the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) last-minute pressures for an FBI investigation are enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" (November is approaching) as they marched in the Senate lobby while Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be left out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
People say they've already been tall; that's true.
But it could have been more so, especially among voters of women from smaller suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote while they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing his sexual assault claims to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed with confirmation.
This has become a mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
It’s not just about the vote of the board or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the defendant’s bench. It also has to do with how Republicans have handled this issue and how they have treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, said in a statement.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford stele and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance leaning slightly towards the last.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had lied probably or unquestionably during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the lawsuits brought by Ford and at least another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the influence of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez denounces that the Supreme Court candidate taught him the genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the website, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was "to dominate the world".
We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They’re all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive of the personal online data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data”.
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, is for the company to integrate adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer contributors.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely emptied overnight.
We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the I GM's Victoria Cross
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren uncovered a commemorative tombstone at a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and guns".
He later ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage" he advanced the line before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot down by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were a feat he could never match, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who slept all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you stay awake all night to see Bellator 206 and be denied the most important event.
The San Jose poster contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and had to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the showdown, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted by having spent the night awake until the morning to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change for cartoons as "a kind of vomitive joke".
Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa the pig, yes.
The company’s president, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
But there it is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to resolve it until Sunday at our own time, Monday at yours.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were many messages coming and going, and not all were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise not to happen again.
We will leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it again by the fans, but it was over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to other people because of his sexuality, but this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete has stated that he did not realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had left him the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
The usual host of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" others because "it was not socially acceptable as boys and girls."
Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give “hope” to other people.
The world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it caught me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you are so young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple were parents in June of a child to whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "the whole perspective" has changed.
If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold,” he said.
There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is called the same as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he should die and one of the last things he asked was if he already had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn’t tell him “Father, you won’t be there to occupy the first row,” he said.
While holding his hand, he stopped breathing and it was not until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
I knew that this was what I had dreamed all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at an Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud by Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which still put his hen's skin on him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worse Mickelson showed up for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his physical condition if he doesn't want to become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to beat a record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s “fourballs” and “foursomes” modalities.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has been usual for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments divides his time between being an animator and working on his game in the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the peak of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal choice for Le Golf National’s difficult career, where the long rough usually punishes deviated shots.
And if his own career is not sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the precise champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual matches, start strong, Mickelson's party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
He perfectly understood his role for that day, turned a palm in my back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams earlier and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a race in the Ryder Cup that has not matched your individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, joking, he likes to mock people and he’s a great companion for the team,” he said.
I think the younger players also had fun getting in with him this week, which has been fun to watch.
It brings a lot more to your game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage may soon fade away
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of Ryder Cup last day can easily become a tough day.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, when the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the American team, but in the end they achieved the minimum victory, 14.5-13.5.
You keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little,” Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the scoreline at 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History has taught me and all the members of the team that it is not yet over.
Tomorrow you have to go to all the machines.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This does not end until the points are raised to the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I have already said that, I focus on the 12 players that we have in the team, but I also have in mind who are our rivals: the best players in the world.
Enchanted with the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: “I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but individual matches put your ability to play golf to the maximum.
This is the message you need to convey to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this moment, leave your partner and he must go out and also get the best out of himself.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than in a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk meets both sides of the coin on the last day's comebacks, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before eventually losing to the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
I remember exactly all the words,” Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, answered the question.
Tomorrow we have 12 major matches, but we want to start off well, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is challenged to try to start the comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities,” Bjorn says about his selection for individual matches.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the former warships of the Cold War era, but it will not do so until at least next year as a result of faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technology against poaching actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the vanguard ships, which were expected to be able to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was already news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons why it has been returned, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" would weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached an astonishing 3,100 million euros (3,600 million dollars) from an initial budget of 2,200 million euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, given the recent warnings that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used".
The officer has stated that the situation has worsened over time because old ships were no longer used, but no replacements were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spys on the secret lives of bats
A new research carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
The findings are expected to provide new data on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists at the Scottish National Foundation will follow soprano and common bats, as well as northern and water-eared bats at Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track bat activities during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Analysis of the sound of recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed image at the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor at the Scottish National Foundation, hopes the results show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do the paper mats and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco localization technique to place insects and obstacles in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with the right training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues on a regular basis.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve on the Three Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's administrator, David Thompson, states that it is the ideal territory for the species.
Here in Threeve, we have a big area for bats,” he says.
We have old buildings, many old trees and a whole good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It stresses the importance of checking if there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks on properties, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said: “We still have to learn a lot from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data on their population.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the allegations of rape against him are “fake news” and has stated that people “want to become famous” thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the allegations.
Portugal's striker and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 at the time for the incident not to be made public, according to information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video that targeted its 142 million followers after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo claimed they were "fake news".
No, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner on camera.
They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it’s part of my job.
I am a happy man and everything is in order,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have described as “unacceptable information about private life,” according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino suite.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed in the Clark County Courthouse, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good guy", except for a "1%".
The documents argue that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but were consented.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and was taken photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courts because he was "fear of reprisals" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman claims to seek to annul the deal as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he signed for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘would always regret’ losing car manufacturers
The UK would “always regret it” if it lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota’s UK base has stated to the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in case of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
My point is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with other EU countries will work has aroused fears from other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in case of no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is made on a “just in time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European Union suppliers for automobile manufacturing.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a result.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
We have to come to an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
Tests not only by Toyota, but also by other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long the production would stop, but in the long run it has warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union at the plant, has stated that the members begin to be very concerned about the situation: “By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never return.”
A government spokesman said: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for a week" as the struggle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues in White House statements on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and Trump’s aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fired the Deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk, he fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate court hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be delayed another week for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists could refute this claim: Sanders has not done any White House briefings since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information was not because he did not like the fanfare of television journalists, although he said, "I will not deny that they are fanfares."
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
The president does more question and answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, before adding the following without citing any source: “We have consulted these data.”
Sanders has stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but “if the press has the chance to ask the president directly, it’s far better to talk to me than to talk to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and will replace the briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on an official visit.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, at times, strange to the assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to the EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service in the wake of fears for Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes it to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of state of residence applications for EU citizens working for delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be directed towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know these are turbulent times for all of you.
Therefore, I wanted to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU colleagues, and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service, while benefiting patients and the communities we deal with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie of the Tennessee State Tigers has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told the press that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
He came to the band line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing it on a stretcher and taking it for further testing.
A Tennessee State official has reported Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five spots on Saturday before leaving the match, which totalled 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the Conservative Party’s new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taxed on those people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Finance expects to get up to £120 million annually to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to tax a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK and that money will be used to help homeless people, a move that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement by attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taxed on those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will be allocated to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate applications, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to obtain up to £120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of London's newly built properties are non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to make their way to the property scale.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “phantom cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in the timbre tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the large buildings of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel affordable home quotas to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as rent controls and termination of “blame-free” evictions.
It also wants to give more power to the city councils to build new homes.
Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for overseas-based companies, to buy housing compared to hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of having a home in property is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes everything even more real.
Jack Ross: “My greatest ambition is to train Scotland”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his “highest ambition” is to be Scotland’s coach at some point.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once as a supporter and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it's always something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in training clubs, though.”
Ross' predecessors in the position of Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he does not feel pressure to be next on a list of names enshrined in such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be whether I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that their place is the Premier League,” he said.
It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I’ve been successful here if I can bring the club back.
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching staff.
He helped the Alloa avoid relegation to the third category and transformed the St. Mirren from fighting for salvation to championship champions the following season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled on accepting the position at the Alloa.
I had always believed that training was what was best for me, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I got out of it reasonably and enjoyed pretty good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you have to overcome every week.
I still do it in aspects such as stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I’ve been an adult.”

The perfect time for a comb is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave has shot consumption in bars with difficulties in Britain, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have risen by 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has fallen by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the financial consultancy CGA, the company that has collected the data, states the following: “The continuous hours of sunshine and England’s participation in the World Cup, which has been longer than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to that of June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have obtained the best results, while the consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered with the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of the leisure and hospitality analysts RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of large social or sporting events remain the main factors related to the sales of the external leisure market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% year-on-year would be especially harmful, rather than continuing pressure on costs.
This long and hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for businesses serving food and time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide that much-needed breath.
The total increase in the sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, indicating the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of more than £9 million and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that are hidden from their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in the “false Insta” pages
News has raised fears about sexual content publishing
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in the “false Insta” accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about sexual content.
20% of students say they have a net “main” account that they show to their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, of which half have admitted that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "athletes' voices" in the Scottish athletics federation's directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation directive at the organization's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's highest-rated field and field athlete and president Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from his dilated international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh has the respect of the Scottish, UK and worldwide athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm looking forward to acting as a voice for athletes and I hope to grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote the following on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It has been exhausting, but I have recovered completely, I have learned to walk again and today it is time to do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
An ad that compares mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
An online publishing company has divided opinion with an advertisement comparing lactating mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent stripping that can be brought from the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has issued an advertisement inspired by a prank music video to show the freedom that the new stripping gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of fodder and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as: “Yes, I milk myself, but you will not see any tail” and “If you had not noticed, they are not braziers, but my breasts”.
The return goes on: “Pump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, milk the girls.”
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, of which many claim to show the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth," one person wrote.
The Elvie strip is discreetly hidden in a breastfeeding tray (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented on the following: “Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a strip for mothers who do keep their babies?
Another user added, “It’s an out-of-place advertisement.”
Other people defended the announcement; a woman admitted that finding the song was "fun".
I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the strip made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but you have to take it as it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented as follows: “It’s a fun ad intended for mothers who pumped out with throwaways (usually in their workplace or in the toilet and feel like they were cows.
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the thrower discreetly into the drawers.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women feel as if they were cows when using the strip.
However, the Elvie strip is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding tray, which gives women more freedom to move, hold babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and early childhood developer, said: “Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
By tracing the parallels between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a strip is used and the challenges involved in doing so, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new strip.
This is not the first time Elvie has appeared in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children, silently moved to a tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though monthly entries across the border have remained virtually stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid to put their chances of staying in the country at risk if they decided to take in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer in the Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80% of the people who have hosted or lived in the home of a person who has hosted are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people,” said Albence.
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to stand in court within a month after being held, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of personally, to defend their case to obtain the legal status in front of an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered eligible for help will be deported immediately.
The longer children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent cramps or attempted flight, according to workers and reports released by the system in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, the signs indicating that a child is suffering are overlooked.
They added that moving children to camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or saying goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “the matter will be dealt with accordingly.”
They must be removed immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war of terror practically ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory” from both terrorist groups and from “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the ground of a country hit by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
U.N. diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone on the last large rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has remarked that the agreement has clear deadlines and has expressed the hope that military action will confront the jihadists, which include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to begin to outline a post-war constitution and prepare the way to the elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted from "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump will win the election again in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, the scandals and the dismissal process end with his presidency prematurely.
What would be, without a doubt, the end of a more dramatic presidency in history.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in peak hours has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, since 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show”, of the MSNBC, has led the audiences of cable television with up to 3.5 million viewers in the main news nights.
People have been thrown into it because they don't understand it," said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's series "Designed Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?” he asked.
He answered me because it made him laugh,” Scovell told me.
There is a point of entertainment in the chaos.
Unlike television programs, the Washington script could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you are in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of sources “for private use” for his book “Fear”, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich skin jacket (“a piece of thick clothing like his pride,” the Washington Post titled) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels’ horrific descriptions of Trump’s anatomy.
In my case, I will never see Super Mario again.
Part of what makes it appear to be part of a reality show is that every night it gives you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the character changes and script twists of Trump’s show (fighting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're left behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house he had on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up looking at the MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be disengaged, not with Brett Kavanaugh on the verge of facing the Senate court committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
I remember when we did those crazy shows then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
I thought it would be a joke, but it looks like they were right.

External money floods half-legislative election races in the House of tighter representatives
It is no surprise that there is a cash flood in Pennsylvania's 17th arrondissement, thanks to the re-alignment of the congressional districts that has made two current members have to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburgh involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who comes into conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decreed in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main party financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a very successful special election in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on the Salvador for his support of China, but withdraws them.
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions to the Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for the “recent decisions on quitting recognizing Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the department, this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received US aid of $140 million in 2017, was contemplated, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll from murder and unemployment.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials from the administration clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any likelihood of sanction for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration gives to it, diplomats say.
The three envoys returned discreetly to their posts in the Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman in Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations from anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event to occur could be special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in public records.
As far as it is known, Mueller also investigates whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be held accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s downfall, or any of his European namesakes, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both shores of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
By 1938, German officers were willing to make a coup against Hitler, only if the western bloc had resisted him and had supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over turning points like this and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States is currently facing several turning points.
What happens if Trump dismisses Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water on his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for the post.
Rosenstein claims that the Times's information is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to be in danger.
But I don’t think we will fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light sabbatical candles on that table with the swastika.
With this background, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans, of the Rangers, optimistic for the match against the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw in the Villarreal field this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the G group of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing in the first minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal are a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
We played the game believing that we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten something more out of it in the end, but in general, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second half.
On Thursday, it is another great European night.
We hope to be able to stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we will give everything and we will achieve a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it is a good place to be.
The team is good and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give everything, leave behind last season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with their family.
Approximately half of respondents nationwide say they have spoken to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents said they spoke to their children.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t dare raise it,” said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the life insurance company Nationwide.
You have to start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your expenses or your own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut off from legal battles.
Find a representative to be able to designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that the professionals meet your wishes in case you can not communicate.
Also consider hiring a notary for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid in case of incapacity.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old family member has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also with which doctors it is to be treated," Martin said.
What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
Man shot several times with a compressed air shotgun at Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots of a compressed air shotgun as he returns home after leaving for the night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers have described the shooting, which occurred around 2.30 a.m. (at British summer time), as a "random act".
The victim has not seen his attacker.
His life is not at risk for injuries and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
As communications are cut, the relief units have not been able to obtain information about the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Celebes province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast at the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami occurred west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and earthquakes often occur there.
Below are the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook an area of pop from the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai off the Sumatran coast, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died from the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, 29, born in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she stretched her phone.
Palin is detained at the temporary detention centre in Mat-Su, where he is held with an unsecured obligation of USD 500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he declared himself, according to this chain.
Palin faces three Class A fouls, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B foul, which can be punished with a day in prison and $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaskan court of veterans.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic aggression, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication in relation to the incident.
His partner stated that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for exceptional death penalty for New York terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and storm pedestrians and cyclists during his journey, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed all eight victims and that "disproportionate" caused serious personal injuries, in accordance with the intention of requesting the death penalty presented in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court’s document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with an indictment with 22 fouls including eight charges of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in Mafia cases, as well as a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last time the southern district of New York brought to trial a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show regret in the days and months after the attack.
Police said they said they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
According to police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be deployed in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to the accusation of 22 wrongdoings.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders who represented Saipov, stated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
We believe that the decision to sue for the death penalty, rather than accepting a statement of guilt and a life sentence with no possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.

Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The previous UKIP leader has stated that politicians should "feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own members of parliament has suggested that she should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP without charge Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that Britain would already be outside the EU if Mr. Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when conservatives in favour of union have come forward in another protest against Brexit in The City.
The prime minister is struggling to preserve her Chequers engagement plan between Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
The Allies insist that they will reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure the Euroskeptics and the Conservative Party to choose between their package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would be out,” he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must undo Chequers' commitment."
To specify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is totally false."
Brexit Conservative supporter Andrea Jenkins also attended the march and said to reporters, "I just call you, Prime Minister, to listen to the people."
Chequers' commitment is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out and get us to win an election.
Abandon Chequers' commitment and start listening."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that the politicians of the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not allow them.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
We are mobilizing the popular troops in this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists stirred banners about conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
These are the people who tell us they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus deal, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of running as a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will examine the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been a center of speculation on the possibility of relieving Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked if he planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren responded that it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for the shooting of Sims by the LSU
Baton Rouge police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting of basketball player from the LSU Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head who eventually killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday in the media for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody in the East Baton district police department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the world title after the team's orders handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxes earlier and left Hamilton running with the traffic on the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at the boxes and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheeled action that caused the Ferrari rider to leave the free inner part with the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started on the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap he was in seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race as he retained his wheels to save time, advance on Kimi Raikkonen and move on to fourth position.
He finally entered the boxes on lap 44, but was unable to increase the pace in the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team did a fantastic job of having one-two,” Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people are "bad, cruel, and liar".
Something that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in recent days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, bad, cruel and liar people," he said.
When you look at the releases and leaks and say, "No, it wasn't me.
I wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... Did you filter the document?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn’t filter it,” she added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh of Ford in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter her story," Feinstein told The Hill.
He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the rally on Saturday night: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to have power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the Elite's defeat on Friday against the Belfast Giants, as they won the return match 5–3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two- goal lead thanks to the finishes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie climbed the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard equalled the Dundees. Two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came from winning the Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants that had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assist. Four minutes later, with assistance from David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan placed the home team back in the game at the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt provided the equalizer at the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage in the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
Air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after his death to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake rocked the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are taking place in the area and there are many people trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, although his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the trembling control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that the Batik 6321 flight, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take the flight.
He then left the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative from Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
That broke our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are bringing aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against the clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that will crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although it was previously said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, from Saturday afternoon, they did not find a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find it.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the U.S. airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane drenched in the lagoon because the runway was short.
Some witnesses think that the plane passed the runway over.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
This was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he himself and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the plane's emergency exits, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants were panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a slight wound in his head.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport affected people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night that burned a woman alive
The prosecution concluded on Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippian woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the defendant's 29-year-old movements, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, as his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Telephone records indicated that they had only been known for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
She erased it from her life," Hale said.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass into the hands of the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put conscious hip-hop back into fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY Babysitter Demands Couple for Dismissal After "Racist" Message
A New York City nanny has denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misguided text message from her mother protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed dismay at seeing that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
Nooooooooo Another Black Person," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her pipe, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that the nanny who had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and then sent her home with an Uber.
Maurice now demands compensation from the couple for the dismissal and asks for compensation of approximately 350 USD a day for the work with a six-month residence for which he had been hired, although there was no contract.
I want to show you that you can't do things like that," he told the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination.
The couple have responded to statements that they are racist by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after having offended her.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people," said her husband, Joel Plasco, in the post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the lawsuit to an "extortion", claimed that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude," the investor banker added.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and condemn their behavior and their logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's place who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It's funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the rejection of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "aggresweet", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and adds that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
He was a discreet man; he wasn't a presumptuous man," he said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son got something: you pride yourself, even if it's not your thing.
I think he considered Paddington's success like this.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always used to recognize Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
On landing, they took their daughter quickly to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Nad often called to say it was very serious and he didn't expect it to get over it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad and he told me he would die in the next two minutes and he had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said to him, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll go with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs he had been given to keep his body beating were being consumed and were coming out of his system.
He had died earlier than planned, and that's how it all turned off.
I just had to sit down and wait, as I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and more people.
I had to keep the good shape.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience that was going on.
No one knew,” he said.
He had his head cut and tears kept falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her very much."
Women of mourning hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, was killed.
I don't want any parent to feel what I have to hear every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, based in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was at a "very dark point."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am continually concerned that there is a collateral effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "so that people know there are people who can come, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her companion for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
He never said he wasn't well or that he was depressed or anything like that," he said.
A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He touched the background on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and he did not look them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to work on it: "Open a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is sustained by a thread as the FBI begins an investigation
I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday. He also added that he feared the committee would be destroyed with the deeply-rooted stalemate of supporters.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks left for the mid-term elections on November 6. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will be weak in getting the man they want to be elected to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea "falls" with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification said 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and rising prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Normally, the vast majority of deserters in the North are offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul sources say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriating them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to get a Korean peninsula free of nuclear energy.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Without trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and is not fit to work in the High Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh High Court is a "hysterical" and that her temperament incapacitates her from working in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I can’t help thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her that she is a “hysterical,” Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the allegations of having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and running out of words while talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats and said the allegations against him were "a grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not work in the High Court, as he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, whether it is confirmed, and whether Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only qualified to be in the High Court, but also in the court where you are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the Court of Appeal for the Columbia District Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he evaded questions about whether he would override certain decisions of the High Court.
It is not time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Court and wait for it to seem wonderful to us," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and cannot be removed without crying.
We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
I don't think it's uncommon, and you?"
She continued... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me she was also crying when angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to: "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
It seemed brilliant to me."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a male majority, where I once ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a older woman (a cold manager who had always terrorized me a little) who grabbed me from the neck and dragged me to the eye of the staircase.
Never let them see you crying," he said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad, because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Democrat in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a presidential candidate.
It wasn't a well-considered decision," he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "White and the Seven Dwarfs"
As he arrived late in the campaign, he was lagging behind with fundraising, promising that he would not enter the race if he did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for targeting voters, rather than the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she ran out of words.
You might have thought she had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press reaction.
You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
Did he cry?"
How Trade War Between the US and China Can Benefit Beijing
The initial salvoes of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the war does not seem to end soon, a long-term disengagement can be beneficial for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed taxes on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth 200,000 million USD. These tariffs amount to a tax on half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has been counter-attacked each time in the same way and has recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent for $60,000 million of American goods.
China has committed to replicating the US and it is not likely that the second largest economy in the world will be back soon.
Making Washington back requires giving in to some demands, but publicly bowing down to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, trade war pressures with the US could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had predicted,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centered research associate at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
Before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime is grateful for any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team won the crown again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points necessary to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the blow out of the water in the hole par 3 16, which yielded the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his series and became one of the four players who have achieved the 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was removed with a 5&4 by the least qualified player from Denmark's European team Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
I’m not crying, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... And I'm happy to have been able to help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
This morning there was a time when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought.
I take my hat off for Thomas.
He is a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to have been their captain.
There is something to remove your hat.
They defeated us."
