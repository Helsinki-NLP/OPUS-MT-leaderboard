Members of the Welsh assembly concerned that "identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposed modification of their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen as a result of the plan to change the name of the assembly to that of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all different political parties have shown concern that this measure may become a motive for mocking.
A member of the Labour Party assembly stated that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "rhymed with Twp or Pwp".
For readers who are not Welsh: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly has commented that the whole of his party “does not see it with good eyes” and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh conservative member has stated that his group was “open” to the change of name, but also commented that there is a too small difference between the term “MWP” and “Muppet”.
In this context, it must be said that the letter “w” in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the letter “u” in English of Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: “The final decision on any qualifier to call the Members of the assembly will fall on the members themselves”.
The Wales Government's 2017 Act grants the Welsh Assembly full power to change their name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to that of the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee opted for "Welsh Parliament Members" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that received a wider support for public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, however, the attempt to reach a consensus may be a headache for the president of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on changes in a matter of weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their name during the debate on legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on the change of name of their country
Citizens will choose Sunday if they want or not to change their country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted for decades with the neighboring Greece, who already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way to claim their territory and has repeatedly opposed attempts by this country to be part of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, contrary to the plebiscite on the name change, has stated that it will ignore voting.
However, those who are in favor, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
Historically, the elderly with whom I have spoken say that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Today, there is none left, both of them”.
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
People have another way to socialize today,” he says.
The bars have already ceased to be that type of living room for the neighborhood where people went periodically”.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as the one foreseen by their leaders "and that sooner or later they return to the place where they left".
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condos with the type of people who will not be of any help for the temples remaining in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be white-breeded," he says, "and therefore what they will do will be to accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is absolutely unlikely that most people who move to these condos end up being members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left during the 30s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the rail.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin's Church, described the entire carillon as "the bells of poor people".
The expert who rang the train in July described it differently: “A cultural treasure” and an “unreplaceable historical instrument”.
The Michigan University expert Tiffany Ng also observed that it was the world's first black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest lane in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded at St. Martin's in recent months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote in the diocese last July expressing his concern that the diocese “to transmit costs” to the council, although the latter was not involved in the recruitment of architects and trustees that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
A shark hurts a 13-year-old boy while searching for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to search for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 am near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on San Diego's KSWB-TV, he spent half an hour diving with some friends on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of a boy begging for help, and then rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says it was first thought that it was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then she "aware that she screamed 'I've been bitten!
They have bitten me!
He had all the clavicle torn,” Hammel observed when he reached the boy.
For everyone to get out of the water, I cried out, 'There's a shark in the water!'', adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in serious condition.
It is unknown what shark species are responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, lifeguard Larry Giles commented that work had been detected a shark in the area for a few weeks, but it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to the beaches for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas due to research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, towards the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to do the competition in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with corridors of beauty products in the style of large stores occupied with specialized employees.
These large corridors are only part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the UK, a market that moves about 2800 million GBP and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors are left behind, and 11 stores across the country will be tested to expand to more stores next year if the test becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products is the result of the avidity of supermarkets to take advantage of the space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's claims to double its beauty offer to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of similar brands that can be found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the relaunch phase of its range of Boutique makeup products so that most products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The Fragrance Shop retail chain will also open concessions to two stores in Sainsbury's, the first one last week in Croydon, south London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the change towards a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt at the supermarket chain to fight against discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos points of sale in many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, it says, has served to relaunch grocery sales and increase the profitability of purchases.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch their beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's conducted a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s but everything ended up hasty by not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmacy chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy arrives after the sale three years ago from Sainsbury's of its 281 pharmacy business in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of leather products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: “We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product corridors in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in workers trained specifically who will be of great help when offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of shopping”.
Peter Jones “furious” after Holly Willoughby gets back from a 11 million GBP deal
The Dragons star' Den Peter Jones left "merciful" after the television presenter Holly Willoughby came back from a 11 million GBP deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to engage in the joint business of household products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' star Den Peter Jones infuriated by retiring in the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand joint business to focus on her new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring you great benefits.
According to several sources, Jones was “furious” when the TV star blonde admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new presenter agreements, worth 1.5 million GBP, meant that he would no longer have enough time to dedicate to the joint brand of household products and Truly accessories.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When 37-year-old Willoughby used Instagram to announce Truly's departure, Jones took a private plane in the direction of one of his holiday residences outside the United Kingdom.
According to a source: “Truly was by far the main priority of Holly.
It was destined to be its long-term future and where we would see it for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to go back left all the parties involved speechless.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.”
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes for the home, and the possibility of delays in their launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined in the post of president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together and Jones has 40% stakes in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the I'm A Celebrity programme at the ITV.
A spring near Jones commented last night that “We will not make any comments about their businesses”.
Hard accusations... “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the possible criticism he would receive from the media to comment that some would consider "little of a president" and to have such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump stated, mocking a news presenter's tone of voice:
I have not renounced anything.”
He observed that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards North Korean denuclearization.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are stagnant.
More than three months after the summit held in June in Singapore, the high North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” by the US to the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
However, he observed, the U.S. continued to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
We are doing it very well with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we maintain this great relationship”.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help to release hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relationships with Kim.
It is very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10 000 people trying to enter this area full of people, we would have about 200,” Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite to being able to catalyze international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding,” says Mrs Sumbung.
While Save the Children are organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not safe even if foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute to offering aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country unfortunately remains unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in case of tsunami, they are not frequent on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in case of tsunami, even if there was a warning in force, it is very likely that it has contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to attend the victims of the earthquake is now heading towards Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia's damaged infrastructure, and has invested enormous amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government is facing the next year to re-election of financing deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of the battles that take place in the streets between Christian and Muslim bands with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes the tie goal with a far shot in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with his goal scored in the minute 89 Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea goal when his team was losing 1 to 0.
He accommodated the ball to the left before releasing an incredible shot to the second stick.
The shot crossed the entire area with a large elevation as it propelled towards the right cross of the goal.
The ball finally began the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in the middle of the jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
I just tried to get to that position to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as long as possible,” Sturridge comments on LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanté coming, I taped and I didn’t think much about it, I simply tried to kick.”
Chelsea won 1 to 0 after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, Blue's forward returned from heel to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost midfield and sprinting towards the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the midfield.
He then made a magnificent in-depth pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the controlled ball.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish off the second suit with a kick with his left leg where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League next Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play with the Videoton at the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths from Indonesia's tsunami reaches 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of the collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to the spokesperson of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the debris of the destroyed buildings.

Cromwell's statue of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion of "rewrite history"
Its disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction in the purest style of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by its fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordained by Cromwell.
Perhaps it would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor that he did during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century's view and part of the historiography of a figure that still many believe to be worthy of being commemorated.
Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a supporter of parliament against external pressure, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a subject of historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.”
A killer pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery and all covered with blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, as reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a court in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
As far as is known, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjoining pig court.
As he said, at court there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg piglet had killed the farmer, according to the report.
My cousin had his legs destroyed and full of blood," said the cousin, named "Wu", as mentioned in the news of Guiyang's evening.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned nor owned by Yuan nor his cousin.
One of the market leaders commented in the evening news that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to prevent anyone else from attacking, while the police gathered evidence on the crime scene.
As reported, Yuan's family and market managers are negotiating compensation for their death.
Despite being very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of almost 300 kg took a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to frighten the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "starter".
They like to play.
They are like children, they are very curious... they do not go with the idea of hurting.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout the southwestern USA
According to forecasts, the rose hurricane is weakening as it progresses over the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains all over northern Mexico and southwestern USA over the next few days.
The Rosa had 138 km/h winds, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 on Sunday morning, eastern U.S. time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving east towards the west coast of the US.When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity in the north direction towards the southwest of the US.
Rosa will leave on Monday up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Afterwards, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that approaches to generate torrential rains widespread throughout the southwest during the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste flows and the possibility of land landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
They are expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is the possibility that floods form, since the situation is worsening very quickly due to the scattering nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert on foot in the face of the tropical rain threat.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers, and storms can carry gusts of wind and clouds of dust at specific points.
The depression that is approaching will bring torrential rains at certain points on the coast of Southern California.
It is possible that total precipitation is recorded above 50 mm, which could cause minor waste flows and slippery paths.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Tropical rain showers will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
The torrential rains will spread to the region of the Four corners on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October there will be several major temperature oscillations throughout the US as the Arctic cools, although the tropics remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can occasionally cause drastic changes in temperature at a short distance.
The central US region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Nearly 20-degree temperature differences have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to start the month of October with heat in much of the central and eastern area of the USA, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts to the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures are recorded above the average in the east of the US during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million viewers saw Thursday the exciting testimony of the candidate to member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which was allegedly held in the 80s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday schedule due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by the Senator for Arizona Jeff Flake to carry out an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee for judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers have seen this testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not available immediately for other strings that broadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN, or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems calculating people who see it from their office.
Put into perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football playoff match or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the chain with the highest audience, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's data.
Interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while being incarcerated by protesters when trying to climb an elevator to go to a court view.
Flake stayed for several minutes with the shooting shot while resumed live on CNN.
Here you have me, in front of you," a woman said.
Do you think he is telling the truth in the country?
They told him 'you have power, while there are so many women who do not have it!'
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he commented that he will have more things to say in view of the committee.
Within a few hours, all the cable and broadcast chains were already broadcasting live the moment when the Committee on Judicial Affairs had to vote whether or not it was followed by Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate to submit it to voting.
Flake said, however, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominated for next week, a condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, as it was clear that the republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation for allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing to make politics” in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised their plans to leave the European Union of "playing to make politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and despising national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with May on May’s cover, May’s former foreign affairs minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Brexit Chequers Plan, where he asserts that the UK and EU mutually raise taxes is “all absurd”.

A volcano spit ash in Mexico City
The ash spitted by the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The national disaster prevention center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they were kept away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.

Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo”, has remained active since 1994.
The police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favor of independence clashed with the anti-riot police and thousands of people joined opposite manifestations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of pro-independence individuals retained by the anti-riot police began to throw them eggs and powder paint, causing the emergence of dark clouds of dust in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later on the same day, there were skirmishes with the police, who used their batons in order to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independentist groups sang “Don’t forget, we don’t forgive” face to face with unionist manifestos calling “Long life in Spain”.
Fourteen people had to be cared for by minor injuries suffered during protests, according to local sources.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of independentist mentality a year after a referendum considered illegal by Madrid was held on 1 October but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, given that those contrary to the secession mostly boycotted voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote by entering the polling stations throughout the region, which caused violent confrontations.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the pro-independence demonstration together with his wife, said that he no longer had much hope about the possibilities that Catalonia achieves independence.
Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are excited," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although by little, in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have suffered to keep the push this year, given that many of their main leaders are in a self-imposed exile or detained waiting to be judged by their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the police support demonstration with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been fuelled by the politicians on both sides.
Tension does nothing but increase,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
Presenting yourself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after gutting a house with a car

The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursdays at 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says that damage to the doors and the building itself was caused.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has shot a crossbow against the car.
A play by Menga gives the victory to Livingston for 1 to 0 against the Rangers
Dolly's first goal with Livingston was victory
Livingston, who had risen this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what was hardly the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Meng's play made the difference, as with this victory, Gary Holt's team go up to the second position, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's side, on the other hand, remain unbeaten at home in the Premiership this season; next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League.
Livingston expanded his unbeaten run to six games in the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what defeat has been since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in the direct play of visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead on the scoreboard long before the goal, since his direct game caused all sorts of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way between the defense, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the goal. Then, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out to try to finish off Craig Halkett's pass, which crossed the goal.
The locals were already happy to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could put visitors into problems in isolated plays.
And this is how this decisive goal came.
The referee whistled a foul against the interests of the Rangers and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and finish off from the central part of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated the possession, but encountered an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had little work throughout the match,
The stage was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop merit.
For his part, the goalkeeper of Rangers Allan McGregor stopped with his feet one occasion from Scott Pittman and Lithgow deviated another combination game from Livingston.
In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged Halkett ticket to Glenn Middleton's replacement, and the other for his hands. Both were dismissed.
Livingston “phenomenal”: analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks that they were excellent, and continue to exceed all expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and the staff have hardly changed since his return to the highest category, although much of the merit must be attributed to Holt because of the way the team has galvanized since his arrival.
There was a good group of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, after a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be aware of Menga throughout the game.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments exposed with Gerrard as a coach, they have definitely failed to maintain the level.
They did not know how to create occasions (only once they clearly overtake the local defense), and that the Rangers, who is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Sweet reception for Erdogan in Cologne
They were all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which aimed to repair the relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police claimed safety reasons to prevent a crowd of 25 000 people from congesting in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurdish, were also made heard while condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and labelled dictator by others.
Traffic accident of Deptford: A cyclist dies when he bumps into a car
A cyclist has been killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, an area with quite a lot of traffic in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although the paramedic services attended the cyclist, he died at the event.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist died in a case of leaking in Childers Street, 1.6 km from the place of the accident on Saturday.
The metropolitan police have said that their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest relatives.
The street has been cut off and deviations have been applied for the bus routes, in addition, the drivers who avoid the area have been advised.
Long Lartin Prison: six injured agents in an altercate
Six prison agents have been injured in an altercation in this high-security prison, according to the center's office.
The events occurred in Long Lartin's prison, Worcestershire, around 09:30 on Sunday, local time, and still persists.
Specialized tornado agents moved to the place of events to end the altercation, in which eight inmates have been involved.The riot has been held on the one hand.
The agents had to be cared for slight wounds in the face in the place of the facts.
According to a prison service spokesperson: “We have deployed specially trained prison staff to try to solve an incident produced in the Long Martin prison, which still lasts.
Six employees have had to be cared for with wounds.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, we are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be accountable to the police and may have to spend even more time in the pig.”
In Long Lartin's prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was known that the head of the prison had to be taken care of in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, anti-riot agents made presence in prison to solve a serious altercation in which center staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with major floods.
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen at the beginning of the week when what remains of the rose hurricane passes through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of floods.
The national weather service has already issued alerts for floods on Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the Rosa will arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and that the night of Monday is approaching with rain.
Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have kept the storm state or tropical depression within a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the Arizona border".
The most recent models of the national hurricane center provide for 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, could register from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas outside the risk of flooding, the Rosa rain could become very good news, given that the region suffers a severe drought.
Although floods are a serious cause of concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, since the southwest region currently suffers a drought.
According to the US drought control service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will touch the land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which causes it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to hit the ground in Mexico with tropical storm force on the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Precipitations in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of floods.
According to weather.com, “75 to 150 mm total rain are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm”.
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before reaching the border with Arizona early on Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah well into Tuesday night.
The main risk we expect from the Rosa or what remains of it is very strong precipitation in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern US desert”, according to the national hurricane center.
Rainfall is expected to cause hazardous floods and waste flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four detainees per attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy has been found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found with wounds in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 on Saturday, local time.
It was transferred to the hospital, where it is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call for anyone who may have some kind of recording of the facts with their mobile phone to get in touch.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “has suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection vote for the merciless and indignant tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump decreed in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "delivered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its process of appointment.
Kavanaugh stated before Congress on Thursday, strongly denying and encouraging Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of having sexually abused her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also stated in sight in relation to his claim.
The president said Saturday that, on that day, “the American people saw the genius, human quality and courage” of Kavanaugh.
The vote to ratify the judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable trajectory of service to the citizenship”, he commented to the crowd of sympathizers of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of Republican voters' participation rate in half-time elections.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but in reality I’m going there,” he said.
That’s why I go everywhere fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicating themselves to "resisting and clogging".
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place at the latest Friday, as reported to CNN by an attendee of the Republican Party leaders.
Hundreds of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by giant waves that clashed against the beaches, due to a serious earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as claimed by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday on the occasion of a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast towards the sunset, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
When the threat for tsunami came yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not run right away, that's why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed atop a tree running away from the tsunami and were able to survive, he comments.
About 16 700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency showing the number of shops and destroyed buildings, turned and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas continued shaking this coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series were heard in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the intense Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched over Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped among the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications “were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came” from Donggala, says Nugroho.
There live more than 300 000 people," commented the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
It is already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse,” he says.
The agency was heavily criticized Saturday for not informing of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said that the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a social media fan, you can feel like a man on the top floor of a building gives desperate screams of warning street people about the close tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water explodes on the seashore, taking buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in the power supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid in cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuated continue to need food desperately, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened for assistance only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuated centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths due to Indonesia's tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Donggala were able to reach the city of Palu, where employees shelter in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
They told me that they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It is a catastrophe.
Although the aid groups made the bleak gesture of starting aid tasks, some people complained that it was preventing humanitarian workers from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and the provision of personnel from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a catastrophe has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
It is still a disaster at provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "well, it is a national disaster", we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While the second night at Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the disappeared people kept the hope that miracles were produced and their loved ones would elude the devastating story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child trapped in a sewer was rescued.
On Sunday, rescue teams freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subando, the Indonesian national paraglider team coach, had trained two of the paragliders missing for the Asian Games, which concluded at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
As a senior paraglider, I have my own emotional burden," he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages by the WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
I think this means that the messages were not received,” he added.
A thieves take $26,750 during the filling of an ATM at Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by Newport Police Department.
The Dennis McCarthy agent told the communication that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM into the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man " came running behind Brank's employee" and stole a money bag for distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper is renamed Ye
rapper Kanye West is renamed Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
It has been a time since in the 41-year-old West, they motigo it with the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurs prior to its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, in which it is expected to present its new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think ye is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means you,” West said earlier this year, while talking about the title of his album with the radio presenter Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us.
I have gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confusing part, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers that have changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West contributor, has earned his nickname with or without a hyphen and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when there is little left for the country to fulfill the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "the military force would never be used again to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when student leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who is committed to supporting young Mexicans awarding monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
has stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted by criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds allocated to AI
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it devotes to research in this field,” says Kai-Fu Lee, investor and professional specialized in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the U.S. Government have announced AI measures, although in the country there is a general lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world's number 1 in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
Duplicate the budget allocated to AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of AI,” Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the opportunities that the U.S. will achieve the next great discovery in AI,” said Lee at the CNBC in an interview conducted this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
In 1980, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an AI system that surpassed Othello's American player with the highest ranking and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively assessed previous technological competitions by the U.S. Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Project Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the following would take place in order to identify future visionaries.
American researchers often have to work hard to get public grants,” said Lee.
According to Lee, "it is not China who takes academic leaders; they are companies".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university expertise to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the US task in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
I think permanent residency cards should be automatically offered to doctoral students on AI,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation of Natural Sciences and other public bodies in the U.S. give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China,” said Lee.
At the beginning of the year, the United States Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, designed to involve industrial and academic institutions' collaborators, and the White House announced the constitution of a Select Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month the DARPA has announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently allocates more than 100 million USD per year for AI research.
Meanwhile, it has been months since no measure has been applied in relation to American legislation that aims to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonians hold a referendum to decide if they change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed with Greece for decades, which had blocked requests for accession of Macedonia to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermined the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign makes him doubt if he will reach the minimum participation necessary of 50% so that the referendum is valid.
The question stated in the referendum ballot is: «Do you support membership of NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?»
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth to pay to achieve Macedonian membership, one of the countries that were created as a result of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, into agencies such as the EU and NATO.
«Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life», said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that it will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularity at 13 h.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to the 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” declared Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian prime minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would open the way of joining the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of Skopje's parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with the high head, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can resort to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of the Euro-Asiatic integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev claims that joining NATO will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before depositing his ballot.
Zaev stated that a “yes” would mean the “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another survey, led by the Macedonian chain Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% stated that he would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A referendum failure would be the first major blow to the Western government policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, scored a goal after haggling all the Brighton defenders
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling annulled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory went 2–0 in the game played at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He left for speed between three defenders of the Brighton, sweeping the path through the field.
Later, Agüero was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He haggled a defense before overcoming a few more on board the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that he found Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right leg beat the Brighton goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that sneaked into the net on the right side.
«Agüero has discomfort at the foot», reported Pep Guardiola, coach of the City, to journalists.
We have decided that it would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We are fortunate that he scored a goal at the time.”
Sterling gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in fighting for the Premier League.
His goal reached the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball in depth in the field of Brighton and
made a beautiful pass to the space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane led the ball before moving it to Sterling on the long pole.
The front of the Sky Blues topped the ball inside the net before getting off the bottom line.
The City faces on Tuesday at the Hofenheim in the group stage of the Champions League, at 18:55 h, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the fight for play-off, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, expects to get out on the pitcher's Sunday pitcher that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain an advantage match over Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have chances to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a wildcard with the 5–2 victory against Nationals on Friday night, but were still seeking their first division title.
Although we do not play anything, at least we can go out to launch knowing the atmosphere there, in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to miss this game?»
Nationals still have to announce an opener launcher for Sunday, but they are apparently determined to let Scherzer throw away if this situation occurs.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, gave a warm-up session on Thursday and would launch on Sunday, on his usual rest day.
The Washington right-handed launcher has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 disposals for strikes in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump makes a meeting in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republican participation in the mid-mandatory elections.
Everything we have done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I don’t introduce myself, but in reality I do introduce myself, that’s why I am everywhere fighting for fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: «You can see this horrible group of Democrats, is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all the necessary means, their meanness, their bad intention are seen.
They don’t care who do harm, over who they have to pass to gain power and control, that’s what they want: power and control, but we won’t give them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “resisting and clogging.”
And this can be seen in the last four days,” he rebuked, and called the Democrats ‘angious, mean, dirty, and false.’
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic Senator in the Senate Judicial Committee, which led to a strong public scrutiny.
Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Oh, eh, what?
No, eh, no. Wait a moment... That was a very bad expression of body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.”
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because it manifested itself with determination against antisemitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, these are similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party, it was reported that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Parliamentary, the General Committee meetings held on Friday night have been exactly that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and for a long time the promise of “generous and kinder” policies has been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged based on whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to take a 180o turn and take positions that he would never have adopted, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which an appeal is made so that my candidacy is not renewed, the center policies are reported and I am told that it should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who every day have to cope with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and do not get ripped.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with each motion of “non-trust” or each change in the rules of selection, the party tightens more.
In the last two years I have received many advices and have recommended that I keep my head low, that it was not so expressive and "everything would be fine".
But I did not enter the policy for this.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by the negligent government of Thatcher, who left my whole class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local advisor or as a government minister.
I have never hid my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt in any way about my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would tell them that at a time when the country walks towards Brexit that will harm homes, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not directed towards Nottingham Momentum, but towards my electors, whether or not I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of not renewing my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, for the benefit of the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr heads the lead
Two last minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant game on Tennant's Premiership day.
The Ayrs, who are the only team unbeaten of the ten, occupy the top position in the leaderboard.
In the end, the local team prevailed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and the trainer Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
The matches we played so far have put us to the test and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Congratulations to the Ayr, they have taken advantage of the occasions better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, converted by Frazier Clima, put ahead the Ayrs, but a yellow card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, loaned to the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted trial.
Clima expanded the advantage of the Ayrs with a penalty and, just at half time, scored and converted an essay to put the marker 17-5 in favor of the Ayrs to rest.
But the Melrose began well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Later, the party was interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired on the stretcher, and in the resumption the Ayrs re-enlarged the distance with a Stafford McDowall essay converted by Clima.
Then, the substitute captain Blair Macpherson was cautioned with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of another man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a beach in Clima without a ball, from the sanctioning alignment, MacPherson scored a counter-assay behind the ayr penetrating mole.
Clima scored, as he had done almost since the resumption, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball on the third line to Gregor Henry to score the fifth rehearsal by the local team.
Star Series Still Game star seems to be ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Star Game series, seems to be ready to move into the hospitality sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he has been writing and co-starring with Greg Hemphill, his long-time comedy partner.
The duo announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from The Scottish Sun newspaper noted that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flowering catering sector".
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without coast, expects the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol for their naval headquarters covered with arson in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a navy flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are filled with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia's coastal territory, the memory of a coast lost in the face of Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean again.
These expectations are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia expects the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, do not have to say it, waits for the result with a positive stance," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court of The Hague will dictate in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is required to negotiate the granting of a sovereign outflow to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes set out in Monday’s resolution.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Court decides in favor of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the result of possible conversations.
The resolution of the TIJ, which occurs only six months after the final allegations, indicates that the case "was not complicated", affirmed Paz Zárate, Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a decline in the last four years.
The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any gesture of goodwill by Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the Court was exceptionally rapid.
Next Monday Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea claims nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can rely on the US
U.S. Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho claims that his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday to the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to maintain the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it appears that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a chimera to think that the continuous sanctions and US objection to a statement that ends the Korean War can make North Korea ever kneel.
Washington distrusts accepting the statement if Pyongyang does not make important disarmament movements earlier.
Both Kim and the president. American Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang takes seriously the question of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of large hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look for any more.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been razed by very unpractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's featured piece was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing that flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of quirky masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, brightly colored, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a complete diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you follow the great fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The large hats tread on the heels of "The Bomb", a two-foot wide-winged hat, which everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so unpractical that it spread over social networks brought another great creation to the catwalk: a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed in a swimsuit that carried it.
The dark orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the collection La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags in the main streets next summer, considering that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is enhanced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, you will come to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will come to his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the grade A above.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students obtained an A rating in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons that employers gave them difficult to fill the vacancies, 17% were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
Since there are increasing potential job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted in 2013 by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and 15% of French speakers were the only double-digit language.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland there is diversity among schools with respect to the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on the more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that will be considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, around 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, you can always choose between a number of languages in independent schools, which have teaching staff specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of what the future will be.
In the global commercial environment of the present time, it is not possible to deny that languages still have a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron will debut with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
Waiting almost finished for fans who want to watch LeBron James play their first match with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes you will play.
They will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official site of the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, journalist of the Lakers, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After early this week's training, James was asked about his plans for the season six calendar of Lakers.
I don’t need pre-season matches in this phase of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaigning events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump rallies for the next week, including visits to sympathizing sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court is pending, Trump intends to get support for the next half term elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19h today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing started this week with the candidate nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained due to the accusations of sexual abuse he is facing, while the Senate's planned confirmation vote is waiting for up to a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of rallies is to help the republicans who present themselves in the delicate elections of November to collect momentum.
Therefore, the five rallies of President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans attempt to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
Congress control is as important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, while we are heading towards an busy season of campaign," said Trump's spokesman who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
That night's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is obtaining unfavourable results in the polls.
It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him impetus in the surveys," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: North American team shows off their ambition to keep alive their hopes for individual Sunday matches
After three unequal sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is a sport concept invented, in which players truly believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on what side is the positive dynamic now?
They had a six-point advantage and now it is four, so I think we are in a small positive streak,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely because of the state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is giving example.
The guttural screams of celebration rose sharply as he continued his lap and put a crucial putt to draw the fourth match, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar shout, of the kind he indicates that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
You have to make the most of yourself and worry about your own game,” said Spieth.
It's all that these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four of four and do not make mistakes.
Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way in which their energy seems to flow in and from the busy public, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who paired Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sank Spanish and Swedish into a hole that never had any option to leave.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you out of the hole.
The four-balls and foursomes are very fascinating to see by the interactions between the pairings, the tips they give and those they don’t, and the way a strategy can change suddenly.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reaches the Ryder Cup final with a favorable scoreboard of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a victory for 10 to 6 over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulties and leave their record, so far, in four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that was not successful in the four-balls of the morning and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the foursomes and won two matches, but could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points at the 12 individual matches on Sunday to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they drew a brilliant performance to beat a desinflate Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for a 5&4 even more emphatic.
Woods, who had dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-balls and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything on a nice and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set up a benchmark Saturday for Americans getting two points.
They achieved a 2–1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-balls and later re-won Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4–3 in foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team had picked up a four-point difference in individual matches, although the Furyk team, champion of the title, only need to draw to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack next Sunday is beyond your reach.
North Korea declares that it will not unilaterally disarm “in any way” if no signs of trust are appreciated
The U.S. Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the sanctions were intensifying his distrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World's General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing center, and committing itself not to proliferate weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we don’t look at any response in line with the US,” he said.
«Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.»
While Ri resumed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as you take measures gradually, its statements seemed significant because he did not reject full unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. acting president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised assurance of North Korea security.
North Korea has attempted to formally put an end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang has previously to eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The U.S. insists that first denuclearization must occur and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive way, in addition to opposing the "late declaration of war", said Ri.
The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continuous sanctions are intensifying our distrust.»
Ri did not refer to the plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this stagnation situation".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he held last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that pointing to the U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim of "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but stated that there is still much to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said that there was no deadline for this and that "it does not matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously promoted sanctions in North Korea since 2006 on a commitment to cutting off the funding of Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then reported that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but after a few hours North Korea accused him of making "a gangster's own demands".
At a meeting with Moon held this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and nuclear complex if the United States took "measures in concordance".
Kim told her that the "concentious measures" she was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised to Singapore, as well as actions toward the normalization of Washington relations.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of studying throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic observed that often university students number one in the world are upset by what goes to the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said: “Why do they tell me now, all this, in my last year?”
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he reported in The Telegraph newspaper.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are explained the basic concepts about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services at the University, said that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, on how sports performance affects lack of sleep, and on the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
We know that the behaviour of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know it, as one has the right to know the effects it has on health smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and the growing pressure that students suffer from make sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy good quality sleep for a long time should be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, added, even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, as he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to undertake a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they put an alarm when they go to sleep and wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga ends with the men of Gerrard
Dolly Meng's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's house that is another stumbled outside.
The Ibrox team sought to add their first home victory from the victory of February 4 to 1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to knock out their team, 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half-time, and never seemed to have the Rangers, lacking in inspiration, about to match the scoreboard.
While Rangers now falls in sixth place, Livingston climbs third position behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the judge of the Calum Spence line needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object apparently thrown from the tier.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that swept the Ayrs in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven headline that kicked off a point against the Hearts last week, probably feeling satisfied by the way in which his team, well organized, stifled his rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored two minutes away, when the first appearance of Menga left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder kicked off and missed the big occasion.
A forceful lack of Keaghan Jacobs ran into Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow only kicked off the post.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty on the fifteen-minute signal, as he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers led only two shots at goal in the first part, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problem with the head blow of Lassana Coulibaly and the docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livy the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only for their effort.
Again, the Rangers could not deal with Jacobs' worked play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who maintained the calm to choose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard paused to switch Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and the change had an almost immediate impact, as the end made a pass to Morelos, though the imposing Kelly ran to blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the visitors’ attention by playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band could have given direction to the final stages, but McGregor remained firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow kicked off from the corner.
The replacement for the Glenn Middleton Rangers still called for a last penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his eyes large.

And now a page of the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day on which the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally gave rise to the device we know as “Geiger Counter”.
Geiger, a science pillar since then, also became a pile of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, some apparently failed cowboy physicists:
Man: ‘What’s that diantre?’
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can listen to the effects of the atoms emanating from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure he's bursting now!"
Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and alter them in the laboratory
You can “see” a common protein in many cancers and then re-inject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various cancer types.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the disappearance of ovarian cancer that she suffered for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then to re-inject them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein “ favors the growth of various types of cancer”, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West engaged in a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after her performance in the SNL program.
It did not end well
Kanye West was shouted in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated him, and said he would run for the 2020 election.
After his third song at night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
Whenever I talk to white people they tell me: How can you like Trump if he is racist?
Well, if I’m worried about racism, I’d left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee for the allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, comedian Chris Rock raised the recording of West's disapproval on social media.
It was unclear if Rock intended to ridiculize West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated between frames due to the cap he wore.
They threatened me between frames.
They told me not to go out with that hat.
They besieged me.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while saying that you would put the Superman layer so they could not tell you what to do.
Try to love."
His comments caused the scribes of the public at least twice and the program team members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who had a reporter who explained in the post: "The entire studio was completely silent."
West took Ariana Grande’s last minute replacement, whose former rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left much of the audience perplexed with the performance of the song I Love It, disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU TO HIGHLIGHT BETWEEN MULTITUD."
But the debate presenter, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and who is absolutely wonderful."
But I chose not to reward someone (buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I think adopts and disseminates an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
And we too," he added.
Prior to the show, rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "the former being known as Kanye West".
It is not the first artist to change the name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, before it was called Snoop Lion and the late legend of the music Prince changed its name to a symbol and later to the artist previously known as Prince.
Accusation of tentative murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of tentative murder following the stabbing of a man on Friday in East Belfast.
According to the police, the incident has taken place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the court of first instance of Belfast Monday.
The prosecutor's office will review the charges.
The Star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of the swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the virile hero stereotype, claiming that these roles imply that young boys often believe they should be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times’ Culture magazine, Kit said he believed that “something went wrong” and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that being quite determined to face this problem.
Personally, I now wonder where we have mistaken ourselves in terms of masculinity,” she says.
“What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we experience now?”
According to Kit, television can have part of responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so virile characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they should have this facet of virility?
I think it is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because no doubt something has been done wrong with young children.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for next summer, saying that he is fed up with battles and horses.
As of November, Kit will star in a replacement of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best he has provided Game of Thrones.
I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life on the go,” she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the character’s love that represents Kit, Jon Snow, in the Emmy winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China notifies an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health agents.
Only 40,000 new cases were declared in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has been reduced almost to zero, according to the statements of Chinese health agents at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexually HIV transmission is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but the discrimination of the LGBT collective is common.
Considering the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who maintain homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of precautions appropriate to sexual relations.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked Senators data from the Republican Party and dismantles “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
The U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the accusations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three US Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that demands were driven by critical and far-right websites.
Lies, lies, and more appreciable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information contains the addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by someone unknown in the Capitol during a session of the Senate Commission on allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was related to Waters' office and revealing information from Waters staff, reported the Capitol.
This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure lie," Waters continued.
The member of my staff, the identity, personal data and the security of which they have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this information leak.
This unfounded complaint is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of White House's former press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
This denial is full of outrage," Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that he does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It should not be shown challenging.
You do not have to question the motives of the accuser.
It has to keep calm and serenity."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's criticism of the Democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to overthrow Waters in the mid-legislator elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
Important if true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
We will make sure that criminals are revealed, continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions they have carried out and that they have harmed each and every one of the members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review: Rowan Atkinson’s Limited Spy Parody
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this replacement of Johnny English's parody of action-comedy, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous autosati about how are we despicable will be a new export opportunity of the country?
In any case, the incompetent of outgoing eyes and face of rubber Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to twist everything, his name indicates more than anything else that it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Closeau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy that brings a single note to the theme of Carros of fire to the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on international and mysterious traveler Atkinson who represented the now forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good times on this last JE journey.
I loved Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the leaves of the helical ringed in the helmet.
Atkinson is seen in the gift of physical comedy, but humor seems rather loose and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems intended for children rather than adults and, for me, Johnny English’s absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the mute gags of the character Mr. Bean representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British supersecret web spies network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the consternation of the service agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resource for a Prime Minister that is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character calcified by Teresa-May, but the script does not reach more.
Their intelligence advisors inform you that, as each active spy gets endangered, they will have to recover some retirement.
And this includes the clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in a luxury institution, but teaching unofficial classes on how to become an undercover agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his skater, Bough, a role that once again represents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of when things get very ugly in the secret service of His Majesty come into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular “femme fatale” Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: disguised as waiters, they blaze a French fast food restaurant, sow chaos by smuggling on the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes great confusion when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarise themselves with the interior of the Volta house.
All the stops have certainly been removed from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, everything seems a children’s program.
Quite normal things.
As with the other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role to do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the leaders of the companies to pass the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the workers giving them one more day of partying.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the economic agenda of the party and the plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The shift to a working week of four days is supported by the Trades Union Congress confederation as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party stated in The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint manner.
According to a Labour Party spokesperson: “A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it.”
The Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's conference to detail his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculative" to public service companies.
The plans of the minister in the shade also imply that the shareholders of the water companies may not recover the entire investment, since the Labour government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers at the boards of companies and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to pack annual dividends for a value of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains in "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's research at the FBI could make them change their minds.
FBI investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question about whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican Senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, the correspondent for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that made them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
I talk seriously," said Kennedy.
In the session I said I spoke to the judge Kavanaugh.
I called her when everything happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked her if she had done so.
It was firm, determined and safe."
However, Graham's vote seems to be shot.
I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and would present an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that: Brett denied it outright," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people who name him will be able to verify it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive program of stars, which carry out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global objective of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help actively combat it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless someone wants to pay a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a number of tasks or "shares", such as volunteering, send an email to a world leader, make a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What achievements has Global Citizen achieved now that he has 12 years left to reach his goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case of what we call “clictivism” (people who think that makes a difference by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "shares" of its supporters, who have helped to achieve various goals.
It declares that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and comparable policies to more than 37,000 million USD, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from their shares, of which at least 10,000 million USD have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that at the moment the protected funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the major commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based investor and filmmaker association that is committed to "helping children grow as much as possible" and promises to send Rwanda 35 million USD to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a page footer of history," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions that asked the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs of your website asking you "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen replied, "It will be a long and hard path, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great movements of defense of civil rights and against previous apartheid, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "lock" to hinder Russian energy exports (Inland Secretary)
Washington may, "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting the markets, including Middle East, has revealed U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, citing Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly, where it operates with an invitation from the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said supposedly.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to address this issue.
The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to block, to prevent their energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are indeed the same.
The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, while indicating that Russia only has one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, officers of the Trump administration, including the U.S. President Donald Trump, attempt to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 "unsuitable" pipeline project, which according to Trump, turned Berlin into "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which cost 11,000 million USD and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110,000 million cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the opinion that I'energy cannot be a tool to press and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, declared Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization in the German sector, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has appealed the US to turn off EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said she will “considerably” her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she would “consider her candidacy for the presidency after the mid-legislation elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the fracture of the government, for women to hold senior posts," said The Hill.
After November 6, I will take my candidacy to President seriously.”
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and stated that he "was leading the country in the wrong direction".
I am really concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "It is clear that an FBI investigation is necessary before the elections".
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed they should not be filed for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters have said that the senator should not be presented, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed broader support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high profile names among Democrats who took into account a possible candidacy for 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator for Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially disclose his decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes the affected by TEPT Track Palin in Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on 11 September 2007
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
With what my own son is going through since he returned, I can understand other families who suffer TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds with which our soldiers return," he explained to the public in a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "they return a little different, they become hardened, they wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence to a woman, with a declaration of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and DC support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district presented an amicus curiae on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the demand for the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented the month of August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said that his partner "and the children of the violent gang member" attacked her, but U.S. officials refused their asylum application on 20 July.
They arrested her in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The Columbia District Attorney General, Karl Racine, stated on Friday that the new policy " ignores decades of state, federal, and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum demands to be allocated according to the facts and particular circumstances of demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy denying the entry of immigrants harms the US economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
Asylum is available to those who leave their country by persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement on 11 June of this policy.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts at Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
The atmosphere is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while reassuring her son with a fever in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Lack of drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed houses to catch flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside of Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated out due to the heavy shocks that are repeated.
The tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he met his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, and added that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
I felt my wife crying for help and then I didn’t feel it anymore.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're fine."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of harassment with "propaganda ads".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper promoting mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed last Wednesday to China Daily's payment supplement at The Des Moines Register, Iowa State's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of impossing itself in elections to the U.S. Congress of November 6, accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to break into the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to lay down pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently disrupted in a trade war that intensifies and has seen tariffs increase in mutual imports.
China’s vengeful tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and companies in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: “It’s redoubled harassment with advertising advertising for propaganda in our free press.”
By divulging its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the beloved American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to insert a paid advertisement into The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
On the other hand, in the newsstand there is street down here in Beijing, you will find few disparate voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer of publishing" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans leave voters from women before the mid-legislator elections with the disaster of Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Since many of the major Republicans support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who faces various demands for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the next half-legislator elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone", explained Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last-minute pressures of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to carry out an FBI investigation will be sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, main advisor and national spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants called "November is coming!" (November is coming) while they manifested themselves in the Senate lobby while Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be left out of the chart,” explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
People say they have already been tall; it's true.
But they could have been more so, especially among voters of women in suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote while they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, where he detailed his demands for sexual assault on the candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if the Republicans pressed with the confirmation.
This has become a mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee president at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
It is not just the vote of the board or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the accused's bank, but it also has to do with how the republicans have managed this issue and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, on the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford’s wake and Kavanaugh’s witnesses, with the balance that leans slightly towards the last.
A new YouGov poll shows 41 percent of respondents undoubtedly or likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe undoubtedly or likely Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or undoubted during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same of Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the demands filed by Ford and, at least, by another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the influence of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez denounces that the candidate for the Supreme Court taught her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was "to dominate the world".
We have to do it now," said the start-up.
It's a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive to the personal online data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some developers on a contracted workforce to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google on whether it is necessary to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely emptied during the night.
We are not asking for permission."
In a Saturday publication at the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the “mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on grid neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the I GM Victoria Cross cleric
The only church clergyman in England who won a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverent Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative tombstone in a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after the award-winning feat of his grandfather.
According to The London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage" he pushed the line forward before launching a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
The Lieutenant Colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were a feat that he could never match, which gives you a feeling of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by support that many people will receive.
The fans of the MMA who stayed overnight to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead of her
Imagine that you stay awake all night to see Bellator 206 and that they deny you see the most important event.
The San José poster contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and had to be watched live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for confrontation, the UK spectators were stunned when the lineup changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted by having spent the night awake until dawn to see the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the change by cartoons as "a kind of vomiting joke".
The government's regulation says that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to the children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's marketing and communication vice president, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa the little pig, yes."
The President of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
I think that when I think about repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
But there are six in the morning of a Sunday and we will not be able to solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at your.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when I changed channel, there were many messages that went and came, and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a government problem.
I promise you that it will not happen again.
We will leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it back to the followers, but it ended.
It is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “bottom” about sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown to feel less than the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
24-year-old sportsman has stated that he did not realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs program, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she talked about gay rights to give other people “hope”.
He also said that being a father had been important to win the Olympic Games.
The usual presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of sick leave.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway in Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" the others because "it was not socially acceptable to children".
He said the following: “Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
I wanted to prove that it was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when they ended up discovering their sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used its image this year the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” to other people.
The trichamp of the world explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American director, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "I was caught by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 greater than him, but he says that the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you are young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley; according to Daley, "his entire perspective" has changed.
If you had asked me last year, everything I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said just like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had the London 2012 tickets, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn’t tell him “father, you won’t be there to occupy the first row,” he said.
While holding his hand, he stopped breathing and was not until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won the bronze.
I knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: to jump in front of a crowd at home in some Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Poud de Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which still put his goose bumps on him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worsening Mickelson appeared at the Ryder Cup Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson beat a record Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his physical condition if he does not want to become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to beat a record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments splits his time between acting as an animator and working in his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the drivers more direct, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal choice for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough usually punishes the blows deviated.
And if his own career is not quite daunting, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, will face the precise champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the Tommy Fleetwood rookie to win the four games this week.
If Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual matches, start strong, the Mickelson match could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more about it.
He perfectly understood his role that day, he made me a palmade on my back and surrounded me with my arm while telling me that I would be prepared the next day," said Furyk.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams previously and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like any other."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mean the end of a race in the Ryder Cup that has not matched your individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
It's fun, sarcastic, joker, likes to mock people and is a great companion for the team," he explained.
I think younger players also had fun getting into it this week, which was fun to see.
It brings much more apart from its game”.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can fade soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they achieved victory for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
“You still remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for little”, Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score in 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members who have not yet finished.
Tomorrow you have to go to all machine.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This does not end until the points do not go up to the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we must maintain concentration to do so.
I have already said it, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have in mind who are our rivals: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of its players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: “I will never rush with that.
Tomorrow it will be different.
Tomorrow individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It’s great to be there with a buddy when everything goes well, but individual duels test your ability to play golf to the fullest.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At that moment, you leave your partner and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.”
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than in a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the comebacks of the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before losing in the "Miracle of Medina" that won Europe.
I remember exactly all the words,” he answered to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, was motivated by his players before the last day.
Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start on the right foot, as seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and in the best way to try to make magic tomorrow”.
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of Europeans in the first half of the order.
I chose this order because I think it covers all possibilities,” Bjorn says about his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not, at least, until next year as a result of defective systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but after construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-buck missiles, as well as technology against poaching, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that cutting-edge ships, which were expected to project to Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already reported last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details of the reasons for which it was returned are known, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it useless if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, since approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonn “Rheinland-Pfalz” will weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached some amazing 3,100 million euros (3,600 million dollars) from an initial budget of 2,200 million euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, if the recent warnings are taken into account that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used".
The officer stated that the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were no longer used, but no new ships were provided as spare.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation is spying on the secret lives of bats
A new investigation carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
It is expected that discoveries can provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Scotland Foundation will continue to have soprano and common bats, as well as bats with northern and water ears in the Botanical Garden of Inverewe, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track the activities of the bats during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed image at the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor at the Scottish National Foundation, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as well as the role of mamosques and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than the eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated location technique to locate insects and obstacles that stand in their flight.
The Scottish National Foundation, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has ten experts with the right training, who carry out surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues regularly.
Even the organization has created the first and only Scotland reserve dedicated to bats on the Three Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bat.
The administrator of the estate, David Thompson, claims to be the ideal territory for the species.
Here at Threave, we have a large area for bats,” he says.
We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still do not know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking if there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks on properties, since it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and illegal to kill, attack, disturb and destroy nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish bat conservation officer, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said the following: “We still have to learn a lot from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we do not have enough data about their population.”
Ronaldo denies accusations of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the accusations of violation against him are “false news” and has stated that people “want to become famous” thanks to their name.
His lawyers will demand the weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the accusations.
The striker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of violating an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 at the time for the incident not to be made public, according to the information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video targeting his 142 million followers hours after accusations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "false news".
No, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball on camera.
They want to become famous thanks to my name.
It is normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it is part of my work.
I am a happy man and everything is in order,” added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for accusations, which have qualified as "inadmissible information of suspicions about private life", in accordance with Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek to obtain compensation for "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most blatant infractions of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Las Vegas hotel and casino Palms.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped it annually, according to reports filed in the Clark County District, Nevada.
Mayorga states that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him that he was a “99% good boy”, except a “1%”.
The documents argue that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but were consented.
Mayorga also states that he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries to the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courts because he had "fear of retaliation" and worried him "to be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she seeks to annul the agreement, since she is still traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from the Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he signed for the Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom “always regrets” of losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “will always regret it”, if it lost the state of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was “worse” that Toyota’s base in the UK has stated to the BBC that, if the UK left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
We need an agreement,” said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of border delays in case of an unagreed Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis Toyota models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
My point of view is that if the UK leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota management director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with other EU countries will work has aroused the fears of other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW states that it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is made on a “just in time” basis, with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching any agreement on 29 March, there may be disruptions to the border, which the sector considers could generate delays and shortages of garments.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day on the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a consequence.
Clark states that Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future EU relations is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
We have to reach an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
Tests not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains”.
Toyota could not confirm how long production would stop, but, in the long term, warned that added costs would reduce plant competitiveness and could cause job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union on the floor, said that members begin to be very worried about the situation: “By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never return”.
A government spokesman said: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU”.
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
Donald Trump's long-awaited meeting with deputy solicitor general Rod Rosenstein could be "possibly one week" while continuing the struggle over the nominee to the supreme court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements of the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, links between Russia and Trump's aid and possible obstruction to justice by the president.
Whether Trump fired the Deputy General Attorney or not and risked Mueller's independence, he has fuelled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record the conversations with Trump and also the possibility of depose the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump has stated that "I would prefer not" to say goodbye to Rosenstein, but he postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate's court audience to which they testified Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may take a further week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we will see it. I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists could refute this statement: Sanders has not taken any White House briefings since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he did not like the fanfare of television journalists, although he said: "I will not deny that they are fanfare".
He then hinted that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President gives more sessions of questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any source: "We have consulted these data".
Sanders has stated that informative sessions will continue to take place, but “If the press has the possibility of asking the President directly from the United States, it’s much infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you have seen us do it a lot in recent weeks and they will replace the information sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States”.
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at times, strange before the journalists gathered.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service for fears of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter within six months of the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of applications for state of residence for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems directed towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in case of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know they are convulsive time for all of you.
Therefore, I wanted to reiterate now that I really appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineline of the Tennessee State Tigers has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a saturday head injury by 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, of the Tennessee.
The manager of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, has announced in the press that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
He came to the band line and fell there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing it on a stretcher and taking it with them for further testing.
A Tennessee State officer has reported Chris Harris, from WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, who Abercrombie had left the operating theatre at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or scope of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after signing for it from Illinois.
He had completed five beaches on Saturday before leaving the match, which made a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of the Corbyn movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the tax will be taxed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Finance expects to get up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people.
It is expected that foreign buyers will be taxed a higher bell tax when buying a property in the UK and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises of providing more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The rise in the tax timbre will be recorded in those people and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be allocated to the action of the government to combat the figures of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Finance expects to obtain up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's newly built properties are residents who are not British, which increases prices and makes it difficult for novice buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many well-off areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “phantom cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the large constructs of keeping property prices high by buying ground quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain’s “real estate disaster.”
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on the rent and completion of evictions “no fault”.
It also wants to give more power to municipalities to build new homes.
May stated: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for each new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be correct to be as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to British inhabitants who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home in property is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes everything even more real.”
Jack Ross: “My greatest ambition is to train Scotland”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "highest ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots have accepted the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast, which currently ranks third in the League One, at three points of the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They summoned me once as a support and that’s all,” said Ross to BBC Scotland’s Sportssound program.
But I grew up watching Scotland play Hampden with my father when I was a child and it is always something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed by training in clubs, but”.
Ross's predecessors in Sunderland's coaching position include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former coach claims that he does not feel the pressure to be the next in a list of names enshrined in such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be if I can return this team to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is the Premier League,” he said.
It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I’ve been successful here if I can bring back the club.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching team.
He helped Alloa avoid falling to the third category and transformed St Mirren to fight for salvation champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross states that he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Probably it was a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the position in Alloa.
I had always thought that training was what was best for me, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I left reasonably and enjoyed good moments.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you have to overcome every week.
I still have a good time in aspects such as stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the time I’ve felt more comfortable since I’m an adult.”

The perfect time for a comb are 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has triggered consumption in bars with difficulties in Britain, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and chains of bars have obtained an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has been reduced by 4.8%, as indicated by the statistics.
Peter Martin, from the financial consultancy firm CGA, the company that has collected the data, states the following: “The continuous hours of sunshine and the participation of England in the World Cup, which has been extended more than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by drinks consumption, have obtained the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman, from leisure and hospitality analysts RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors related to the sales of the external leisure market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8% year-on-year decrease in sales would be particularly harmful, rather than the continued pressure on costs.
This long and hot summer could not have arrived at a worse time for the shops that serve food and the weather will tell if the most moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide that necessary respite”.
The total increase in the sales of bars and restaurants, including recent ones, has been 2.7% in July, a data indicating the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The sales indicator of The Coffer Peach Tracker for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the sector's established benchmark.
One in five children have social media secret accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, have social media secret accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in the “false of Insta” pages
News have made fears about sexual content publishing grow
20% of students say they have a “main” account that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in the “false Insta” accounts, a reference on Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has made fears about the publication of sexual content grow.
20% of students say they have a clean “main” account that shows their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a message from a teenager in which she urged others to “violate me”.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Private Schools (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years have two profiles, half of whom have admitted that they have private accounts.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “speakers” in the Scottish athletics federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish athletics federation directive at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field and field athlete with the most medals in Scotland and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide sport to benefit from his extensive experience internationally in the last decade.
Eilidh has respect for the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope to grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland.”
The U.S., which won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, among four Olympic golds and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote the following on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
The doctors told me that only the time will tell me if I can recover or to what degree.
It has been exhausting, but I have fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and today it is time to do agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages!”
An announcement of pulls that compare mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A pull-out company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the “first silent pull that can be worn in the world”, the technology company for the consumer Elvie has issued an announcement inspired by a musical prank video to show the freedom that the new puller gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of fodder and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I am milking myself, but you will not see any tail" and "If you have not noticed it, they are not braguers, but my breasts".
The return continues: “Bump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, milk the girls”.
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused Internet controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixture of reactions from those who have seen it, of which many say it shows the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth," a person wrote.
Elvie tie is discreetly hidden in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented on the following: “Understandably traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a ticker for mothers who will keep their babies?”
Another user added: “It’s an off-site advertisement”.
Other people defended the announcement; a woman admitted that finding the song was "fun".
I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the tirall made me feel exactly as if it were a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but you should take it like it is.
It’s a great product,” a user wrote.
Another person commented: “It is a funny advertisement intended for mothers who pump with pullers (usually in their workplace or sink and feel like they are cows.
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, women show that they have all danced with the strap discreetly on the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like they were cows when they use the cypress.
However, the Elvie tyre is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, which gives women more freedom to move, hold babies, and even leave while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s first childhood partner and developer, said: “Elvie tirallet is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
By drawing the parallels between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a puppet is used and the challenges that suppose to do it, at the same time that we showed, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new puppet.
It is not the first time that the Elvie tyre is released on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children silently moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of emigrants withheld children has increased even though the monthly entries across the border have practically remained stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country if they decided to take in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking officer in the customs and immigration service, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to host unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
About 80% of the people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people,” said Albence.
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to be brought to court within a month after being held, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, in accordance with workers in the shelter.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of in person, to defend their case to obtain the legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for aid, will be deported immediately.
The longer children spend in custody, the more likely they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent rappels or escape attempts, according to the workers and the reports that the system has made known in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be caused in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to their size, the signs that a child is suffering are overlooked.
They added that moving children to camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or saying goodbye to friends can cause them trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges the “employment forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country having lasted for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “the matter will be treated accordingly”.
They must be removed immediately and unconditionally,” he said in the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the “war of terror has practically ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He has stated that Damascus would continue “fighting this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1000 troops on the ground of a country hit by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed “some western countries” for spreading “irrational fears” that make refugees want to stay away.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last great rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has remarked that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and has expressed the hope that military action will face jihadists, who include Al-Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan of Mistura, sent from the UN, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to begin shaping a post-war constitution and preparing the path to elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, scandals and the process of removal end their presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be “the end of a more dramatic presidency of history”.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of spectators at maximum time have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and practically tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at maximum time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show”, from MSNBC, has led the audiences of cable television with up to 3.5 million viewers on the main information nights.
People have been thrown into it because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?” he asked.
He replied that because it made him laugh,” Scovell told me.
There is an entertainment point in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the Washington script might determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families will be able to meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And even so, being an informed citizen is going further when you are at the sixth time to see a group of experts discussing the use Bob Woodward has made of “for private use” sources for his book “Fear”, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich jacket (“a piece of thick clothing like his pride”, titled Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let’s say, Trump’s anatomy.
In my case, I will not see Super Mario again.
Part of what makes it appear to be part of a TV show is that every night you get something new,” says Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the character changes and script twists of the Trump program (fighting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss any episode because you're left behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and I was alone outside the house that has on the north coast of Kauai, but it was closed looking at the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
It could not be detached, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
I remember when we did those crazy programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
I thought it would be a kind of joke, but it seems they were right.”

External money floods the run of the half-legislator elections in the tighter House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a cash flood in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the re-alignment of the congressional districts that two current members have to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignment of Pittsburgh's suburban district involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won the place in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who clashes with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the old districts were divided unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for itself in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a very followed special election in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held the post for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won in the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States impose sanctions on the Salvador for his support in China, but they withdraw them
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with President of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked off the Trump Organization management team.
Officers of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to the Saviour, the Dominican Republic and Panama for the “recent decisions on the fact of ceasing to recognize Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the department, this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received aid from the United States in 2017 of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic improvements, was contemplated.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on issued visas, would be harmful to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths from murder and unemployment.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent emigrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officers of the administration clarified that they wanted the meeting to occur, which effectively ended with any probability of sanction for the Savior.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, scheduled now for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration gives, according to diplomats.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to their posts in the Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions by Washington.
A spokesman of Bolton's White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, which include two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations from anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymity, corroborated his statements.
Study history
The next event to take place could be the special tax report Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there are numerous evidence in public records.
In what is known, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump might find himself giving accounts to the body, just as he prepares to do so before voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or of any of its European names, is inevitable.
There are decisions that should be taken on both shores of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted it and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed later.
The course of history fluctuates over turning points like this one and accelerates or delays the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing several turning points.
What will happen if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been with water in the neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he secretly suggested registering the president and speculated that it was not suitable for office.
Rosenstein states that the Times information is not accurate.
How will we respond if the FBI's new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will make Trump responsible for it?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will start to run safely.
But I think we will not fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the house of the ambassador.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With this background, how should I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers received the Vienna Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw in the Villarreal field this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the group of G of the Europa League.
An injury to the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the match 2-2 against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard to get great results.
It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
We played the party believing that we could get a valuable result and we left it with a point.
Perhaps we could have taken something more at the end, but, in general, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it is another great European night.
We hope to be able to stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they took a good result in the last match, but I am sure that we will give everything and we will achieve a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it is a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the trainings are good.
I hope we can give it all, leave behind last season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep by fear of savings for retirement
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to the family.
Approximately half of the respondents at national level say they have spoken to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents say they spoke to their children.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not dare to consider it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationwide.
You have to start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to receive attention, since these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your expenses or own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money needed to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the step to legal battles.
Find a representative to be able to designate a trusted person who supervises your medical care and ensures that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can not communicate.
It also considers the possibility of contracting a notarial empowerment for your finances.
It is advisable to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid in the event of disability.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your old family member has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Specifies these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also with which doctors it wants to be," said Martin.
What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan prepared."

The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when they shot him in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers have described the shooting, which occurred around 2.30 a.m. (during the British summer schedule), as a "random act".
The victim has not seen his attacker.
His life is not dangerous to wounds and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Since communications are cut, the aid units have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu closest to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important information about Palu and Donggala, in the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of Central Celebes Province's economy, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The mining of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast at the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in western Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific firebelt and earthquakes occur frequently.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years are listed below:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which at Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island on the Sumatran coast.
2006: A magnitude earthquake 6.8 hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook an area pop of the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai, on the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A soft earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the earthquake and deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died due to the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested with charges for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and candidate for Vice-Presidency Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, born in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspected of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence and arrest resistance report, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled the phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su provisional detention center, where he is held with an obligation without a warranty of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, surely" when asked how he declared himself, according to this chain.
Palin faces three class A fouls, which means he could go to jail for up to one year and have to pay a fine of up to 250,000 USD.
You are also charged with a lack of class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that criminal charges are registered against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaskan veterans court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon intoxication in relation to the incident.
His partner stated that he had punched his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating their child's violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from their service to Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian Island of Celebs Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks do not work and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake has occurred just off Central Celebes coast, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social networks videos circulate with the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of New York terrorist attack
New York federal prosecutors call for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to conduct an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway, on the Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists during its journey, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused serious personal wounds, in accordance with the notice of intent to sue the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with an accusation letter with 22 fouls that included eight accusations of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of mafia, plus a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required considerable "planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last time that the southern district of New York brought to trial a case of death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, native of Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that they stated to the researchers that they felt good about what they had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be deployed in his hospital room.
He has declared himself not guilty of the accusation of 22 fouls.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the accusation.
We consider that the decision to claim the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a perpetual chain without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," said Patton.
The Saipov defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party states that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the conservative party conference.
The former UKIP leader has stated that politicians should "feel the pressure of eurosceptics" when one of the members of the Theresa May parliament itself has suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said on the departure of Birmingham that the UK would already be outside the EU if Mr. Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces when reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when conservatives in favor of the union have presented themselves in another Brexit protest in La City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to preserve his Chequers engagement plan among attacks by Brexit supporters, Union and EU supporters.
The Allies insist that it will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure the Eurosceptic and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the rally Leave Means Leave de Solihull that he wanted to undo Chequers' engagement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and should have given him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in office, we would be out," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must undo Chequers's commitment".
To pinpoint his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed their mindset and wants to stay is totally false".
Brexit's conservative supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said before the reporters: "I'm just telling him, Prime Minister, to listen to people".
Chequers's commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it will be unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the streets and get us to win an election.
Abandon the commitment of Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that the politicians of the rally should feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class," he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not allow them."
In a message to the excited crowd, he added: "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure".
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before celebrating a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small number of activists stirred banners over the conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus deal, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It is a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of becoming a candidate for the presidency
The U.S. Senator, Elizabeth Warren, says she will examine the possibility of becoming a candidate for President after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about its future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presented for his re-election in November against the representative of the state of the GOP Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
It has been a speculation center on the possibility of relieving Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with members of the open meeting format since Trump assumed his role.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that does not work, and this includes a woman on the dome."
A person arrested for death shot by Sims, from the LSU
Baton Rouge's police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect for the death of the basketball player LSU Wayde Sims on Friday was arrested.
Baton Rouge's police department has announced 20-year arrest for Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET press conference.
They published a video of the shooting Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man from the footage.
Sims, 20 years old, received a shot and died near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
Wayde Sims was shot on his head and eventually killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul commented on Saturday in the media for 247sports.
Wayde attempted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and having fired Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and took him to custody in the police department of East Baton district.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 starts in the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the title of the world after the team's orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel stepped into boxes before and left Hamilton to run with the traffic on the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at boxes and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel action that caused the Ferrari rider to abandon the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap was in seventh place on his 21st birthday.
Then he continued in good position much of the race, as he kept his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen and move to the fourth position.
Finally, he entered the boxes at lap number 44, but could not increase the pace in the next eight laps and Raikkonen was placed in fourth position.
It is a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and it was a real lord to whom they told me to let it happen.
The team has done a great job to have one-two" Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein on a Saturday rally to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in accusing the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly of Ford's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are "bad, cruel and liar".
Something that could happen and the most beautiful of what is happening in the Senate in recent days, when you see anger, when you see angry, bad, cruel and liar people," she said.
When you look at communications and leaks and say “No, I haven’t been me.
I haven't been me".
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... Did you filter the document? "Oh, what?
No, no.
I did not filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we did not filter it," he added while imitating the Senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I did not hide the statements of Dr. Ford, I did not filter his story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to be confidential and kept it confidential, as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented on the Saturday night rally: "You know what! His body language was terrible.
Maybe he did not, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of inadequate sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purpose.
They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see wickedness, cruelty, no matter who hurts, whom they have to run over to have power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's defeat at the Elite vs. Belfast Giants, as they won the 5–3 return match at Dundee Saturday.
The Giants quickly got a two-goal advantage thanks to shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee, then two goals from Lukas Lundval Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who came to win the Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came in the hands of Dwyer in the fourth minute, 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assist, and four minutes later, with David Rutherford's attendance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan put the home team back into the game at minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the equalizer to minute 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants in the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time at the end of the second half and guaranteed his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake plane
An air controller from Indonesia has become a hero after dying to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a large earthquake shaken the island of Celebes on Friday and unleashed a tsunami.
Many replicas are taking place in the area and there are many people trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, while his comrades escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the quirky control tower of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that the flight Batik 6321, which was on the track at that time, could take the flight safely.
Then, he left the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
An Air Navigation representative, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
This has broken our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has announced that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying help and groceries.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minimarkets have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross works against the clock to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline that operated a flight that will crash into a Pacific lagoon in the Micronesia now says that a man has disappeared, although they previously said that the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they did not find a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find it.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities reported on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane soaked in the lagoon because the track was short for him.
Some witnesses think the plane was overlooked.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
This was extremely positive," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he himself and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants were panicked and began to scream, and that he suffered a slight wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who were working nearby to improve a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a timeline for the night that a woman was burned alive
The prosecution is concluded on the Saturday case in the review of a man's trial accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described the jury as using the records of the mobile phone to build the movements of the defendant, aged 29, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that your mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis said the truth when he claimed he was in the van of Sanford that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his van was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Telephone records indicated that only a week ago they were known.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
He erased her from her life," said Hale.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would pass into the hands of the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of gender.
Bristol's High Breed claims that hip hop has departed from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put the conscious hip-hop back into fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY babysitter demands a couple for dismissal after a "racist" message
A New York babysitter has denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother where she protested because she was "another black person."
The couple denies they are racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed consternation by seeing that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
NOOOOOOOOOO ONE OTHER BLACK PERSON", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her phyxia, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that the nanny she had fired, who was African American, had done her job wrong and that she expected a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the payment for her workday and then sent her home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims compensation for the dismissal and calls for a compensation of approximately 350 USD per day for the six-month residency for which they had been hired, although there was no contract.
I want to show them that things cannot be done like this," he explained in the Post Friday, "I know that it is discrimination."
The couple responded to the statements that they are racist while stating that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid of not being able to trust her after she was offended.
My wife sent him something I didn't mean.
He is not racist.
We are not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco, in the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand with an "extortion", said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
Are you going to chase something like this?
It's not a very friendly attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and their logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers did not identify themselves with a talking bone, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: "It is difficult to put herself in the place of someone who reads her for the first time before her publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before having the inspiration for writing the children's book on a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the rejection of the book, as well as saying that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "sweet", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and adds that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous," he said.
But because Paddington was so real for him, it was practically like when your child gets something: you pride yourself, even if it's not your thing.
I think he considered the success of Paddington like this.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always used to recognize Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
On landing, they brought their daughter fast to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked on her to save her life.
Nad frequently called to say that it was very serious and that they did not expect to overcome it" said Mrs. Ednan-Laperousue.
Then I called Nad and told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that she had to say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said to him, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
Soon I will go with you.
I will go with you.
The drugs they had given him for his body to continue beating were being consumed and were leaving his system.
He had died before what was planned and so everything was turned off.
I just had to sit down and wait, as I knew what was happening.
I could not scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and more people.
I had to keep good shapes."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience that was happening.
No one knew it," he said.
He had a cot head and tears did not stop falling.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her a lot."
Mourning women hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers to which citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
I don't want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs Davis, residing in Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room."
However, he abandoned his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after his own life had been taken off.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am continually concerned that there is a collateral effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people who can go, who can listen, even if it is a friend.
Do not stay silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, his companion for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
He never said that he was not well depressed or anything like it," he said.
A couple of days before Christmas we observed a change of attitude.
He played in depth on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and he did not look at them in the eyes or anything."
He said that his death would be a big trauma for them, but they have to work on it: "Opens a hole in the family.
We are destroyed.
But we have to continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is held by a thread while the FBI initiates research
I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was destroyed with the rooting deadlock of supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
If, as expected, the Republicans do not obtain good results, they will be weakened when it comes to getting the man they want to be elected to reach the main court in the country.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, as well as meeting his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, undo the tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea "falls" with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification said 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in prices charged by people traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Typically, the vast majority of deserters in the North are offered South Korea nationality.
Seoul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape across China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, rather than refugees, and would often repatriate them by force.
The relations between North and South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work to achieve a nuclear-powered free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign affairs minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and is unfit to work in the High Court
The minority leader of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber said that the candidate for the High Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and that his temperament incapacitates him to work in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival to be held in Austin, Texas.
I can't help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have told her that she is a "hysterical", Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied accusations of having sexually abused Christine Blasey Ford's doctor when both were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and running out of words while talking about his family and his years at high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said that the accusations against him meant a "grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not work on the High Court, as he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if confirmed, and if the Democrats achieve the majority in the House of Representatives.
This is what I can say: if he does not say the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only able to be in the High Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the Court of Appeal for the Columbia District Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation audiences, he avoided questions about whether he would cancel certain decisions of the High Court.
It is no time for a hysterical person and with prejudices to enter the Court and wait for us to look wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and can not take it away without crying.
We cry when we get angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's uncommon. And you?"
She continued... "It helped me a lot a woman who was an executive somewhere she told me she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and began to cry, tell the person she was talking to: "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
It seemed brilliant to me."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for rage in part because, basically, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a male majority, where once I ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a greater woman (a cold directive that had always terrorized me a little) who caught me from the neck and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
Never let them see you crying," he said to me.
They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they will rejoice because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic MP of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought that there was no reason to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
It was not a well thought-out decision,” he told me while he was laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said "Blancaneus and the Seven Dwarfs"
As he arrived late in the campaign, he was lagging behind the fundraising, promising that he would not enter the race if he did not raise 2 million USD.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave 1,000 USD to men were only willing to give 250 to her.
Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for targeting voters, instead of delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she was left speechless.
It could have been thought that she had a nervous crisis" recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press.
It could have been thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
He cried"?"
How the trade war between the US and China can benefit Beijing
The initial salves of the trade war between the U.S. and China were deafening and, although the war does not seem to have to end soon, a distancing can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed on major exports from China, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth 200,000 million USD.These tariffs represent a tax imposed on half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Peking has counter-attacked every time in the same way and has recently raised tariffs of five to ten percent for 60,000 million USD of American goods.
China is committed to replicating the US and the second-largest economy in the world is unlikely to be backwards soon.
Making Washington back entails ceding to some demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that initiate a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had planned," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "prepared" to bring refugees back, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are improving.
Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress that has been made in combat against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime is grateful for any help to re-build the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional help or help from the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has achieved the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team won the crown again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points necessary to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the blow to the water at the par 3 16 hole, which yielded the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his series and became one of the four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was removed with a 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European national team Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The most skilled player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the greatest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 points of race.
I’m not crying, but today I can’t help it.
It was a very tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing and believing in me.
I am so happy, so happy to have recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... And I'm happy to have been able to help," commented an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes over to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of the American Gulf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual Sunday competition.
I am incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost the four games he had in France and now has a career record in the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players that have existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought the whole weekend to look for the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought.
This morning there has been a time when we have pressed the European team.
We have fought.
I take my hat off by Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Your 12 players have played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and am proud to have been your captain.
There are some to take off the hat.
They have defeated us."
