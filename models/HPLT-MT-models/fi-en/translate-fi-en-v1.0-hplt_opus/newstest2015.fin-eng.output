The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the joint on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the joint last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipal merger, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue on its own.
Kuopio and Juankoski will decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is approximately 111 000.

India is also said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian forces shoot civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the Kiev leadership of refusing direct political discussions with the separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to engage in an essential political dialogue with the eastern part of its country, Putin said, according to Itar-Tassi.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, who Kiev and the West say are aided by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current positions, where Putin said Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The aim of the militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get the chance to shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmire workshop.
It surprised me that the group arrived early in the evening.
There were visitors for two days as expected, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be hip-hop festivals, i.e. there will be no pop, Kangas assures.
In Finland, a law enters into force on Tuesday that restricts the purchase of suitable substances for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must apply to the National Police Board for permission to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a source of explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, for example, but concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used in acceleration, for example.
However, precursors acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Premier League: Super Raheem shines - Mario is overshadowed - Premier League - Evening Messages
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered to be the hope of the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, strengthened by Mario Balotelli, came to Tottenham as a guest.
Super Mario’s first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from his peak.
Italy lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of its sixteen assists to its own team.
Pool supporters who have already preferred the player expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli for the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The star of the team sparkled instead of Balotell at the midfield diamond tip of Raheem Sterling, which stuck a 3-0 win over the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, does not shine just with its power.
The English, 20 cent shorter than Baltell, is between the opposing lines than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who at best thanks to a speed of about 34 km/h on the grass.
Rodgers also deserves a great deal of praise for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman explained how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player than the outskirts of a northwesterly Londoner who grew up at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra since autumn 2016.
The newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, have asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she will start her new position with joy and pride.

The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation," he says.

The Pihtipudas.
Women Volley, a Finnish women's volleyball league team from Rovaniemi, failed in the final of the Vampilan Athletes in Pihtipudas training tournament on Sunday.
The Vampula won five stretchy matches for a 3-2 win.
WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbour was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defence game and the passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVon coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's spruce was thorny in that the 190-centimetre American Sentence Jenniferched had her back stuck on the side.
Sara Niemi played as the center.

The company announced its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion will continue.
Lidl also reported that during the last financial year, almost EUR 14 million of taxes were paid in Finland.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4 200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often killed in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video to pay tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
The researchers reviewed more than 1100 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, more than five years after the diagnosis.
Susan Jordan from the QiMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers went through women’s health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, past diseases and socio-economic status also affected survival.
In older women, and with cancer more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was the lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not investigate why women living outside cities are less likely to cope with ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and more difficult access to treatment as possible causes.
Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their reception is mostly in large cities,” Jordan says.
Although remote treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distance decreases, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programs to support patients who are far away from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, the survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor, regardless of geographical location, which highlights the need for better care and better cancer prevention programs.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old family mother living in Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the parking space in Friendship Park, next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
The City Board decided on Monday that the proposal for a town plan for Friendship Park and its surrounding area will be made publicly available at the service point Osviitta.
Opinions on the plan proposal are requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland ELY Centre.
With the change in the town plan, the city wants to enable tourism-related snowmobiling activities to continue in the area.
The site is intended to form a park area that includes the area between the current Friendship Park and the river.
According to the proposal, from 15 November to 30 April, a maximum of 200 m2 of snow mobiles will be permanently available.
Refueling points may also be placed in a certain part of the area.
Service traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area to safari companies for hiking in winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and the contract is valid until spring 2018.
Snowmobile parking and the change in the plan has raised even loud opposition.
The residents of the neighbouring apartment buildings have been annoyed by both the noise and the concerns about emissions.
However, the emissions in the area have been studied and no observations above the guide values have been presented in the studies.
The renewed fleet is also lower than the old one.
The Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point was moved further away, the hotel’s safari customers should be transported to the departure points of the safaris by buses estimated to have 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and surrounding area of the Friendship Park is also wide enough for sleds, better than the places presented as replacement starting points, such as the boat pier on the east side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The friendship park is good for its location, even because the activities can expand in the Ounaspavilion, for example.
The consolidation of the parking business is part of the city strategy approved by the City Council of Rovaniemi, according to which the city aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business by reserving enough high-quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre’s master plan, which has not yet gained legal force.
Landings of owner-occupied dwellings are visible in garden stores
The decrease in the number of homeowners, especially in the group of under 35-year-olds, could lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions, as today’s young consumers reach the “main target group” for garden sales in their age,” the Financial Times reported from a study by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) in the UK.
According to the Financial Times report, only 55 per cent of the money spent by homeowners is spent by homeowners on gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in very urban apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases as the front yard is increasingly paved for parking. These factors also threaten the horticultural sector, which has an estimated value of around £5 billion per year.
In the London metropolitan area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, with the lowest amount of money spent per household on horticultural products across the country.
However, according to HTA and the British Horticultural Association (RHS), an increase in the rental of housing or a reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS’s senior garden advisor, says that “for example, plants grown in portable farming containers are particularly popular among homeowners, as such growing containers can be included in the change if necessary.”
According to the HTA report, the years 1997–2005 were a booming season for garden resale, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the end of the 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, as the weather in March and April last year was worse.
Turkey interrogates US diplomat for espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to provide a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US Embassy Secretary and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey has been the main spy on US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all the major states have been spying on each other.
A previous report of the German intelligence service's espionage in Ankara triggered a more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze in new Finnish film

Majorca Magaluf Chief of Police accused of corruption
The case revealed evidence of blackmail by police officers and officials of the Calvià City Board at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvià, on the holiday island of Mallorca, has been arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by the business and bar owners of the Magaluf district.
José Antonio Navarro was placed in pre-trial detention after several business owners on Punta Ballena put charges of corruption against him. The majority of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located on Punta Ballena.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the case revealed evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the Calvià City Council at the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca against Corruption on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
Throughout the country, the daily newspaper ABC wrote about the indignity of the owners of nightclubs about the bias of the authorities, which made their business significantly more difficult.
It’s no longer money, it’s survival,” one business owner said to the court.
You will not destroy our trade.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in the headlines of magazines this summer when a YouTube video was posted online, where an 18-year-old British holidaymaker had oral sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to curb the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in notorious, alcohol-flavored pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub where the oral sex video was filmed was ordered to be closed for a year, and a fine of EUR 55 000 was imposed on the owner of the nightclub and the organizer of the pub crawl, Carnage.
Above all, among young British tourists, the popular tourist destination of Magaluf has also become a recommendation for the so-called balconing trend, which has caused a number of accidents caused by alcohol consumption, when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, as rockets and rocket launchers bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and the schools remained closed as the area recovered from the battles.
The opening of the schools caused joy and excitement in the rocket-bombed communities of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the town of Ashdod in the south, in the Pashosh kindergarten, workers removed fragments of traces from the walls and slid before the children arrived after the rocket hit the kindergarten.
We are a little afraid, but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a Kibbutz, an Israeli community called Saad, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area need routines.
Bart’s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks that coming back to school after a long time feels “a bit strange”.
Sometimes we have had difficult times when we didn’t leave home,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Strip are suspicious of the return to the Palestinian grenade after killing a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited the school in Sderot, near the Gaza border, a city under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that “children’s education and safety will be taken care of”.
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire in force for the time being last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas’ demand to lift the Israeli-Egypt blockade and reopen the air and sea routes of Gaza.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected in Egypt later this month.
According to estimates by Palestine and the UN, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, according to which at least half of the deaths were soldiers, although it had no solid evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians were killed on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4 591 rockets and grenades at Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5 000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to shelter in more than 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still sheltered and as the fighting continued, school officials moved the beginning of the school the previous week.
I hope the school opens soon and we get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, 13-year-old, who lives in a school in Gaza.
According to the commonly used indicator, house prices have risen most in seven years in Australia during the winter months.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings, measured by the prices of Australian capital’s dwellings, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, according to RP’s data on Monday.
As a result of the increase, prices rose by 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as much as in the 12 months before August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, Research Director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of price increases.
RP Data results show that housing prices rose by 16.1% in Sydney and 11.7% in Melbourne the year before.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the next busiest; the average increase in prices is five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4% per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, spring in Australia will increase the number of apartments for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
Given the rise in the sales of the homes being auctioned, the generally high pace of sales and the continued low interest rates, it is likely that housing prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record audiences to Mänttä this summer.
By the end of August, more than 70 000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has featured classic pop art works by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
Mänttä’s art weeks, on Monday, reported that they had made a visitor record, when 14 500 people had visited the event this summer.
These figures are not used to.
People have been cut off from doors and windows," says Pauli Sivonen, Director of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums this year will be close to 100 thousand.
In previous years, there have been around 40 000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in mid-Tampere and Jyväskylä, has approximately 11 000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen points out that new museums are always open to phenomena.
The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art period will continue well beyond the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened in the Art Museum.
The police are investigating four thefts made in the last few days in Kajaani.
On Sunday evening, a broken window broke into a commercial property on Pohjolankatu.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from the truck’s tank on Syväojankatu.
On the other hand, a boat with outboard engines had been taken from the boat harbour in Petäjännikka between Sunday and Monday.
The rowing boat was white on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside, the text "OIVA" was read on the front.
A couple of suspects have already been caught by the police.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property was broken into at Tikkapurontie.
A police dog got a mark and a man in his twenties was found hiding under a fir tree in the forest.
On Monday, the police took another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same burglary.
Lost amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaani
The disappearance of a batch of amphetamines of less than ten grams brought a murder charge against a man in Kajaani, born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his common-law spouse and another man, and shot the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old woman from Kajaani, who had been suspected of taking drugs with a shotgun.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man involved was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a passenger car in which a party was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the pieces of clothing burned, a cut-off shotgun was found in the car.
The District Court of Kainuu will issue a judgment on the case later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
The statistics of the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature in the whole summer was recorded in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a seven-year-old Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy’s Rare Records, a comedy show based partly on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap at an upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy many times since his mother's death, and he ponders a lot about his relationship with his father.
It was very difficult to read the father.
His face was never seen, only a voice said, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Go on!
Now I look at cricket.
My parents, my brother Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father to discuss, for example, the shape of a beer pint or the beauty of a cricket shot.
I never talked to him about such things.
For the most part of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley and thus gained an idea of what his father's life must have been like, even though the working conditions are better today than at the time.
The smelters are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths, where flames, smoke and soot burst and bring to mind the grave.
The father used to go to the bath and just lay in the tub, and slowly began to sing to himself while washing the dirt from the smelting plant away from himself.
As I was walking around the melting pot, I understood that he had been working for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood was lacking in the proximity offered by his parents.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It was only when my mother began to get sick a little before she died that we began to repeat to each other that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through his own child he has been able to share the love he lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat “I love you” all the time?
Stop humming now!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn with French.
Why would we not be friends?
She is a great mother
Henry is still a good friend of French with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why would Dawn and I not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the death of the mother.
When I started to suffer from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to do a complete reversal.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
Nobody enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may describe his change during his career.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in making theatre.
Next up were the comedy of mistakes and August Wilson's Fences ("Fences").
The making of the theatre offers a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has been doing throughout his busy career.
Henry started as a factory worker when he was only 16 years old.
A bartender noticed him on stage doing imitations and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's television career began in the mid-70s. "For quite a long time, I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned how to work.
I had to grow up in the spotlight, I had to learn how to make jokes from the conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while living in stardom and being on television.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people performed in black make-up, so Henry ended up as a comedian for five years.
My family did not like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and reprehensible, I was able to work on huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
Yet, “the British TV award-winning, multi-faceted favourite and light entertainment programme” was at the same time a grotesque parody of black people.
Henry worked in the 80s in the second comedy series, which both spoiled and admired the black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
The next decade Henry spent on commercials, documentaries, TV shows and film parts, but after his 2008 LennyHenry.tv show on the BBC, he said to himself: “What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you’re just pedalling in your seat or going on a siding.”
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series “What’s So Great About...?”.
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught to us properly at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class who wears tights and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare issue raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: “Try it.
Do not abandon the whole idea until you know what you are talking about.
Meet the words and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the document and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost seemed as if a part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
This is what it is all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verses, do some background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play months before it was done.
The play was ultimately a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but it did not quite happen.
Shortly after that, Henry played the lead role in the comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I played in the British National Theatre, and I could not quite believe it.
At one point I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
A little voice in my mind said to me, ‘You have to do it alone for 10 minutes until the computer is working again.’
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the presentation would be resumed as soon as the problem has been resolved.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me would sigh of relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
You are part of the play, stay in your role
Henry "Fences" in the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines to play “Fences” was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods: “This is what you have to do.”
This is what Henry says, of course, with a FLOW voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: little humorous chicks interrupt our conversation all the time as he changes from one imitation to another.
Abstention from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as it seems dangerous to receive immediate thanks from an unknown audience.
If you constantly thirst for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but in general it no longer inspires me in the same way as before.
I ask Henry if he is going to go on a new stand-up tour.
It gives me real pleasure to sit together with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don’t think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like to play –
It's really fun.
The story is constantly being told, and I enjoy doing it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya prepares a register of officials to remove ‘ghost workers’
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove “ghost workers” from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks should no longer be paid, the Government’s announcement was announced.
The government suspects that thousands will still be paid after leaving office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to eradicate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit carried out earlier this year, a minimum of $1 million was spent on ‘ghost workers’ salaries and other financial abuses per month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid into the account even after a person has died or left office, according to BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri report from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must register themselves in the identification centres in the coming weeks to ensure that their data is stored in biometric registration format, a government bulletin was issued.
According to the press release, all those who do not do so without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as it will determine how many people actually work in their duties, and will also clean up pay lists at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of ‘ghost workers’,” says Anne Waiguru, a senior official in the Cabinet responsible for decentralisation and planning.
The result for the 2015 financial year in Seinäjoki could be a deficit of EUR 25.5 million, unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is expected to be around 9.4 million shortfalls.
Possible ways to improve efficiency were to reduce the scope and level of services, purchase of services, sales and subsidies of assets, and increase tax and fee revenue.
The size of the EUR 10 million qualifying target for investments is 8.5 million.
There will be no relief to the situation in the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenue, rising unemployment and a 5% cut in central government transfers will further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The City Board agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned into a strategic goal, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board also returned the proposals made to the Executive Board for preparation.
The proposals of the City Board will form the basis for the preparation of the budget at the Council’s economic seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the delegation seminar, the budget proposal proceeds through the committee process to the City Board and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of ‘conspiracy’ against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of ‘anti-government plots’, local media sources say.
The police authorities did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were in contact with corruption investigations last December, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large crime scene and monitoring telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at the time) said the police were part of the actions of Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This is a traditionally significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is a leading teacher at Slavianski School, where the daughter of Yatsenyuk visited, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return and that children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally embroidered children's shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas's Perry claims that the defamatory tweet was unlicensed
On Sunday night, a defamatory picture of a Democratic district lawyer was sent from the confirmed Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry when he heard accusations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed and followed by a new tweet in which Perry vowed that he had nothing to do with the image.
The tweet was sent illegally from my account.
I don’t agree with the tweet and I’ve deleted it,” a later post said.
Perry's background forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the picture.
The first tweet contained a defamatory cartoon of Travis district lawyer Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked the funding of the Lehmberg office when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month while Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of the tweet was: “I don’t always drive drunk, with three times the number of perks allowed... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing my finger.”
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg office did not conduct a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antion, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry said he was innocent and called the accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge to reject the allegations and said that the law under which the longest-serving governor of Texas is accused is unclear when mirrored against the constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state aid to a government inviolability unit operating in the district of Travis and handling public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-wing follow-up group to make a formal complaint.
Perry’s verified Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously as well.
After finishing fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the draw by posting a picture of himself jogging on the lake with the text “Here we come, South Carolina!” on Twitter.
According to Berkeley, the housing market is “normal” again.
One of London’s main developers has warned that the housing market in South East England has “returned” to the normal level of activity.
The capital of London's housing market has been plagued by huge demand and steep price increases while fearing a widespread credit bubble, which prompted the Bank of England to impose restrictions on housing loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, co-founder and chairman of the high-quality developer Berkeley, said on Monday that “since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the volume of trades have returned to normal after the 2013 peak” and added that this has enabled a “stable environment”.
The London housing market went well during the recession as foreign investors flocked to the capital.
According to data from the Land Register, the prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5% only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
Average sales prices of private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about one-fifth the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423 000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's real estate less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also been affected by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "manor tax" before the general election in May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that a April mortgage report with more stringent lending regulations would lead to a lower level of market growth both in terms of real estate sales volume and prices in the second half of the year.
The Bank of England’s recent data showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast for London real estate prices by three per cent, according to which the index for homeowners’ opinions on prices has already begun to decline.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen by a quarter from a year ago, according to real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased its revenue from sold properties to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that “the demand for a well-designed, right product in the best locations has remained stable and therefore sales have remained buoyant”.
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3 742 new homes in the year before April, almost one third more than at the peak of the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax gains rose by 40% year-on-year, up by £380 million and net sales by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s earnings for the year were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is £450 million.
In the afternoon, the Berkeley stock sold on the London Stock Exchange at a steady price of £23.96.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures online
Jennifer Lawrence will attend the 85th annual Academy Awards.
The hacker who claims to have a hundred other star photos leaked from Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence to the web.
A representative of the Hunger Games star confirmed that the images are authentic and condemned the hacker for “insolent violation of privacy”.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will receive allegations.
The images, which were originally released on the 4chan image release page, apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple’s iCloud storage system. The list of 100 other stars being hacked is claimed to be dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
It is not known how much of the images are genuine, although Scott Pilgrim v World star Winstead condemned the hack on Twitter.
For those who look at photos taken by me and my husband in privacy years ago: I hope you have a good mood,” Winstead said.
However, Nickolodeon’s “iCarly” and “Victorious” series, Victoria Justice, denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that “these so-called naked pictures of me are falsified, you don’t understand”.
Let me put an end to this from the outset.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
We only have an excerpt of Howard Jacobson's acclaimed novel of love and the letter j
They dissolved, it described the best thing that happened, gradually falling apart like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did she hear from the woman that she was too serious, laborious, intense, detachment, and perhaps also a little prickly.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the thorn.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The most recent victim of his thorns had been in the early days a relationship that had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have brought some content into his life.
Ailinn Solomons had unleavened hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a joyous heart, from a village in the north that was even more barren and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older travel companion, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house in a humid but paradisiacal valley, and the name of the valley was suitable for the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, the snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, the garden grew weeds resembling giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Reported by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” was nominated for the Booker Prize in 2014.
Nominations will be published next week
Kevern had been sitting hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to the receiver, through whom the whole country heard reassuring music and reassuring news, when the crosses of Ailinn, sun tanned legs, reminded him of a song that had long since been sung by a black performer and had often been heard by his father in the hut's blinds down.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played in the stadium.
They were not forbidden – nothing was actually forbidden – they were just no longer played.
They wanted to be forgotten, just like the word itself.
Public opinion brought about what the laws and the proclamation had not achieved: just as in the literary field people chose to read the memories, cooking books and romances of heroes, in terms of music, they prefer ballads.
After a day of fascination, Kevern began to key in an imaginary piano and sing a serenady to Ailinn's big legs in a boldly comic voice.
Ailinn did not understand.
It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller,” Kevern told him, and naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter “j” ran away from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father said he played the same game with his own father.
If you let go of the word beginning with j and did not remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It was not a very fun game back then, and it wasn’t that game now either.
He knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of it.
Jazz hadn't been banned either, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was room for only one word in life.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The wit had happened in the same way.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit of music.
Although Kevern had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, he had become familiar with jazz music through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn’t have to tell Ailinni that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn's age, it was likely that he did not remember a time when the most popular singers were not black.
No laws or coercion were needed here either.
Obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted with gratitude – grateful that they were as if they had been saved by the trade of happiness – the principle that each group did natural things for it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with African Caribbean ancestry are best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian continent, they were naturally talented with electrical appliances, so it was up to them to ensure that every family had a working phone that was used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When what happened, if it happened, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being blamed for the flaring of the flames and fearing that those flames would reach them next, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning the water pipe, and continued their lives with their eyes set on the ground and depressed by boredom.
Let everyone act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was hard for him to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could never have been put on as music.
Love was expressed through music.
They are not really offensive,” said Kevern.
Except, perhaps, in the opinion of the big-footed.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
No word would pass through the soundproofing of giant cabbage leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why did your father love something like this?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn’t want to lift two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was strange now.
It was funny for my father,” he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
There is nothing more to see in the whole world than Ailinni’s huge, crow-black hair.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
If you say so," he said, but did not sound convinced.
However, it does not explain why you sing it to me.
Ailinn seemed to be genuinely confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your legs are not really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said “I love you” but it was too early for it.
I think you’re charming because of your thick ankles,” he tried to fix the situation.
I am perverse in that sense.
This did not help.
He had wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which to control the cruelty of jokes.
Perhaps his father was supposed to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from his terrace chair, pouring out the saucer and spilling the wine they had just drunk.
The wine was made only of elderflowers, so he could not use it as a cause of collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like palm leaves in a storm.
And your thick head is what perversely attracts me to you,” he said.
Except that I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for his own, unnecessary, cruel words, and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment when Ailinn decided to oppose him.
Did Ailinn think he would hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in the brisk northern archipelago, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure it had basically been like life here too.
The same huge sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even paler and more devilish than their smuggler and dispersed parents, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat any woman who would dare to resist or bully them.
Thick head?
He would still see a thick fist if he were not careful!
Suction first – the kiss had become the most common word describing the sexual encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out of the receiver – suction first and then attack.
Kevern thought that it was too much too much, because already the sucking itself was dangerous.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but he was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed her, just as her travel companion watched her go up the window, the man who was the cause of her heavy life.
Adam leaves the garden, he thought.
He felt sorry for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
The man who turned his back, the bowed, the shameful, the beaten man from whom all the will to fight had disappeared – why did he feel so familiar with that sight, even though he did not remember seeing such a sight before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the newly described event, the intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the Public Opinion Private Institution in Ofnow, conducted a short study on the continuation of minor and moderate violence in those areas of the country where the reduction, or even the end, of violence was most likely taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
Much has already been accomplished, and much has yet to be done,” he wrote, “in order to level out the natural aggression of a people who fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite the church towers over the hedges, human gentleness has been rarely known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it creates.
The people weep among the sentimental ballads, devour the stories of overcome adversity and swear by the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time, the cruelty of old keeps in its relentless grip both rural communities and urban cohabiting areas, and there is also evidence of a new, more evil-souled will to argue in homes, workplaces, streets and even playgrounds.
You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize,” his director commented after reading the full report.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down on the ground.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
I don’t think I need to answer that,” said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to invoke his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again silence.
I don’t ask,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I am against atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
There are no prejudices at this workplace.
We are the servants of an open-minded society.
Although a certain kind of hypersensitivity is completely acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the Church – and what you call cruelty or evil-soul, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
Howling about what happened if it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, if it happened at all, will destroy the fundamental vitality of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, a flamingo pink LED light declared a pattern that Ofnow had been distributing to the country for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smil to your neighbour, value your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the sung word is better than written, but nothing beats love.
I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when he was sure that his director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that initially led to what happened if it happened.
This time, however, we will not shed our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
You’re going too far,” he said, “determining what our grandparents may or may not have done as ‘errors’.
You also go too far in saying that they shed their ‘hate and distrust on others’.
A person like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we are not talking about ‘us’ or ‘them’.
There was no ‘us’ or ‘other’.
It was a time of chaos, that is all we know about it.
If we are quite honest, in that chaos,” Esme dared to continue, “no group in society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk more about it – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to disburse accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is some way to do them.
But for what purpose does the past exist if we do not learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
I'm going through your report," he said, saying that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as he went to work, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by the passers-by as “evil and furious”.
Chances happen.
Lesotho army denies planning attack; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied having staged an attack on the government and said they were acting against a police officer who was suspected of attempting to engage in armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state travels with his family to a neighbouring country of South Africa after telling him that he has been threatened with death.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, a representative of the army, denied the attack and said that the army was thus responding to a threat from "political fanatics". The police have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
Lesotho's armed forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems," he told Voice of America.
Chairman of the South African government, Clayson Monyela, said the military's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
Although no one has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, Lesotho's military activities seem to be in every way consistent with the characteristics of a revolutionary enterprise," he said.
According to the officials of the Lesotho army, the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes that he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements between the large coalition government.
He thus denies that he has undermined the power of the government, although otherwise claimed.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft establishes a data centre in Uusimaa
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data center in Uusimaa, where the company refuses to specify its location.
In a communication from Microsoft to the media, the company states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
Previously, Oulu or Kajaani had been chosen as the location of the centre in public.
Microsoft will completely shut down its Oulu office, which will take up the job for about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors says to STT that the company is not commenting on the number of staff employed by the new data center.
On Monday, Kauppalehti reported on the establishment of a data centre in Uusimaa.

Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video under water, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules to follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, still make sure that the camera battery and other parts are sealed waterproof.
In addition, set camera shooting settings to match the images or video you want to take.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and camcorders have a setting to optimize the shooting conditions under water.
In addition – before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of 5 feet, while others can withstand a depth of up to 50-60 feet.
Discover both conventional and waterproof models in our purchasing guide and in our digital camera reviews.
Take multiple pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD screen that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is hard to see under water, and the composition of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows for forking, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface while shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This also gives you more colors in your photos; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you see.
Try to get close to the subject.
This is important advice when filming on land, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the subject so that the subject fills the entire picture up to the frames.
China does not allow Hong Kong to elect its leaders – protesters swear by retaliation
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters would not be allowed to elect candidates in the 2017 elections, despite the growing need for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business quarter after activists have begun to plan and implement protests only hours after the decision was published.
In practice, the decision of the People's Congress of China gives the Communists the power to eliminate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
This was to be expected, but it’s still infuriating,” says Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are working with an autocratic government.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People's Congress, defended the Chinese government, saying that the general nomination of Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised residents that it would be able to choose its own leaders from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough, as it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the nomination committee, which is managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be accepted.
In the summer preceding the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to block the business district if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was made, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of the main Hong Kong government buildings.
In the demonstration, the organisers announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and that they would create waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not disclose the details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their online press release, organisers said that the movement “will consider the Occupy Central rapture as a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way”.
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance for dialogue has been broken and that the city centre will be taken over.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the government’s main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, restlessness is fuelled by the feeling that residents are slowly losing power over their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has led to competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong’s life – the business world.
The protest they are talking about can lead to great financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it will take,” says Legislature Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
There are also stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong democracy activists are the hegemony of the Western powers that are fuelling the revolution.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region.
U.S. prom tradition hits UK universities: new students on private jets
We are excited to meet the demand for a first-class British travel mode for today's students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport, such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or the McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a safety aspect to the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their possessions across the country in their fully loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today’s students as easy and high-quality transportation to the university as possible.
According to the company’s representative, no reservations have yet been received because the service has only just been set up, but added that “students will start placing orders in the next few weeks”.
The company believes there is a demand for the service, although most students pay £9 000 tuition fees.
Today’s students are very different in terms of their expectations and aspirations than they were 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago when they started their studies. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the way to do it.
However, the National Student Organization criticizes a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the higher education section of the organisation, “this service plan seems to be very far from the life of the majority of students.”
Many of this month’s studies begin to be shocked by the level of living costs, when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has fallen behind the tremendous rise in basic living costs. Only then can we start thinking about where to find thousands to use for as simple a matter as arriving on campus.
Ipswich’s “pig house” for sale
Real estate agents removed the sales image of a house for sale in Suffolk after discovering that a big pig is lying in the living room of the house.
A one-bedroom house with a price of £120 000 is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The notification included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned on the couch.
According to the real estate agent Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
However, the image ended up in the notification by accident and has since been removed,” the company representative says.
In the announcement, Connells describes a former meeting house as a “unique one-bedroom house”.
Even though the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in advertisements.
The sale of the house has attracted interest in social media, where questions have been asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
The departure of Spanish attacker Fernando Torres from Chelsea was confirmed, but the replacement entered almost with the same door opening.
Chelsea announced that she had signed a four-year contract with the French club Loic Remy for QPR.
According to the press, the purchase price is EUR 13 million.
Torres, 30, moves to AC Milan with a two-year loan agreement.
He moved to Chelsea from Liverpool for a record £50 million four years ago, but never met expectations.
The Japanese player Shinji Kagawa's failed trip to Manchester United came to his decision.
Kagawa is expected to return to Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga, where he made his breakthrough before his transfer to ManU.
According to press reports, the purchase price is approximately EUR 8 million.
Kagawa's new contract is four years.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the Premier League.
Now I am happy to be a man from Dortmund again.
This is a great team and a wonderful environment, Kagawa said.
The second Bundesliga club in Berlin, Hertha, is strengthened by Salomon Kalou.
The Côte d'Ivoire national team moves to Hertha from Lille, France, with an estimated transfer amount of approximately EUR 3 million.
Before Lille, Kalou, 29, played 2006-12 in Chelsea.

The explosion occurred early on Sunday and was so intense that it shook the buildings within a radius of more than 100 meters.
Our whole house moved: we trembled with fear.
The explosion was so strong that our ears were ringing," said Maryline Yyvon, who lives next to the scene of the accident.
Already on Sunday, emergency accommodation was set up for the residents of the building.

Bulgarian prison staff hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria protested in front of the Sofia Ministry of Justice.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted to reinstate the old working regulations that were recently amended.
The salary increases will also be discussed with Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
For a month now, prison officials have been protesting symbolically against new working hours, saying they want to go back to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite the meeting between representatives of the prison workers’ organisation and the Ministry of Justice, there was no agreement on this matter, says Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are under way," Director General Rosen Zhelyazkov told BNR.
Members of the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protest of the prison workers’ organisation.
Basketball: Fans almost overcrowded: Sasu Salin had fainted in the field
The basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his sysis-black U.S. match and beat Ukraine with his second half-blood-defying solutions.
But Salin transferred all the glory to the wolf fans - and did it in style:
I was going to get there at the end of the course, it was so great.
In my eyes, it became blurred, there was nothing I could do.
The noise and the white sea of the public was almost too much for me.
Salin’s power moments included nine surfaces at a fast pace, ball games, records, and shredding everywhere.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow mode that all worked out.
They just come from somewhere, now an incredibly important place," Sasu said.
That is my role.
Do all that.
Now it was great to see that others caught up with the plot.
It caught the whole gang.
The hall is a team’s joy pill and spirit creator, so it’s no wonder that his example raised the whole team on a flight that was too much for the big and rough five of Ukraine.
Finland at the World Cup after a 32-year break: Last time I remembered the outrageous referee game
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland’s lead coach at the 1982 Argentina World Cup.
It has been 32 years since Finland’s men’s volleyball team last played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland’s second coach and current player-agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament like yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the first round.
In that match, the referee game was blatant," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams were already on the back line.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it by 2-3, and then the pastes became more confused," said Parkkali.
Finland played the lead coach in the command of Heikki Montonen and finished 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world champions when Poland’s World Cup starts today on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The players’ strength values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is faster than ever," thought Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
The player material in Finland has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect that Finland will be able to continue from the first block.
Then you can get tight," Kosonen said.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victorious match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player at the World Cup.
Let's hope that 17th place will be added.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust," said Parkkali.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö ventilated in the Tunisia match.
The sauna and evening celebrations at the Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's programme at the 1982 World Championships.

Finnish tourists rescued a Cita dog from a mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog were in trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered brave help.
On the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paws.
The injured dog could no longer walk on steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I did not succeed, so I had to let it be.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little forward, but its legs just didn't carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, the nearby hotel or the passers-by.
In the dark of the evening, the situation started to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and Tuomo from his father.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway in Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain slope.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm with regard to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog," Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanomi in a message.
Soon a German man came along with a camping mattress.
From the mattress to Cita we got a pair of stretchers where the injured dog was moored.
The German man came after us to think about what to do with the dog and to carry the dog down the slope for a while, Soini says.

The dog was carried down with a hiking mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once more.
The son replied to him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn’t helped me, we wouldn’t have gone back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I did not thank them enough.
They certainly do not know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
On the night before Monday, the Soinis were on their way home.
They had heard from Mikkelsen: - Cita is already feeling better!

The beautiful and brave series "Beautiful and brave" returns to the screen today after a summer break.
The insinuating name of the opening period raises questions.
Finland’s most popular soap series of all time, Beautiful and brave, returns today from a summer break.
The name of the return period is suggestively "Oral happiness with Eric".
The following section is described in the programme description of the evening stand:
Eric and Donna talk about family relationships, order food, drink white wine and remember their love history.
Eric is loyal to his shirt style.
She has chosen white as the colour of the lunch shirt.
Ridge provides support to Katie in dealing with the traumas caused by her relationship with Brooke and Bill.

Brooke doesn't like a man going there trying to get her back.
I want Ridge, not you, Bill.
Genetic anomaly is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman was afraid of dying because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of her youth had only a few years left because she was diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as little is known about them.
It is estimated that about 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motor skills, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toe pain.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was in touch with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would go to a wheelchair before turning 18 and dying before reaching the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says, “As a child, I knew I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day and it took me longer than everyone else.
I could never skate or skateboard with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten his legs. When the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers saying he was suffering from FA.
I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA association,” he says.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and in a state of panic.
I thought I would go to a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose my entire functioning.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he stated that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, “Girl, I don’t think you have this disease, because otherwise you would already be in a wheelchair.”
I think you are suffering from a much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was going to be delayed,” he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a month of CMT to pay attention to the disease.
One hundred migrants found in a coal car in Macedonia
The Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the Macedonian Ministry of the Interior said on Monday.
The smugglers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late on Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from, and where they are going," said Ivo Koteski, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about 3 000 euros each to get to Greece, and another 800-900 euros to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel through a couple of million inhabitants of Macedonia on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have fled the Syrian civil war.

On the other hand, the sales of groceries have increased by almost one per cent.

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto's third reactor will be completed in mid-2016
Areva has submitted an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3 to the Finnish Industry Power TVO.
According to Areva’s press release, the recent delays in the project have mainly been due to the application for approval of the reactor’s automation systems.
The project is already years late.

Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare beachfront plot to Bottas - worth about 60000 euros
The Nastola municipal government donated a 1.4-hectare beachfront plot to formula driver Valtteri Bottas from Villähde.
The municipal government showed a fair sports mind and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel votes at the meeting when the decision was made on the plot, says Mayor Pauli Syrakki.
The gift plot of Bottas has the buildings of the farm - seven in total.
The municipality will dismantle them this year, with the exception of one.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the plot within two years.
We are delighted that he has enjoyed his birthplace and also wants to be here.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to tell about his sports career and his life.
And hopefully it will continue, says the mayor.
The mayor believes that the value of the beach plot is EUR 40000-60000.
The beach is shallow and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for more than ten years.
With varying success over the decades, Nastola has been successful in sports with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
The world javelin thrower Aki Parviainen and the aerobics champion Tuuli Matinsalo got detached plots from the municipality and built magnificent private houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved out.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola after the work and then changed the life situation as the situation changed elsewhere.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and his situation is different, Syrakki inches and believes Bottas will remain in his home town.
Hull hires attacker Hernandez with record amount
The Premier League club Hull invested the club’s record amount in the acquisition of Uruguayan team member Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez moves to Hull from Palermo for £9.5 million, or about £12 million.
The agreement is three years old.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo defeated Serie B and entered the Italian main league.
In the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
Last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez came in two matches to switch to the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time,” said Hull’s head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also announced that he had acquired Senegal's national captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russia's space trial failed - Gekots sent on a sex trip died
The five small geckos sent by Russia to expand into space have died, according to the Russian Federation Space Agency Roscosmos.
The Gekos travelled with the Photon-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Finland on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geeks in an unweighted state.
One male Gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds odd, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of geek eggs, for example.
Gecko effects can be used to predict the effects of weightlessness on a person while he or she is in a similar state for longer periods of time, New Statesman said in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and the causes or causes of death of the Geckos are investigated.
According to Interfax, the passengers who were crossed as "sex geeks" were frozen.
It is also surprising that the fruit flies that travelled with the same Foton-M4 survived the journey without difficulty, and also had offspring.
France arrests terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to have been a recruiter for a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
The authorities were able to trace the man after he had attracted money from a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but instead alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her intentions and told the authorities that the family had no relatives in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man's actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalised young people who are attracted to the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
The authorities estimate that around 800 French citizens or those in France who have been enrolled in the last conflict have travelled to Syria, returned from there or are currently planning to leave for Syria.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The basketball team's wishes for a further seat are in play when Finland faces Ukraine today in its second match at the World Cup.
If the opening loss to the United States had been expected, Ukraine would again be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning," Petteri Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a hundred-meter world championship three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter is a quick guy, but we've played against them before and we need to get our standard defense in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than the United States in its defeat yesterday.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee that a normal wolf pack will be seen on the field,” Möttölä said.
Hollywood stars' alleged naked images spread over the internet - part assured to be genuine
A number of naked images are spread on the Internet that are allegedly portrayed by well-known public figures.
Among other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "nakuva campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment by Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, representatives threatened.
According to TMZ, the actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the pictures of her are real.
She had taken these photos with her husband years ago.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible ailment was made for this.
I feel compassion for everyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actor Victoria Justice calls the images that go by her own name falsified.
There are also genuine or fake naked pictures of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalkeeper criticises his own: "Do not work hard enough to get out of here"
FC Honka is currently in the final place in the Veikkausliiga league.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala’s comments after Sunday’s VPS match describe the club’s confused current situation.
I have not had a goalkeeper for four months.
But we have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after a 1-2-loss.
Honka made a lot of mistakes especially in the first half of the game.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not happy about bad defensive play.
This summer, the player traffic in Hong Kong has been bustling, which is why the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
With the advent of player roulette, many young players have also been given opportunities that they might not even earn.
Some people are not working hard enough to get out of here sometimes," Viitala said without naming a single player.
Honga’s chief coach Shefki Kuqi agreed with Viitala to some extent.
After the game, I said to certain players that if you come to training and games to have fun and think you are a betting league player, and you don't have to work, then you're probably in the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I have given many young people time to play.
If they don’t want to take that place and take advantage of it, it’s not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that it is not possible to expect immediate success from the players when the players change constantly.
This season has not had twice in a row the same configuration.
Especially at the end of the defence, the group has changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
After the loss of the VPS, Honka is in series jumbo, with the last TPS in the equals.
There are seven more rounds left in the betting league, so the people of Espoo still have time to avoid falling to Ykkö.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop even now.
We will not really fall from this series," goalkeeper Viitala said.
Lars von Trier making TV series after decades of hiatus
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return to television series.
The Danish director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
Louise Vesth, the producer of Trier’s films, told about the series at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.
The production company Zentropa has announced that the series should start filming in 2016.

According to him, a similar series "has never been seen and will never be seen".
Hold your breath," Aalbæk Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his controversial media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom series to television.

Ice bucket challenge participant's chin dislocation
British Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to the treatment after she ran away from the Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jaw bone went out of place.
Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when she was poured with ice-cold water that she damaged the structure of her face.
The water was so cold that I only roared, but when I was roaring, I felt that my jaw started to stiffen,” he tells The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a moment before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing and began to laugh, but I had to rush to first aid.
The 20-year-old British who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital, where the jaw was put back in place.
The video clip has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
A perspective on howling wolves (kin): How can you explain the growth of the number of fans?
Today I had a great feeling.
This was said by basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland had played against France in the final European Championship at the Maroussi Ball Hall in Athens.
He did not exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
And so were about a hundred Finns who shouted noise at the 20 000 spectators, or else at the empty hall.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup Finland-Ukraine match?
In Bilbao, there are eighty times as many Finnish fans.
The 1995 European Championships was a time to look for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, such as Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä to the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far from wise, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
As far as I know, there were just over a hundred Finns at the Athens Games.
This included journalists, gamers' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there are a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
No one can say the exact number of Finnish racers.
The estimates have moved between 7 500-10 000.
Whatever the number in between, it is an incomprehensible number.
Here is an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global economy, companies move across borders.
In sports, we still have the opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys succeed in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Sports Sociology.
Certainly, both Spain and the World Volleyball Championships in Poland are Finnish who are looking for an experience.
Shared experience.
But that does not explain everything.
Sports itself must be attractive.
Itkonen makes sport a popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to a sporting event than to see art in Berlin.
Without success, the masses cannot be mobilized.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball federation and the players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took nearly ten years.
Then the direction changed and the team action was raised to the ground.
Volleyball people did the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports where the sacred trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnival support is, itkonen points out.
Can the ball sports transfer this massive interest to home series as well?
On average, basketball and volleyball are played for hundreds or just over a thousand viewers.
Itkonen thinks the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good for the species.
The second school believes that interest will shift.
The second is the one who does not want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the domestic series are not interested twice.
It is a challenge for society in the middle of the drug.
Confidence on Bottas plot - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola awards the formula driver Valtteri Bottas on the beach home plot.
The municipal government approved the transfer of the 1.4-hectare plot at its meeting unanimously on Monday.
In the future, a holiday home will rise on the plot.
The success of Bottas has been monitored in Nastola since his karting days.
He is seen as a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koikala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven demolished buildings in the area, six of which will be demolished by the end of this year.
Bottas reached Formula 1 in the Belgian competition with his fourth prize winner this year.
He is fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and has lived in Villähde.
She currently lives in England, but visits Nastola whenever she is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come - but hardly for the poor
It will present and test them in the U.S. Open tennis competition currently taking place in New York.
Ralph Lauren’s smart shirts are tested by the field’s ball players, but the amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top university players, also holds one.
According to him, the shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven into the nylon shirt, from which the information is transmitted to the mock-up on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The central moth is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house hasn't told you the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor did it even hint at its price, Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothing.
Californian Athos has sold a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 per piece and the required thumb-sized central unit costs $200.
Red Orbit also wrote about technowear.
A smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students from later years borrow their books for nominal remuneration instead of selling them straight away.
My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for it for the whole semester, plus a heavy sandwich,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last semester book would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University Board, the average student spends more than $1 200 per year on textbooks and school supplies, but there are many ways for students to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches like Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay significantly less for it than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc., which has more than 250 campus book stores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books in the university bookstores last spring were rental books, says Neebo company’s President, Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Webshops
In online stores, a new book can only be received at a third of the price it would cost in a campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler’s book “Calculus” is almost $290, but Chegg.com’s book is available for $239.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by the notes of others and the worn-out appearance.
For example, “Calculus” can be used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, a 25-year-old student at Brigham Young University, said he bought the book “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” from Amazon.com online store for just $0.42.
As a new book, it would cost $48.
University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls Director Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember them and do not need them once you have completed the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting a “Calculus” book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, use of the highlighter and payments for wear and tear.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of standard papers can also be a question.
Sometimes, these books are rented, and the e-book is paid for by its owner, e.g. Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
In the Chegg store, you can get the book “Calculus” as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because many classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors is a good idea, which option to choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be starting Pepperdine in law, recommends using the book ISBN to find out the price, as it can help ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to buy the book at full price from the University's bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, almost double the number of people killed in the fires compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring carried out by the Finnish Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have already died in the fires in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the deaths, 36, were men.
Ages over 65 have been 11.
According to the organisation’s statistics on fire deaths, the situation was last worse in 2009, when by the end of August 64 people had died in the fires.
The majority of fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in residential buildings and seven in terraced houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds us of the fire safety of the home.
At least all smoke detectors in the home should be checked.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial extinguishing equipment is easily put into service.
There must also be an unimpeded exit route from all premises in the home.
Children should also be informed of the electrical equipment they are allowed to use when they are home alone.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the city centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke with the protesters, who had even arrived from Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from the Australian Blue Mountains
Two teenage hikers were taken to safety after a night in the Blue Mountains in Australia's New South Wales area.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went to Blackheath for Govetts Leap on Sunday after noon.
The relatives were worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search patrol of local police and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the two were found at about 23 o'clock near the Bride Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and struck his head.
The police spent the night with a couple and were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have clashed with Russian tanks on the ground.
According to a representative of the army, the opponent's gunfire has been so accurate that Russian professional soldiers are likely to be involved in the shooting.
Over the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Sea of Azov off south-eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian patrol vessel, which received artillery hits yesterday, sank in the morning, says the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two have been lost.
The border guard had no certainty as to where the vessel was launched.
Yesterday, the separatists announced on social media that they had fired from the beginning.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that the Ukrainian forces immediately withdraw to positions from which they could not fire civilians.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the immediate ceasefire between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should be achieved without conditions in the Minsk negotiations today.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about our partners' actions, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused flooding in Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen as heavy rains hit southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimated that it might take some time to ease the flood, even though the rains were predicted to stop on Monday.
The heavy rains surprised the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given in advance.
The meteorologist Ari Mustala, who is on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that plagued the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it has been difficult to predict.
The French Socialists should “silently and help France,” Francois Hollande’s chief supporter says
Valls urged the deeply divided left to “show its feelings” to the difficult socialist president, whose composition of the new government did not obtain the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
Our job is to stay with him,” Valls said, earning applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government, despite the controversial 35-hour working week in France, to leave the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, earlier this week, the provocative proposal that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to work together with the government.
However, Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira caused dissent by appearing at a meeting of dissenting socialist MPs and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing “France to give up hope for the future”.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right national front, mocked the ongoing dissent of the socialists and said that he did not believe that the new government of Valls would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one did not last even for the summer.
And the new government will not last until autumn or winter,” Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to dissolve Parliament and was confident that his party would win early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far-right held the top spot in the May EU elections.
According to an opinion poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several competing groups before the end of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record-high unemployment.
There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that a change is taking place,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
Pokka cheated on Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda in the recorded part of the programme.
Last Thursday, the Finland programme published a fun video of recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page.
In the video, the hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record Finnish advertising puffs from the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go quite well.
Alm-Siira is confused in her words when she tries to pronounce the word budget discussion, and her confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their pockets time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow, says the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared on Facebook more than 10 000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the image agency of the magazine picture, was ranked third in the series of pottery in 1972.
The picture shows Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held at the Building of the Builders on Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki in May 1971.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the toilet, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to film.
I took this picture from four to five meters away.
The light and background were right.
Immediately I realized that this time I succeeded.
Meir's expression shows that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
Then you will be able to compete with pictures of well-known people or events.
It is great to be able to succeed with other images as well, as long as there is an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall picture of the Munich Olympics.
I did not send it to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation has already cost more than five million euros
The investigation of the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Drugs Unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki assessed his doctoral thesis in information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki argues that the supervision of the legality of police activities and the prevention of crime could be improved at all significantly by combining the IT systems of investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables the multi-use of forensic material.
He states that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate a crime is automatically a piece of electronic evidence that meets the chain of evidence, while at the same time enabling comprehensive judicial review.
The dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the wall of the school: "Fish and chicken foods included in the vegetable diet"
A picture of a special announcement on the wall of the Pirkka Women’s Travel School caused a food outcry in the social media, says Yle on its website.
The vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes are included in the vegetarian diet at school lunch.
Only when meat is on the list will we prepare a vegetable option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old bulletin that has been forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread on social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleanliness Services, says to Yle that a forgotten note on the wall is not correct and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in the past.
Every student gets a meal according to his/her wishes, he/she says to Yle.
Today, students in Pirkkala schools are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of their parents and a doctor or nurse's certificate of the vegetarian diet.
Vaarma argues that the solution for Yle is that young people’s vegetarian food experiments may leave food under-nourished, and that the lack of meat or chicken can cause surprise from the students’ parents.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise company, is negotiating to buy its rival Prestige Cruises International Inc. for $3 billion, from people closely involved.
With the deal, Norwegian Cruise, with a market capitalisation of $6.8 billion, would have access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information on a possible agreement may already be published this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce a result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be published, because there are no public negotiations.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments and Apollo refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when it was $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies such as the Chinese and Indian middle classes in the coming years.
The companies are competing to become the number one option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since 2007 with a value of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to published information, Genting’s share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo’s 20 per cent, and TPG Capital LP’s share was 8 per cent from the end of June onwards.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises in the cruise capacity in North America is 82%, according to a registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issuance of shares.
The Tampere City Board is dealing with the matter today.
Animalia hopes for solid support from the City Board.
According to Animalia’s Executive Director, Salla Tuomivaara, who is preparing her doctoral thesis for the University of Tampere, it is necessary to finish the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world as soon as possible.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a widespread view that the keeping of dolphin-like advanced mammals in dolphinariums is neither animal-friendly nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also be desirable for Tampere.
The closure of the Delfinarium is not only an animal rights issue, but also a question of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin strengthens the demands for the shutdown of dolphinarium activities.
Thus, death is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Soränniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put a stop to the deaths, close the dolphin prison, and find out how the dolphins in Tampere could be moved to a bordered sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
He had not experienced a return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will experience more than just an uninvigorated concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
Animalia aims to ban the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the ongoing comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act.
This includes dolphinariums.
In support of this demand, Animalia’s Executive Director, Tuomivaara, will participate in the demonstration on behalf of dolphins, which will take place today on 1.9.
The demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for the use of dolphinariums or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on a new state
Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “statehood” of the secession zone, according to Russian news sources.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's demand for negotiations with the Kiev government as equal partners in the negotiations with the Russian-minded rebels corresponds to his obvious strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists take over the region and thus to force the Ukrainian government to virtually grant the newly declared Novorossian independence, allowing it to head towards Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to reclaim the Separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which the Separatists captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently dubbed the region ‘Novorossija’, ‘New Russia’ – a term similar to the days of glory that preceded the revolutions of the Russian superpower.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tassi, Putin said that the planned peace talks are an “illusion” as long as Ukrainian politicians are campaigning for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces are attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the role of the state of south-eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there,” he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "statehood" is related to a broader independence, which has been discussed for months with Kiev's leadership in its attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the independence they need in the eastern regions,” Peskov says.
It is not possible to discuss this issue between Ukraine and Russia," Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesperson's commentary aimed at correcting the "false interpretation" of Putin's comments underscored that the Russian regime dealt with the separatist uprising in the eastern regions in a different way from that of Crimea, in which it effectively occupied an area with an ethnically Russian population of 2 million people.
Moscow would be much more difficult to connect with even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict opinion polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence that the Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would allow the local governments of Ukraine to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually the power in the region that links Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to the main Russian fleet as well as commercial maritime port areas and historical coastal sites.
There are also mines, factories and metal smelters in the area between Russia's Rostov and Crimea, which produce products that are vital to the Russian army.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine proposed that the Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of Ukraine’s non-core regions on their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatists perhaps armed and incited by Moscow.
Putin made his latest demand to the Kiev government for talks with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the coast of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the seizure of the Russian-backed separatists in the city of Novoazovsk is the beginning of a greater effort aimed at occupying the entire strategically significant coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to the strengthening of the city of Mariupol by massive civilians and military personnel, known as the steel-producing port city between Novoazovsky and a narrow area of land leading to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke in Brussels to the leaders of the European Union, asking for further measures to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
We will soon reach a point where there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any direct action decisions; leaders proposed further sanctions in order to introduce them if the Ukraine crisis re-emerges in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian tanks and 1 000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week in order to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers encircled by Russia in Ilovisk was replaced by 10 Russian parachute jumpers who were captured in Ukraine a week ago.
Milan’s opening goal was scored by Japanese skier Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari first hit and a little later Jeremy Menez on the penalty shootout.
Lazio, too, was hit hard at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In the coaching debut of Milan’s former attacker icon, Inzagh, the San Siro Stadium was only half-way.
The number of audiences in the match was reported to be 39 000.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the vortex of a naked picture scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he has been outraged by hackers who may have stolen the naked images of his engagement and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
In the entertainment world, there has been a stir since a series of Jennifer Lawrence naked pictures were posted on the internet as a result of a wide-ranging public image hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 naked pictures of the star Lawrence and other superstars such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and the actor Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Grecko, who live in Melbourne, have also apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
The list includes 101 names of celebs.
Last month, the commissioner of Grecko, Edelsten, said to the newspaper Confidential, "This is disgusting."
All personal contact and photos should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon in New York is reported to have commented on the incident in an online newspaper as "disgraceful" and said that the victims "feel ashamed".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with this previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer on the topless pool edge.
Palmer's film merits include the film "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the Chuck series Strahovski and the sucker punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence's representative said to TMZ that "this is a brazen violation of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen was angry with the hacker in his tweet: “The publication of photos stolen from a cell phone is no different from the sale of the stolen product in any way.”
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a purely legal point of view.
Finland played almost as if at home and won a sensational victory over Cuba at the World Volleyball Championships.
Look at the pictures of the fan drug.
Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red-white, but Finnish blue-white.
According to STT, Finland’s victory was followed by nearly 2000 Finnish supporters at the Spodek Arena.
It felt like playing at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our game," Finland's Captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland lost 0-2 in the match, but won 3-2 in the match.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle climb from behind six points.
Cuba was in the lead 16-10, but after that the Finns were charmed.
However, a couple of hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to the heavy fog.
So fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish fans of ball games have conquered Europe at a fast pace in recent days.
There are over 8000 Finnish fans at the World Basketball Championships in Bilbao, Spain.
As if every basket in Finland had been the winning basket for the match, US star Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's match.
The council meeting will not be sent directly due to technical problems
