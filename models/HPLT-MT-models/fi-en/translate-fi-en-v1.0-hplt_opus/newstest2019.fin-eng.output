Eemeli Kouki led to Hurricane's home win in the opening - Savo Volley's second win
Hurrikaani-Loimaa, who was awarded the Men’s Volleyball Championship medals seven times in a row, started the season 2018-19 with a home win when Raisio’s Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
All-rounder Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points more efficient than the hurricane.
There were some tunings abroad, but they did not happen, and then came a call from Loimaa.
It was quite quick to agree on what was going on," Kouki said.
Like Koukki, Tomi Rummunen supported Koukia with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a team hacker with a match-specific agreement with 17 points.
The win of the opening game is always important.
Many of the players had experience with the other side, and it added extra extra to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but the continuation of the medallion is of course a goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was 18 points more effective than Savo Volley when the team fell by Vieremä in the Vantaan Ducks 3-0.
Our game was volatile, especially at the head of attack, but fortunately we managed to squeeze out the victory.
At least I didn’t have any conscious different downloads when I played against my former team,” Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä Volleyball in the 2000-01 season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was happy with many things.
The hall was small, i.e. the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
A good feeling was left at home.
Miro was the king, Sillik played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielavesi's Sampo when Tuovinen was even the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective of the Ducks at 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Akaa-Volley
In the 2012-13 season, the winner of the league’s points exchange, Joni Mikkonen, has also started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season opening win after knocking down the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well on its own.
Today, of course, there was a loss close to us, as we were in the fourth round with a loss of 17-21.
We dug a lot of profit, and the fifth lot came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most powerful Tigers in the finals was the 28-point chipper Edvarts Buivids.
Compatriots Alexanders Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
There was almost no way to get a friend's chipper, Mikkonen praised.
Finland as world number one in human capital comparison
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, says Lancet, a scientific journal.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked the worst in comparison.
When measuring human capital, we look at the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has stated that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico under control, local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois stretched to greatness combat, and the Madrid team's local game ended in a goalless draw late on Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but Belgian guard Courtois managed to fight.
Courtois played at Atletico for three seasons while he was a Chelsea player.
At the beginning of the week, FIFA, the International Football Federation, selected him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale was awarded the best goal, but his shot passed at the end of the opening half of the goal.
Bale was replaced after a break due to a more femoral injury.
According to ESPN, the disillusioned Real fans shouted the name of the goaltender Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus.
The United States is now under attack against abortion law - A powerful document explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected as the candidate Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote would reverse the decision known as the "Roe against Wade" that made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights tell us how we have come to the current situation over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received various levels of support from the majority of the members of parliament in Finland.
At the beginning of the powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortionist doctor in the state of Missouri, has been blackmailed by the law.
The clinic's armed guard says he defends the freedom of religion in the United States.
The news videos are a reminder of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, the Lutheran Church Men’s Association advised women to reliable abortion doctors.
The interviewee’s arguments are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who has died from self-imposed abortion is enough.
The number of deaths in the United States was about 5000 per year.
The legalisation of abortions was particularly defended by the Republican Party.
Already in 1967 California was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later on, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began a revolutionary confusion of religion with a view to gathering voters.
His abortion strain also revolved around his successor - George Bush, senior.
Donald Trump did the same.
At the heart of the matter is the document, which is the basis for the politicisation of abortion.
When religious organisations that promote racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary political knots.
At the time of writing this, the President of the United States has chosen Kavanaugh, who is now accused by many women of sexual harassment, as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh can gain the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on the status of a Libra language.
Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children - major demonstrations at the border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel has fired on demonstrators in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: 12 and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and launched an air raid on the border zone as protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it has begun to use force so that the demonstrators do not break down the border fence or try to reach the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when the Palestinians started weekly protests at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12 000 people have been wounded.
The protesters called for Palestinian families to have access to areas where the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives from kites and helium balls sent from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty kick - he could not shoot himself
Wigan's topman, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have killed him with a back-tack in the penalty zone.
Judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa could not believe his eyes.
The situation seemed to bother Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty in the 85th minute when Pukki was killed.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic shook the 1-0 goal.
Pukki has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR with a style of chest muscle.
The work tasted like Pukki again.
After losing the ball, he continued to the end of the situation.
He created goals and stood up tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was the fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There is a five-win tube on the back.
The paedophile help service was immediately filled with reservations - around 40 000 people in Finland are interested in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-teens.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
People who are sexually interested in children or young people have been difficult to get help from.
The joint SeriE project between the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, a flood of e-mails and appointments began at Sexpo, providing counselling and therapy, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a source of shame for many.
Most of those who observe the paedophile feelings themselves have not made their fantasies come true and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that haunt and discourage them.
They also make normal life difficult, says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump won the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound strange, but based on betting odds, Trump is one of the biggest winners of the prize.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea at least at the level of talks to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their two countries.
The warm-up between Koreas is considerable, as last year the gaps were still blunt.
However, the award of Kim, who has spent years threatening and landing with nuclear weapons with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced on Monday, and Friday will be the day to receive the most attention, i.e. the Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to those involved in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
The esteemed gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been the victims of mass rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become the world’s leading expert in his field.
Through his work, Mukwege has paid attention to sexual violence, which is a horrifying by-product of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that 331 candidates will be awarded this year.
The names of the candidates will not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself would not mind if the Nobel Prize were given.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued to refer to the North Korean negotiations.
However, there are things that make Trump’s Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often recognised individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order – precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the twenty-first century, the prize has been awarded to three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
To reward Trump would therefore require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire notification in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on the 1st road in Lohja took place on 8 September.
Due to the notification, the traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a system failure, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Finnish Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened because there are drivers on the road after all, and they are driving how it hurts," the on-call fireman Pasi Kääriäinen told STT.
At that time, the motorway was even driven in the wrong direction just after a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, says Tapio Heiskanen, Head of Communications at the Finnish Transport Safety Agency.
According to traffic rules, only for a compelling reason can one stop on motorways and tunnels.
Traffic safety points out that in exceptional situations, you cannot start jeopardising traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be provided as accessible as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on a motorway is prohibited, in particular, as well as making and cancelling a u-turn.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels, where the headlights must always be switched on.
It is also forbidden to stop for no compelling reason, as is of course parking.
In the past, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity,” Heiskanen says in the Traffic Safety Bulletin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations, even though the ship was caught on the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans transported by the inland waterway M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on board their winning party, even though the ship had been caught in the lakebed by its bow, says Juho Syrjä, the ship’s manager at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late on Saturday evening and was stuck at the bottom of Vanajavesi in Akaa.
19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was injured.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on board until the morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them with a fire department to the port and a bus home,” Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 win for Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday’s hare was due to the fact that the surface of the water in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also made more difficult by the fact that the nearest fairway marker was covered with log debris, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more mentioned collision
Haveri took place on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the ferry route had crossed the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama in the case, as the speed of the vessel was very low at the time of the incident, and the impact on the bottom was not more noticeable.
According to Syrjä, being caught on the bottom has not caused any leaks or depressions on the ship, and the cruises on the ship will continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver went to check the condition of the ship before the ship was towed off the low ground.
As a matter of safety, we will still visit the shipyard to check that no damage was caused, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that M/S Tampere’s next cruise booked next weekend can be managed as agreed.
According to him, the cruise season of the ship will continue until the Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department received an alert on Saturday evening after just half a dozen.
The port of Viiala was alerted to ambulances receiving evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
On-call fire master Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and rather strong winds.
After half past three o'clock on the night of Sunday, the Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced that everyone on board had been evacuated and that passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruise ship was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Judge candidate for Trump accused of harassment and drunkenness may be left without a top position
Brett Kavanaugh, the judge of the U.S. Supreme Court, may well be deprived of the position he was looking for, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during their studies.
According to Aaltola, suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up in the office of someone else.
From time to time, it has happened in the United States that the President’s candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a lot of controversy.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
In this way, the President has been able to keep his face.
The appointment would rain down on the Democratic Party.
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision is likely to rain on the Democratic Party’s laary in the upcoming mid-term elections to Congress.
It would increase the enthusiasm for voting among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The appointment does not take place every presidential term, as in the United States the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at around the age of 70-80 at their own request.
Some Republicans hesitate to call themselves
A background study will normally be carried out on the candidates of the U.S. Supreme Court, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only set a week’s notice for the FBI’s further investigation, Aaltola says that it can still bring out something important.
Yes, it may.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or inadequacy for the post will still be widely discussed before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate by 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be put to the vote and the Republicans would disappear.
Woman Recognizes Salisbury Suspected Military Intelligence Agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she recognizes a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
Based on the photographs, the woman told us that it was Anatoli Chepiga, a military intelligence officer working at the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously reported revealing one of the men suspected of poisoning as Chepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that men's current identities are covert identities.
The BBC group traveled to the Far East near the border between Russia and China, where Chepiga grew up.
A woman living in a village recognized the young Chepigan Bellingcat for the pictures.
He identified the same man as a British police officer who appeared as Ruslan Boshirov himself today.
Russian men suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with neurotoxin Novitshok in March.
The skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga was awarded the Russian hero's honorary medal in 2014.
Russia denies the alleged GRU connection.
Men suspected of poisoning told Russian TV earlier in September that they had been tourists in Salisbury.
Old people as throwing bags in the health and social services reform
Now a living example of what the health and social services reform restriction defined by the Government of Sipilä means in practice has been obtained.
The social welfare and healthcare services of my municipality of birth Vaala are provided by the Oulunkaari Joint Municipal Authority, whose health service director has been elected the former regional director of Attendo in 2016.
The directors of the joint municipal authority warn the council of the restriction of change.
If the expenditure on health and social services now rises, the municipal government subsidies will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were alarmed, and most of them were ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would put an end to the institutional care of the health centre’s ward and a small unit of people with memory disorders.
Home health care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages will be torn from their roots next to the health centre to be treated at home.
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay its customers.
Vaala’s left did not swallow the bad preparation, but arranged a good public event, which included a lot of relatives, caregivers and also delegates from other parties.
On the slides of social welfare and health care, I presented how the municipality of Vaala already cares for the elderly at home the most in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Länsinen, the councillor of the neighbouring municipality, was also involved.
The local newspaper did a big story about the event, and it raised the Oulukaari bicycles to their hind legs.
The health and social services preparers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new care home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for the residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only speak of a service voucher, but do not indicate the level of care it provides or the personnel structure with which Attendo will take care of the elderly until the hospice.
Without a nurse?
For example, the health centre’s facilities will be closed due to the absence of a doctor’s night service.
Attendo will also rely on the doctors of the Vaala health centre.
The example of Vaala shows how central officials run delegates with insufficient information, and the delegates are injected against the back with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party will empty the inhabitants of Vaala, for who will remain insecure to live there voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was one of the election slogans in the city centre that the whole country should be inhabited?
President of Turkey Erdoğan opened a Grand Mosque in Cologne
In Germany, in the city of Cologne, thousands of people protested when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine from the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the protesters' signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10 000 people were expected to protest in advance, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
There were also supporters of Erdogan in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr. Erdoğan praised the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdoğan and Merkel pledged to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between the two countries on human rights issues, for example.
The review surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Laschet withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as the criticism of the visit by Erdogan accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, told me that he had come to an anti-Erdoğan demonstration in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjected to oppression.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final stage of the German tour of Erdogan in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
Slovakia charges three journalists with murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were accused of the murder of Kuciak and his betrothed in February, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in an investigation, but five of them were released.
In February, Kuciak was found shot with a betrothed from his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
The police have suspected the murders to be related to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and Kuciak's article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
Karelian distribution may have problems on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to the fault in printing, Sunday Karelian will also have to be mailed as unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas, where the distribution to the joint boxes will have to be carried out from the outer memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's magazine, and the problem may still continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra bundles of magazines in the province.
The newspapers of the other Finnish subscribers will only be mailed separately on Monday.
The distribution of these journals will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, the journalist Arto Nyberg will interview Vesa Heilala in his upcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling about his upcoming space trip, which he booked from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, for which a bank loan was needed.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
It now seems that after an unlucky test flight in 2014, which claimed the death of a victim, things are in the right place.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or no later than next year.
The flight number for Vesa is 300, which means that his trip is about a year from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at a height of 100 km, the Finnish astronaut will tell you about the future on his website.
At the same address, he also backs his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book entitled Space Travel and saw Star Trek on television.
Star Wars has been seen, and that's what the idea of...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host
Manchester City continued its undefeated run in the Premier League as it fell home on Saturday with Brighton goals of 2-0.
The sixth season of the governing champion team is guaranteed by the paint sprayers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth hit of the season from a close-up to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute at the back of the Brighton goal.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he saw Sterling back with the Brighton defense at the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentinian was able to place the final 2-0 at the penalty spot easily.
With six wins and one draw, City leads the Premier League with 19 points.
However, one less-played match Liverpool is only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in its seventh round on Saturday night.
Youth clubs select new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Association selected new decision-makers for its next three-year term in 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen as Vice Chairman from Häme.
The council was elected by 40 actual members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Association will announce on Sunday.
A youth association meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
In its three-year operational goals, the Youth Society Conference in Joensuu gives three promises: to keep the doors open for everyone, to organise equal recreational activities regardless of the municipality of residence and background, and to support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths,” the Finnish Youth Association says in a statement.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and was astonished at Ferrari: "Lost a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, Mersu’s British driver was asked whether he believed that Kimi Räikkönen’s release from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton in the end of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari reported that Räikkönen will not continue in the team next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen would put gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It makes no sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I was dreaming of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day long.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with a Russian race.
From the pole position at 14 o'clock, Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes will take off.
The evening magazine follows the competition moment by moment.
Football’s A-juvenile championship became a full farce: only 7 players came to the scene
The top league level of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
Before the start of the 13 o’clock round, the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy has enough points against Vasa IFK in practice.
In order for the situation to reverse in the final round, the second Lynx in the championship must win the PK-35 and hope for the defeat of the Lahti people.
However, the Lahti championship was confirmed in practice even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer people in Vaasa, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
During the break, the Lahti residents led 7-0.
One of the reasons why the players in Vaasa are missing is that the team has played part of the A-juveniles’ Finnish Championship, the P20 series, and Men’s Kakkonen’s C-block.
Vasa IFK has played in 2 against the fall of the season.
During the final round on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win the JBK away in the away game, and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own away against KuFu in Siilinjärvi Toivala.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - according to the rescue service, luck was involved
The passenger car drifted out of the road and ended up on its roof at Eno on Juttuvaarantie on Sunday at 9 a.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, the rescue department reports.
Good luck, says the press release.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet after the rain.
The police patrol visited the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new means of inquiry: Equipment procurements and recruitments have already been made, there is no whispering of planned activities abroad
According to Supo’s chief, Antti Pelttari, the Intelligence Act has been prepared for by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, a permanent increase of approximately EUR 10 million would be added to the budget.
In the premises of the Helsinki Airport’s Police of Protection (Supon), we are already preparing for the full entry into force of intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, Supo’s Chief of Staff, tells the Western Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence mandates.
Serena Williams in a video where she sings in the topless - campaigns for breast cancer awareness
The tennis superstar Serena Williams is back in shock.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on her Instagram account in which she sings only hands in front of her breasts, AFP says.
The song is The Divinyls' 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the activities of the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
I recorded The Divinyls’ worldwide hit to remind women to regularly do self-checks,” Williams writes in an Instagram post.
And yes, this set me up in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of the color of the skin, all over the world.
Early detection is all about a and o - it saves many lives.
The Divinyls song is written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made in honour of Chrissy Amphlett.
He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams said.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the comments in the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams left the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There is a stir in the United States Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the match and claimed, among other things, that males are accepted for much more violent behaviour than female players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain path is not suitable for people with heights
In addition to traditional Chinese cuisine, the restaurant has a fantastic view.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
It is literally located on the cliff.
You can look at the forest below if you wish.
The rugged scenery at the heights makes restaurant visitors breathe in the mountains of Longquan.
Getting to the restaurant requires a hike in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19.9.2018.
YouTube comments wonder where the restaurant’s toilet is located.
Walking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the location is explained.
Korpela alley runs out today: This is how it all ends
All good things will end in time.
Today, this is what happens to the Finnish country drama Korpela’s alley run, which has been quite well-liked.
The third season has gone like a hot rock: last week, the episode was first seen on TV by 722 000 Finns.
The top figures themselves are no longer of practical importance, as there is no continuation of the series by Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirku are again taking a big leap forward, and Jaska’s mother is probably the first to guess what is to come.
Even between Anssi and Miisa are warm, romantic in the light of recent events, but then Laiho appears again.
The police are also suspicious of the man.
However, no one can foresee the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets amazing news.
The last will of a long time is revealed, which brings a woman to the brink of tears.
After a week on Sunday evenings, Sorjonen will continue in new periods.
Korpela alley running today on TV1 at 21.05.
Should I go to work tomorrow for a cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many will decide whether to stay at home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go for treatment, as the disease can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may already be infecting others, even if your own symptoms feel small, says the Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted the day before the symptoms start and from five days to a week.
Children may be infected with the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can come back to work when the cough eases and there is no fever anymore, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast to return to the hall will slow the recovery.
In addition, be sure to wash your hands, put them in a handkerchief, and throw them away.
However, is it painful to move?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
You should not put your fingers in your nose or mouth," Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited to the mask.
How to avoid infection?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats the miss tradition: "My husband is a ice hockey player"
Ice hockey players and missions are often linked.
This was the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finnish Crown has received Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is an Ingrian Finn and her father is a Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school for his father's Russian presence.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for my Russianness.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all," Alina says at the semi-finalist event of the Miss Finland competition.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon she found new friends, and the everyday life started rolling out hopefully.
At the age of 15, you think you are an adult, but I really wasn’t thinking about that afterwards.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonas Hurri, who is familiar with the Pelicans.
After a career in the Finnish ice hockey league, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18th World Championships.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived almost a year remotely, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could make it to the winning trio and get me a career, I don’t want to believe that it would have any effect on our relationship.
Even if we have to live separately, we have good trust and the good thing about the distance is that the spark always stays above us," Alina grinned in May.
Rejoice in the constant growth, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the Earth’s resilience.
However, there is almost nothing to give up.
Sustainable alternatives are being sought for continuous growth, but the theory of moderation also encounters major problems.
The continued growth of the economy has created a standard of living for ordinary people over a few generations, especially in the northern hemisphere, from which we could only dream.
However, the long-term overrun of the Earth’s carrying capacity and climate change make this cornerstone of the market economy destabilise threateningly.
Two men were stabbed on the night of Sunday in Kannelmäki at Sitrator at four o'clock in the morning.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing, and another, born in 1968, was less likely to be injured.
Older men have already left the hospital.
The police have apprehended one person, whose share of the stabbing will be investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect involved in the incident.
Events are investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
An important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's goal against Inter scored an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt completed the 1-1 match by 78 minutes.
Silvelholt got through the right side and fortunately raised the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With the guest draw, the Mariehamn reached the two points of the Turku Football Club, which was the place for the champion.
An important goal and a valuable point, summarized Peter Lundberg, Principal Coach of Mariehamn.
Lundberg said that the team did not start what he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but fortunately the goal of the Turku residents brought us more strongly into the game.
John Allen, head coach of the home team Inter, said the game was under control, but the goal was once again painful.
One defense mistake took us a full score, Allen regretted.
Again, we were the best!
Finland has the most human value in the world
Finland has ranked number one in the comparison of 195 countries.
The study measured the health and education of the people.
Finland is the best country in the world if it is measured by human capital.
Finland ranked number one in the survey, which measured citizens’ health and education as well as learning.
The study measured the change in capital from 1990 to 2016.
The study was published by The Lancet.
According to the summary, human capital will have a significant impact on how the national economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation is in Africa.
The countries of the continent took the seven worst places in the comparison.
It's Niger's back.
This was first reported by STT.
The magazine showed its underpowering skills, the venue is not yet certain
Jori Lehter's strong underpower play came up when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played their final practice match before the season's start.
Philadelphia defeated Boston 4-1, and Lehter fed Michael Raffl twice to score.
In the last few days, Lehter has been on the agenda due to suspicions of drugs.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in drug gangs, where some are suspected of drug use and some are suspected of selling, for example.
The newspaper has denied that it has committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the issue, and the NHL is investigating the case.
After the match, Sam Carchidi, editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer magazine, who closely follows the Flyers, estimated that Lehterä belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom will gain a seat on the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehter was excellent in the training match.
In the second installment, Lehterä fought the disc himself with an underpower, drew the defender to him, and fed the goal to the open position of Raffli, who was waiting for the goal.
For the second time, the duo's collaboration brought the goal at the very end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaanainen is waiting for the team’s coaching management to decide whether to join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide whether to play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL," he said in an interview published on Boston's Twitter account.
Literally trained in the river boys, he played against Philadelphia for 19:31 minutes.
With Boston's goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.
Flies-backed defender Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit when the team fell Toronto 5-1.
In the ranks of Calgary, Lynx grew up, defenseman Juuso Välimäki got a point of entry, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested on Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koskinen.
Aleksander Barkov of Florida played for more than 20 minutes and scored a goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara entered the final round of his team's consolation goal when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the lost goal, Jonas Korpisalo rejected 23/27 discs.
More than 180 000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to a survey concerning the decision on Finland’s future time.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already gathered more than 180 000 responses.
The questionnaire opened in Otakantaa.fi can be answered for less than a couple of weeks.
The respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time as other Nordic, Baltic, Central Europe or Western Russia.
A recent picture shows a change: The strongest man in the world lost dozens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world’s strongest man, is undergoing a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted for the title of the strongest man in the world for a long time.
Hall could eat up to 10 000 kilocalories of food a day and weighed 200 kilos at its highest, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were in size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he was doing his body damage.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted the world's strongest man to win by all means and the family man promised to finish his career if he got the title.
Hall did not want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the April 2018 World's Strongest Man competition.
Hall recently published a photo on Instagram, in which he poses in a much thinner condition than his active career.
Hall writes that its current weight is 169.5 kg.
Hall wrote that he was currently training five times a week aerobically.
The programme includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four training sessions a week in the gym.
This year’s strongest man was Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, an Icelandic character from the Game of Thrones TV series.
The last Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed in Pyhäjärvi - "Sturdy closed with a rock"
The inland waterway M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday evening at Akaa in Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department received a warning of a water traffic accident on Friday night after half a dozen.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has been wrecked, and is firmly attached to its bow with a rock," said Matti Willman, fire officer on duty.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the Rescue Department, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated from the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus towards Tampere, says Chief of Staff Jari Nieminen to STT after 1am at night.
Ambulances were alerted to evacuated passengers at the port of Viiala.
For some reason, the ship, which had travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police investigate the cause of the events.
On-call fire master Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and rather strong winds.
According to the Rescue Department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship is apparently not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers begin to check the situation there.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is an inland waterway vessel currently serving as a restaurant ship, with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
There is also a meeting room for private use on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruise ship has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand outstanding commissions from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius' evening match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on a challenge application submitted by Boxing Manager Jaakko Helminen and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius and his late-payment interest will be charged a total of more than 80 000 euros in unpaid manager fees.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We have tried to reconcile, but there is no other option.
There has been a clear assignment here, and a great deal of work has been done,” says Kokkila to Ilta-Sanomat.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a response to the evening newspaper, explaining the boxer’s vision of the events.
Helenius disputes that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the respondent, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsor income for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay only percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly affirmed that Helenius does not have to pay anything, just receive the income they have arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice of professional sports managers.
Salary work has never been agreed and it would have been absurd in the situation of Helenius, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on the cooperation.
According to the respondent, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not receive a draft until the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal was bad for himself and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius had never been in contact with Kokkila and Helminen.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned an "unidentified but significant" decline from the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been brought.
Helenius considers the subsequent activities of Helminen and Kokkila to be cowardly, says the reply.
Today, Helenius meets Erkan Teperin, seventh on the heavyweight challenger list of the Boxing Federation IBF in Stuttgart.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
At the age of 83, long-term radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer.
The death announcement of the presenter was published in the Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
It is reported that Pälli died on 3 September.
He told about a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by information about the fate of his acquaintance.
He had already said goodbye on Facebook, says Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli to be a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Pälli was a liked person who had fast-track hoksets and fun stuff.
I got to know Erkki as a little boy when I first visited Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a storeman.
We met with Erkki then.
He was then a spokesperson for Finnlevy and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I progressed to make music productions, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a standard journalist at all parties to do stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw how big a fire he had on entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a heartfelt man and a good journalist.
For many, he became known as a well-respected radio host of Yle, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Erkki also talked to me many times.
He was good at speaking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked not only with the journalist but also with the Fazer label Toivo Kärki.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's albums.
His greatest passion, however, was radio work, in which he had an original style.
He has been doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became known to many listeners in the ether of Yle.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The association describes the "full-turn" experienced in its economic situation, although the economy is burdened by "significant debt on the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the rapid response and strict financial discipline.
Last autumn, we reacted as quickly as possible by taking adjustment measures.
The careful planning of operations and financial management have been instilled throughout our organisation, says Kulmala in a press release.
We have also been very successful in our partner acquisition, and in addition, the return on the World Cups was excellent in the past competition season.
However, in the future too, cost management must be precise, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of corpses are lying in the backyard of the hospital in the town of Return on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled to assess the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to aftershocks.
One of the hospital residents was a 52-year-old returnee, Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child and he is missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the Army Hospital yard area, Palu lay Dwi Haris, who has been injured in his back and arm.
He was at the start of the quake at a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to return to the wedding party.
I probably got squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe," Haris told AP, according to British media.
Small shops looted
At the return evacuation centre, the 35-year-old mother of a small baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tight.
There is little clean water.
Small shops are looted everywhere,” Kusuma said.
Many residents of Palu have been sleeping outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house was kind of erect, possible aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants.
According to news agency AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu’s prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there may be around 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in the Donggala prison have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners incarcerated and set the prison on fire after the guards had told them not to go looking for relatives who had suffered from earthquakes and tsunamis.
The return airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land on the ground was an army C-130 transport aircraft, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to the return airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land on the ground without the help of air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was badly damaged during the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long rainy area from the west on the night of Sunday spreads over the whole country, says the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The rain mostly comes as water, but in Central and Northern Lapland sleet or snow is expected.
The frosts of the previous night are not repeating, because under the cloud cover the temperatures remain higher.
A cloudier night will keep the lowest temperatures in check.
In the west, you can visit the freezing side for a moment," said Ville Ilkka, a meteorologist on duty.
On Sunday, the rainy area moves eastwards during the morning.
In the south and west there are brisk or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more volatile.
Wind and wave warnings apply in marine areas.
The actual autumn storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be varying weather in the typical autumn.
The autumn is now really starting to push on," Ilkka said.
Miss Finland Final not on TV
From IL-TV, you can follow the glamor and sparkle of the Miss Finland red carpet.
Iltalehti’s entertainment editors will broadcast live on IL-TV from Miss Finland’s red carpet from Billnäs’s ironworks.
The broadcast starts around 18.50.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned with ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at Billnäs ironworks in Raasepori.
Before the finale begins, you can watch the atmosphere on the spot on the IL-TV live broadcast.
The live broadcast starts around 18.30 and continues for about an hour.
This year’s final has attracted a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners from previous years.
They will be represented by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus in 1998.
Other representatives of the jury include the welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, the photographer Nadi Hammouda, the Managing Director of Jouni’s Trade, Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen, and Seiska’s news producer, Katja Lintunen.
We wanted him to go to university before he went to the Miss Games.
His Russian father Dimitri and his mother Svetlana believed in her daughter’s success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the recent Miss Suomen Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed her daughter’s first moments at the end of the crown.
They came to the public from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingredient and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived all her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting than Miss's career when she was a child.
Alina was often told that when she is so pretty that she should start as a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio presenter.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty contests.
The parents wanted Alina to go to university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
This is what happened, and in the end Alina wanted to take a bachelor’s degree before the Miss Games.
Last year we asked him why he didn't participate, but he wanted to finish his bachelor's degree.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults alike.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend, Jonas Hurri, is working in Japan and was not able to encourage Finland to love the final.
Alina’s parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts a miss year.
Yes, that is the purpose!
The parents hoped that the daughter would soon be able to visit.
Now there has been such a long break from visits due to the miscarriage.
I am already missing, even though I have sent you messages.
Young man killed in overdrive in Lahti - police arrested three people
According to the police, three people have been arrested as a result of the incident.
On Saturday, the Häme police did not comment on the course of the events or on the possible intentionality of the overrun, on the grounds of the incompleteness of the investigation.
The police also did not comment on whether the persons caught and the man killed in the overdrive knew each other.
More information on the case will be available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - thought of the idea of a cartoon: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At the time, Organic Hump started with my husband’s statement, in which he suggested it as a person for the story I have developed, says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger, a housewife and a former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says that she was a European translator in Brussels for economic and legal affairs until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed being a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind what to do when I was old, when even the smallest child started to be big.
Then there was a cartoon in the 2014 picture.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was little.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these manuscripts of Organic Hump started to emerge, the situation changed.
At first, I made dozens of manuscripts in a desk.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled artist, but I was unable to attract her until the summer of 2016, when I donated Viivi with the help of a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen stripes, and then he had to start trying himself, says Piippo, who says that the drawing board was a great incentive for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evening.
Manuscripts are constantly popping into my mind, but usually I don't make one at a time.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time and I would love to play with the colors.
It is always the hardest thing to start drawing, because drawing is not my strongest type.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates the contemporary comics of the newspapers, including Scott Adams' Dilbert.
The characters of the organic hemp are a carrot-bodied mother with a salad-haired baby who has taken the L-theme.
Other characters are Man, Pisces and Twins.
In the organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer forced buns, even though she sometimes intrudes on Organic Hump.
Piippo says that he reads his series with his husband and children.
After all, that’s such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you’re drawing and say that this is what I’ve done today.
And there are plenty of challenges for the housewives!
The Organic Hump series can be read online at organichomppa.sarjakuvablogt.com

The other player was an online player from Vaasa.
Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrifices himself - leaves no cracking tower until hundreds of passengers are safe
The 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthony Gunawan Agung has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until he was able to safely transport a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from the earthquake-stricken island.
The young man was in charge of the air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the town of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While others were fleeing from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to steer Batik Air from the runway to the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower shook and cracked.
In the end, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His legs were broken and he suffered serious injuries to the internal organs.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation administration representative told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify as the flight entered the air, and its intensity was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Rehn ponders on Europe's ending in a trade war: "You have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Director General Olli Rehn said in YLE’s first morning that even though tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies’ investment decisions.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is very good at making a profit so far.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
Rehn believes that Europe does not seem to be grinding at the feet of a trade war.
You have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the entire Western world.
The market reacted violently yesterday on Thursday evening to the clearly deficit budget of the Italian government.
The deficit for next year is more than 2.4 per cent of the national product.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country’s loan stock is problem loans and non-systematic loans are over ten per cent.
In addition, its public finances are at a low level and the country again seems to exceed its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worthwhile to paint new crises, Rehn replied when asked if Italy is taking Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another issue facing Europe is Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would be in harmony.
The disputed difference would have a much more negative effect.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will resign in just over a year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen has appeared in speeches.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said, adding that he is not going to comment further.
HS's super-popular Black Box shows continue next week - last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the coming week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
On 23 October, the Black Box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets available for sale at the National Theatre.
The performance in Tampere is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers on the stage will tell their long-prepared true story, which has not previously been published in any instrument of HS.
There is again something that no one has ever heard of.
There is a strange spy on the night of Helsinki, your impressive report from the other side of the globe and an interesting story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organizing live journalism for three years.
From the beginning, they have been popular and often sold out.
More than 15 000 people have already visited the stand.
The black box was awarded at the Bonner gala as a journalist of the year.
The awardees thanked the new way of doing journalism and the journalists’ willingness to come close to their readers.
The black box of the spring season 2019 will be seen at the National Theatre in March and April.
The performance will also be visited in Tampere and Turku.
At that time, the presentation will have different content than the evenings of this autumn.
A lost mushroom finder was found thanks to an "unprejudiced experiment"
The drone expertise of the Finnish police is among the world's top: "We are being asked about training"
According to the Rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, the police can use drones in addition to the search for missing persons, for example, in crime scene investigations and reconnaissance missions.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a lost sponger with a drone in only a couple of minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, head of the Police College University of Applied Sciences, pointed out, among other things, that "with the help of open-minded experimentation and effective training, we are also among the world leaders in this area".
Drone is a fairly new capercaillie and all the more recent in police duties.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been clarified, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, says Himberg.
There would be a lot of visitors to see the drone activities of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
Increasingly
Himberg points out that finding the lost in winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible is very important.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found using a drone in just a couple of minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are meant to be trained more.
Even now, drones are being used for police missions, and their use is becoming more common and increasing in the future.
That is what I would dare to say, Himberg says.
In addition to the search for missing persons, the police can use drones for example in accident or crime scene investigations and certain intelligence missions.
For example, you need to check out an area a little further away, where you may be afraid of being subjected to violence.
The drone can then be used for pre-intelligence.
Karelian Rugby entered the first division
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of the 2-division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and porched the southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew about the historic rise of the Karelian Rugby to the 1st division.
In the past, the club has played in number one, but at the time, the Finnish rugby division had been divided into two levels, the Finnish Championship and a multi-block 1 division.
The club is going to accept the series, but it will know a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of less than 20 players must be increased to 25.
Division 1 is also aware of the increase in the number of games and longer journeys, so the fundraising must also be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Head coach Claude Julien, who plays in the NHL, confirmed on the club’s Twitter account that Finnish striker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise in the first round of Kotkaniemi, 18, with three summer bookings.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has shown strong grips in September's training matches.
Kotkaniemi immediately managed to score in his first training match.
Head coach Julien said that Finland had taken big steps after arriving at the camp.
The NHL regular season starts on Thursday night in Finland.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
A lot has been said about leadership in Finland this week.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Nokia Board, told HS in an interview with his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but earlier Nokia reports have also talked about the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company’s risk-taking and agility in the upswing phase disappeared.
During the week, a business giant Nordic Business Forum was held in Helsinki, which drew the Finnish business cream to the Fair Centre.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world entered the stage.
There was talk of good leadership.
Gary Hamel, the legend of management, said that a good manager must have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most mentally attached to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods chain, said that the manager should be able to communicate with the entire staff for the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot be simply to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, the author of the success book on Introverts, said that the most successful leaders have been found to be humble.
They act calmly, silently and calmly.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the life cycle of a company.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company’s future is based.
A company that has grown into a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to by 7 500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum – mostly by Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of being indignant.
A good manager is required a lot.
That’s why management often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They were talking to each other behind the scenes in a friendly manner.
However, they were hardly wondering if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And it was not easy to evaluate their humility.
Sara Chafak arrives on a stunning red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Missing Final in a stunning black dress.
There was also a lace-up dress in Miss Finland in 2012.
A little bit of jet lag.
I came again from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to LA for a photoshoot.
Among other things, he has made advertising descriptions.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting and similar to that in Finland.
However, he believes that work needs to be done even harder, as there is always a replacement for the work of the model.
You have to push harder and be aggressive,” Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors wins €30 000 live art prize in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth 30 000 euros on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, who has been awarded the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works with choreography, community activism and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to its surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments where they have previously been lacking, the jury described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, the nominees were a group of international artists.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
The Danish police found Volvo in a major operation: "We can't tell you where"
Extensive searches by the Danish police have yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed at the Øresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själland were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The car you are looking for has been found.
We cannot yet tell where the car was found," Henrik Storm told Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the sought-after black Volvo has no direct contact with the threat.
According to him, the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Extra Bladet told the police about Saturday's press conference.
Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was responsible for the operation.
He did not want to tell us by which criminal name the case is being investigated.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people’s lives.
Three people have been sought in the operation.
The police will not tell you if they have already been arrested.
According to the newspaper, restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also monitored the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the general public no longer has any cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of dissent - now the people vote on the issue in disputed elections
A new name for the country is currently being voted on in Macedonia, which is located in the Balkans.
According to the agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia’s efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter is in favour of Macedonia’s membership of the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement.
The vote started slowly, at least at the school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
Retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, wanted support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the door to Europe and NATO.
This means a change, especially for young people," he said.
Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been officially referred to as the Republic of Former Yugoslavia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting whether the voter turnout will rise by more than the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to amend the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament must also approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. in Finland.
A great victory!
Robert Helenius knocks out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany late on Saturday evening.
A 34-year-old Finn took a measure of his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
The winner will be given the opportunity to take on tougher tasks than those seen on Saturday, which are of considerable economic importance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked off Teper with his hard left hand stroke.
Teper was no longer able to get up from the floor.
The "Nordic Nightmare" already hurt its opponent in the third round, when the German nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They had to fight in December 2015.
Teper then appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it turned out that Germany had twice been subjected to the doping test.
Helenius has taken his name from his professional career in 28 games and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches and lost three times in his career.
Hamilton orders victory - the difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One Championship title was once again coming to a conclusion, with Mercedes Lewis Hamilton winning the Russian GP and stretching his World Championship point lead to Ferrari Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas drove second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel was third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started from the last line of departure, was the fifth.
The two were assaulted by a Jewish man in Joensuu - caught at the end of a block
Two men beaten and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 18 o'clock.
According to the police, the men also seized the victim's phone.
The police found the suspects, a 35-year-old man with hay water and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, at the end of the block shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, the police said.
The victim received bruises that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, will leave his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities on this.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for saying that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada fights against time to reach an agreement on Naft with the United States
Time threatens to run out in the negotiations between the United States and Canada for a free trade agreement with Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators of the two countries have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly in order to fully focus on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement with each other, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before the Mexican presidential election, andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that it is not necessary for Canada to be included in the agreement.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign an agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Due to these schedules, the agreement text between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow enough time for the U.S. Congress to assess it.
A neighbour thought the candles were blazing as a fire in Kaakkuri - the fire brigade was alerted to the scene
The candles burned in the apartment building in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night of Sunday.
A dozen units of rescue services were alerted due to a possible fire in the apartment building.
It was found out that the candles burned in the sauna in the apartment building had looked like a fire in the opposite house, which was why the emergency department had been notified.
There was no fire.
Police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - rattling on the ground and at the metro station
Police arrested eleven people after the men’s football league, played in Espoo on Saturday, after the Honka-HJK match, the crime of the West Uusimaa Police Department was confirmed by Teemu Värtinen to STT.
The reason for the arrest was protection against crime and disturbance.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
Ilta-Sanomat reported earlier on the arrests.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed into the field from the stand reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to knocking and fist fighting between the supporters of the teams.
In order to end the situation, e.g. riding police officers were needed.
In addition to the field, there was rattling in the vicinity of the metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I was not there, but what I saw from the pictures was uncomfortable," Värtinen referred to the brawling in the field.
According to Värtinen, no crime reports have been made as a result of the events.
Table stone alarmed the butterfly swimming in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöykivi have made progress to the finals on the closing day of the 3/7 World Cup in the Netherlands.
The races will be swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS’s Tablestone was alarming his Finnish record in a 50-metre butterfly swim, where he was second in the initial batches at 22.82.
Earlier in September, Tablestone swam in Helsinki during the SE period 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was the 24th time of the butterfly swimming 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatti’s Laukkanen was sixth in the first half of the 50-metre breaststroke with 30.48 and reached the final.
In the initial batches of two hundred metres of confusion, Laukkanen was 15th in 2.14.25.
Students play a rare delicacy: an ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects with its visuality
The tragedies of ancient times are rare in Finnish theatres.
For example, the National Theatre last saw an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now, the Theatre Academy brought to the tour, starting with the National Theatre, Aeschylus Oresteia, the only full-length drama.
In the stage open! projects that started in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere of Oresteia took place in Berlin in April.
The Roiha Atonement for Oresteia summarises the story of the end of the blood vengeance of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law for an hour and twenty minutes, especially by condensing the parts of the choir.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuu’s fine translation (2003).
The unveiling of dramatic lights and theatre space highlights the simplistic and bright stage thinking.
It focuses on the dynamics between the performers who play the name roles and the chorus.
The performance uses both double and triple interpretations of the name roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon and Cassandra, who are returning from the Trojan War, are shown on the stage, unlike what was customary in the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize that it is faithful to the tradition of ancient performance.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created in front of the viewer’s eyes, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to bring up the master’s stage of acting students as a close-knit group, just one organism, a rhythmic group.
In choir sections, in particular, the highly expressive, sculptural group formations give the actors flexible access to their rights on the bare stage, decorated only by a white curtain.
Impressive.
Oresteia’s performance tour continues at the Kouvola and Oulu Theatres.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen load
This is beginning to show in Europe, thanks in particular to the cooperation agreement between Hyundai and H2 Energy in Switzerland.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hannover IAA Commercial Vehicle Show, Hyundai will provide a new model for a thousand vehicle batches for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By launching a fuel cell truck, Hyundai will continue on the path of the Nexo and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network," In Cheol Lee, vice president of Hyundai Motor, said at the launch of the contract.
Fists fluttered several times in Kajaani
A little over thirty-year-old man assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the place.
Outside he shoved another man to the ground, and in the absence of the third man, the abuser also struck him.
The police arrested the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kick the other policeman in the foot.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the tube to calm down.
The case is investigated as three acts of assault and violent opposition by an official.
Another assault occurred on Saturday morning in the middle of the street.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, a man of about 20 years of age in Kajaani hit the victim.
A little later, another man poured him on the ground and the man who had previously hit him was still kicking the victim.
The attackers were pulled away from the victim by outsiders and the police were called.
However, the perpetrators had time to leave before the police arrived.
The police will ask the eyewitnesses of the event to contact the Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at investigation.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long-line radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as the long-term journalist of Yle, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is going on now.
Even the doctor has said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation in the evening newspaper a month ago.
The safety of the store’s aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
For the first time in 1984, I was paid a salary for a newspaper article.
When these annual tyres have something to do with surprise, it’s usually big news.
When I wrote (Karelian, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was astonished and even momentarily a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, working environment expert at the Finnish Service Union (PAM).
He says that crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly perceived as serious are reported to the police, and many real situations of violence remain unreported.
Of course, companies have a duty to record their near misses on the basis of the Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere,” he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in statistics.
In situations of violence, the problem has always been that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Despite this, psychological traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the situation of violence and the threat of violence is difficult to draw, when even a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid of their workplace, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were freed, there was also a considerable amount of media hype about the impact it had on the safety of the sellers.
At that time, quite a few employers arranged guard services at least for night hours and to prevent working alone,” Kähärä says.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this is creating a new negative trend.
When, due to security, the incidents remained well under control, the impression emerged that security would be unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
Mild assault is a criminal offence against the parties, and it is quite understandable that the abused seller does not want to make an investigation request about a criminal who usually lives near a shop.
But according to the same point laid down in the 2011 Act, mild abuse becomes subject to the prosecution if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is abused, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should be prosecuted.
When the court put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from there at the hard end of the scale, the customs would be cleaned up.
A society where the grocery store has to be open almost day and night in small towns must guarantee the safety of the store’s employees.
Heidi Sohlberg acknowledged to the miss before the start of the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is married"
This year, the crowning of Miss is not seen on TV in the traditional way, but is shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of the NHL and KHL studios of Viasat and Viaplay.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the trio told the invited guests and media representatives who had arrived.
Initially, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a resounding applause.
Now, all women, shout!
Now look at this male presenter of ours, Sohlberg annealed his colleagues as the audience cheered.
The front row is followed by many Miss Finland of previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in the direction of one of them.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg looked towards Saro.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Siepp, who was laughing at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about his resignation for the first time in the newspaper Ilta-Sanomat.
Missbeautiful says she doesn’t want to open the reasons for the difference in more detail to the public, because it’s a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he is not rushed into a new relationship, he is going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things and especially on living my own life alone,” said Sara Sieppi.
The marriage status of Harjula came up at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The presenter's three-year-old laughs at her.
Ira was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi acknowledged the mistake.
The Northern man tortured his cohabiting partner by cutting, burning and feeding a strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for a number of offences against his common-law spouse.
The crime was committed by means of a belt, a cable and a bundle of ties.
The court sentenced the objects in question to be lost to the state.
He was charged with aggravated rape.
However, this charge was rejected by the District Court.
It was attributed to Kokkola four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of harm.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last act, the man was arrested and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia issued its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in the prison in Vaasa.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-olds were also accused of two aggravated deprivation of liberty and rape on May 22.
However, these charges were rejected by the court as unproven.
The case was dealt with behind closed doors.
However, the District Court issued a public statement of the judgment.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted his spouse with violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked tobacco, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of this.
In its judgment, the court ordered the loss of criminal equipment: a belt and cable, bundle ties, a robe belt, a knife and a vesur.
Four witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together.
The resolution reads that a large part of the most serious acts took place at the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old victim must pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, aches, suffering and temporary harm.
He hardly has that money, for the sentenced person already has an old debt in debt collection.
The prison sentence is not the first for a man.
The evening newspaper does not state the name of the convicted person in order to protect the privacy of the victim.
A recent district judgment is not final at the time of writing.
Europe leads four-point Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golfers reinstated their leadership in a traditional punching match against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup around Paris with a score of 10-6, while the twelve singles played on Sunday are still ahead.
Europe won three out of four Saturday's four-ball matches, and the afternoon's four-game won 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches as a couple on Friday and Saturday.
Previously, none of the European couples had achieved this.
On Sunday, the duo will be looking for more history.
No European player has won five points in one of the Ryder Cups, and only three Americans have won either: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence is not a part of football"
The football betting league team HJK published a statement on Sunday condemning its supporters’ behaviour in the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
We regret the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the press release states.
At the end of the match, around 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge Honga’s supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The orderly men were not able to calm the situation, but needed police officers and also horse police officers.
HJK says in a press release that the team’s players and staff are shocked by what has happened.
Events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
We are strongly dissociating ourselves from any action that threatens the security of the matches," the press release states.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organisers to investigate the factors that pose a threat to safety and to eliminate mild phenomena.
Supporter culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
In every way, we support positive, happy and encouraging activities in football clubs.
Violence is not part of it," the press release says.
Philippine inventor flies a drone car - to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some Pelle Peloton.
He is now a member of a growing number of people in the world who swear that he has invented a flying car - or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from around the world, a man has spent a large part of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
He recently said he had made his first successful test flight - he was flying on his device at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will provoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago," Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates that tomorrow’s industrial action will be visible in children’s day care and social and health care services
The bans on overtime and shift shifts in public and welfare sectors will start tomorrow, especially in social and health services and in child day care, says JHL’s President Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be reflected in the way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how to apply for a child.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services are playing and that no one’s life is under threat,” says Niemi-Laine to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the number of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shifts due to contract negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for employees not to be hired, but to remain in overtime or change shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
It is the norm in occupational safety and health that regular working hours are taken care of and only done for each employee.
JHL opposes the government's intention to reduce redundancy protection for small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, Director of the Labour Market for Municipal Employers, does not take a pre-assessment of the effects of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although the services may deteriorate.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have prepared what needs to be done.
The area is such an impossibly large, social and health care sector and the technical sector that it is hard to say.
The effects can vary greatly by industry, region and employer," Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that the experience gained last week included the work of the Association of Local and Basic Care Professionals Super and the Health and Social Services Federation Tehy, which has lasted for three days.
Their effects were quite minor.
JHL’s ban on overtime and shift-shifting applies to municipal, church, state and private social and health workers, among others.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial struggle affects almost 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Act on the Termination of Workers continues.
The government should now admit that we are running into the wall and hard.
Jalonen believes that both the trade union movement and the government must meet.
It is special that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the presentation has not yet been given, Jalonen says.
The great coral reef is created by children and adults - the gyms of the performance study the gestures of ray and seahorse
The Great Coral Reef of the In Other Spaces collective premiered last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanteltalo.
Like the group’s previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer presentation is also being built, which refreshes and crystallises the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is also a fairytale magic for children in theatre play.
The child’s point of view has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the great coral reef is not a children’s performance, but a performance that adults and children collaborate on.
It provides adults with information and observations on how children receive information and make art.
Children’s ability to indulge in exercises and common games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The great coral reef is somewhat reminiscent of a fairy tale ballet, a fitness circuit and a nature-themed information tour, but it is finally tuned around visits in different, non-human settings.
The great coral reef begins with the study of the trajectories of corals and organisms and fish living on the coral reef.
In six different exercise areas, you will learn, among other things, the gestures of a ray and a seahorse.
Finally, a less than an hour-long performance will be performed, where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you discover the life of the coral reef.
In the great coral reef there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef as well as the corals that are viewed.
In addition, there are organisms that look at corals.
Views and observations in many directions make the performance dense and life-changing.
Whether it be a landscape of an organism, an organism that looks at the landscape, or another organism that looks at the organism, or a landscape - and all this at the same time.
It doesn’t seem difficult for children.
In other spaces, the group strives to train to the limit of thinking and action, to which catching up when the group is made up of both children and adults, is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration will be held at Sitratori on behalf of endangered corals.
Devastation beyond human comprehension should not be allowed to harden, although it might be difficult to understand the significance of exercising one’s own compassion in the face of visions of destruction.
In other spaces, the work has been built in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also by means of a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousnesses, other species and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it will clear up space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad my childhood didn't have smartphones
Today's children and young people are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do so.
I was shocked when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister from the "boyfriend" at the weekend.
When she came to pick up her drunken sister, she told her about her sex experiences that night.
I could not possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs should not be touched and sex is an adult affair.
I hope that today’s children could live a decent childhood, and they don’t have to grow up too early because of group pressure created by friends.
I constantly see younger girls on Instagram who are wearing make-up and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used in the evening to take and send revealing images.
It is even harder for girls to guess what age they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad my childhood didn't have any smartphones.
I was a child for many years, and I didn’t have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: The authorities told the state leadership that Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Yle, the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Defence Forces visited to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that Airiston Helme’s investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime,” says Yle.
Information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered to be financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else here," Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle’s data, no evidence of a connection to national security has been found so far, but the investigation is only just beginning.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed from there, says one of Yle’s interviewees.
A week ago, extensive home searches started in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is merely about financial crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, the tabloid compiled a story that goes through allegations, both for and against.
Video: Dream Goal Saves Liverpool's Lost Series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team for a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and went on a 1-0 guest victory.
The combination of Pep Guardiola then sent a signal to the whole Premier League that the City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to dominate his own field head.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a Wednesday’s great league cup away from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard got up from the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard has been involved since the early minutes.
In the 25th minute he first played in a small space with the three-game Mateo Kovacic and Jorgenho.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty zone, but bombarded the rear corner of the complete left leg bet.
Pool's brass guard Alisson was a little slow in his fight and did not get like his fingertip on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt that the loss position was lightly unfair, because almost immediately afterward Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah from the goal line.
In the second period, Chelsea-veski Kepa also got into action.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to the Sario Mané bet and pushed the ball from the foot of the pole into a corner kick.
At the other end of the line, Alisson resets his surrender to Hazard's passing.
The best place for guests came in the 72nd minute, when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the brass star's bump was directed towards teammate David Luiz, who saved the masters' lead.
It didn't last for the 89th minute, either, when the replacement Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it at the top of an irresistible bet.
Liverpool's 100% league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it is still at the top of the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also heavily involved in the championship with two points behind the top.
In the clock shift debate, the poteroes are deep
I remember a few decades ago, when a newspaper asked about different Finnish influences, which divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer was the only one left to mind: the Nen ending.
Some have a nen-terminal in their last name and some do not.
It is possible to create dividing lines anywhere, and here was one offer.
In the EU, Finland has led to the abandonment of the annual clock shift.
Very many agree that the movement of watches twice a year has been the work of fools and caused many problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing is now to decide what time you will eventually end up in: in the current summer or winter time, or in some other time zone.
The people can also say their opinions on this on the otakanta.fi website.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open on Friday 12 October.
There is a heated debate on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on people’s well-being and summer time with the effect of evening light on people’s outdoor activities and thus well-being.
Both positions have solid supporters and good arguments.
Studies have also shown that morning light rhythms the day and gives refreshment.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, increase the lightness of people’s movement outdoors and give better opportunities for, for example, autumn gardening.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated for his class.
I'd rather take both, but bad for our location in the North of the Earth we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
A typical feature of the discussion on the subject is that one’s own view is being driven and the other’s view is being strongly opposed.
The opponent’s arguments are hardly heard, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on this, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.
It burns with powder.
The subject is very easy to debate, because the matter does not require much attention and a mutu-feel is enough to justify it.
Similar issues are usually the most controversial and equally infertile.
It will be a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but it will not be adapted.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels sober.
Josba fought for a close guest victory
Josba's first guest game in Floorball Divar produced a full three points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a triumph of 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1).
Nurmo was still in the lead at the beginning of the third round, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5-win goal.
Both teams played decisive minutes on the equator.
Josba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was also firepower when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) were also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of the birth of her goal.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
The next step is to visit O2-Jyvaskyla in two weeks.
200th Anniversary of the Eno Church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated on Sunday in a very sad atmosphere.
A week ago, the arson of the church in the escalation danger was a shock.
The church was also guarded the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place for celebration.
Even if no one wants to do so, the Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been Eno’s heart, despite the municipal and other connections of all the world.
The family fair begins today at 10 a.m. at Eno Church.
Then we move to the parish house next to a Karelian dinner table.
The programme has all kinds of things both indoors and outdoors throughout the day.
For example, you can visit the church building under the guidance of the retired, 37-year-old Ari Räsänen.
The celebration of the birth of the church also marks the end of one era.
The church building, which was built in 1982, has been decommissioned for the last time today.
We are now in a evacuee room at the former municipal hall," says chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by indoor problems, but the church has been in a healthy place for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from the position of Chairman of the Board of Tesla - $40 million agreed on fraud charges
Electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have settled their case with the SEC, the US Securities Markets Authority.
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being ousted as a result of the company he founded.
Musk will, however, continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk is forced to retire from the position of Chairman of the Board of Tesla for three years.
The company will have to hire an external board chairman.
Musk is also subject to tighter controls.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent directors and monitor Musk's communications more closely.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
The decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and disadvantages for Tesla shareholders," said Steven Peikin, Director of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's financing is secured.
The twilight momentarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the deal with the company’s other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it would demand that Musk be fined and banned from running listed companies.
The challenge of the SEC frightened investors, and Tesla's share went down sharply.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to AFP, the country’s disaster agency.
The number of deaths is expected to continue to increase, as the investigation of the damage is ongoing.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could reach thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised a tsunami that hit the town of Palu on Sulawesi Island.
Immediately after the earthquake, a warning was issued about the tsunami, which was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead are at least until now Palus.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Requests for assistance from Ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Jo Widodon, who arrived at the disaster area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue efforts without exhausting day and night.
One of the focal points of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are still believed to be in ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the Rescue Department, said that the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, which is popular for business travellers, were excavated by one person at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy equipment for clearing would be needed quickly in the earthquake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help, you on return and nearby.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one author appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in the UK
Many British politicians were harassed when their contacts leaked due to the lack of encryption in the app.
The troublemakers were able to access, for example, the telephone numbers of the ministers.
It was an application used at the Conservative Party Party in the UK.
For example, Michael Gove, the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were the targets of harassment.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the application, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians who were in the mobile application of the Conservative Party’s annual meeting.
The public had access to profiles using a politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
The person who logged in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile photo to a pornographic photo and title.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by saying that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people’s profiles with their email addresses.
You can then view the profile person's contact information and send messages in their name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative Party spokesperson apologised for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The ICO supports the data leak.
The application was developed by Crown Comms, an Australian company.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week there are a large number of Polish people to be killed in The Wall Finland quiz.
Close-eyed viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Finland.
The fast-growing US format The Wall landed as a Finnish version to Nelonen last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for filming were exceptional, as the large 12 meter high wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, a studio audience of the programme was highlighted on social media, and the audience was drawn into Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate as to whether the Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game played in Finnish.
Neonen’s head of domestic programmes, Unne Sormunen, sheds light on the issue in the evening newspaper.
He says that the studio audience includes close players, other Finns living in Poland, and just Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who take part in the descriptions of different programmes, Sormunen explains.
He points out that it is not so difficult to follow the game itself, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green falling balls are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters present in the studio for foreign-language speakers who will take care of the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneous interpreting for a studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap to throw there, for example, and what is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was recently delivered in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff took part in Talent Finland’s filming in Finland.
He had a simultaneous interpretation in his ear all the time, and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the descriptions, Sormunen summarises.
The typhoon in the south of Japan is heading towards the main islands - authorities warn of landslides and floods
The authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
The typhoon in Tram has injured at least 50 people, but the authorities say that major injuries have been avoided and there is currently no information on the deaths.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned the cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters and electricity has been cut off from more than 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are in some places stalled due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around half a day in Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there will also be strong winds and rains.
Trains have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to meteorologists, Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The ace's sky grew darker and darker
The beginning of the aces has been a bad one.
The sky was almost black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Porins now have five consecutive losses and a total of two points per six rounds.
None of the defenders of the Aces or the players of the two lower chains have scored yet.
Pressure is also increasing all the time.
The public broke out of the hall against Sport when almost half of the game was left.
Six games have just been played, and there is no reason to give up here.
Of course, we have to be concerned, because we played so poorly.
Especially the presentation of the second batch was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki told Äss.
Of course, it tasted like a victory for the sport.
The team had a game on Friday, so it would have been visible.
Maybe it did, but the Aces could not make use of it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, wonders at the number of audiences in the grand hall.
Somehow I thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyväri thinks in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Tractor Plow Championships were held at the same time as the Bread Day, so perhaps it would be expected that the number of audiences could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it turned out differently; the corridors were clogged before ten o’clock, the sellers reported that the products were out of stock, the news porridge was sold at almost 500 times more than before, and the number of cars Hyväri heard was rising.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6000, Hyväri says later this afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon, there was a lot of room for families with children, which might have attracted them a lot.
In addition, Hyväri estimates that the event will reach even further.
Salespeople also turn to Liper every year for a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred presenters, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the bread keeper.
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyväri, admired the audience at the auditorium.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children’s series, Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won a public vote.
11 different types of bread arrived at the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in the pie shop of the marts.
7 x The most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without tireing.
It is worth investing in good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux’s Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a service to your eyes
The importance of lighting increases, the more years there are behind it.
Sufficient light can help with problems that many will experience with age, as visual acuity decreases and glare becomes more and more painful.
The need for light also increases for parents.
A 60-year-old needs light three times more than a 20-year-old.
Therefore, for health reasons, it is worth investing in the healing effects of the light and the properties of the light.
A good light gives enough light, but not dazzling,” Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
At the moment, the decorator can afford to choose.
The popularity has a Japanese style that combines gesture-free Scandinavianism and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style of the 70s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colours, has also become a boom.
Authenticity is fascinated in the same way as in other interiors of the home.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express your personality
On the other hand, there is now more emphasis on home than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, we want a tailor-made, even bold, light fixture with a story to tell.
People are clearly searching for Finnish and Nordic products, the origin and design of which are known.
So let’s be very design-conscious,” Jokiniemi says.
Home is not necessarily the latest trend lamp, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
A certain kind of timeless, jewellery-like and elegant classics are held up year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian striker after three games
The roads of Kookoko and Brendan O'Donnell diverge.
The Canadian attacker played three league matches without power points in orange black, KooKoo says in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a probationary period until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played at KHL in the ranks of Kunlund Red Star and at KHL’s farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There is no information about O'Donnell's new club yet.
Gamer wants to set an example in recycling - goods leave the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
In addition to games, Pelimies also recycles packaging materials.
The products of the brick-and-mortar shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from an online store are packed in packaging from importers, for example.
All packages that come to us go for re-use.
We may use the boxes a dozen times as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula of the Gamer of Oulu.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
The bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are also planning to move to recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an additional problem.
There is no big problem starting to recycle.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is used again.
Recycling is a natural fit for the Gamingman’s activities, as in addition to new products, the main product range of the shop includes the games and equipment used.
Buying every fashion conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in any outfit.
With their versatility, they create a good gardenerob base, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics at a low cost.
In the autumn, the most used classics of the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
Black knitwear made of natural material with polo collars cannot have a faulty purchase.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, tulle skirts and jeans, and you can create both a restrained outfit and a stunner-like style around it.
The polone knit is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create your style.
Autumn trend look is born of golden brown and wide leg corduroy trousers, black polo knitwear and grey ankle boots.
The classic polo knit together with other classics, the blue-green scotch skirt and the burgundy loafers form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring an edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casually trendy pieces of clothing: a jeans skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Youthful and elegant!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU have renounced this practice.
During the Soviet period, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabbatical activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The Soviet security service KGB's agents in the West have prepared detailed plans for important targets, says Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004), who defected to the West of the KGB.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired DRGs for Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers uniforms and accessories for cover operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, set up checkpoints from the peninsula to the roads leading to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their mother country.
During the Cold War, agents hid equipment packages containing mines, explosives, lighters and media for sabotage groups in the terrain.
As late as 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, whose trappings exploded when it was sprayed with a water cannon by the authorities.
Police reached four drunk drivers in the province at night
The police caught four drunk drivers in different parts of North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti breathed 1.57 per mil.
He drove half past four at night at the beginning of Kajaanintie with two passengers.
At 4 a.m., the car sank into the ditch on the Kurevaara road of Polvijärvi, and a 19-year-old local man who was alone in the car blew 1.54 per mil according to the police.
There were no serious injuries to him in the run-out.
A 20-year-old man driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokumpu breathed 1.33 per mil.
The police also suspect that the drivers involved were drunk driving and that the driver of Polvijärvi was in danger of endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning, a 36-year-old man carrying a local van at the intersection of Öllöntie and Hoikantie in Tuupovaara breathed 0.52 per mil.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
The police are asking for observations of the stumbling at the Turku railway station after midnight.
According to the police, the man was assaulted in the parking lot in front of the station with fatal consequences.
The action was recorded on the surveillance camera.
The suspects, dressed in dark trousers and brown or beige jackets, immediately left Ratapihankatu in the direction of the bus station.
One suspect left Humalistonkatu by bicycle in the direction of the city centre.
Pedestrian died after being under a bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early on Saturday morning after a bus hit him.
The accident occurred after 4 a.m. on Raumantie at Niittya.
The driver of the bus is not suspected of a crime.
The police investigate the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Risk in line for the rest of the period, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, Sports Director at HPK in Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (centrally) has been important to the team in terms of start-ups, under-power play and the defensive role of the quarterfield.
During the probationary period, Philip Riska will continue at the HPK in Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of the 33-year-old Riska in the roles offered to him was assured by the club management.
Filip has been an important piece of work for us when it comes to start-ups, under-power play and the defensive role of the fourth stage.
Even though there is still room for improvement, it is a good idea for the young team to stick to such an experienced player," says HPK Sports Director Mika Toivola in the club's press release.
According to Toivola, the value of Risk increases when playing the league’s solution games.
Riska, a central striker from Pietarsaari, has previously played league hockey in JYP, Lock and Sport.
Instead, the striker Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the trial period.
The real story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experience.
The film of the evening is based on them.
Everest is now premiered on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur’s guidance for 2015 is about a survival struggle that has been dealt with in a grainy way.
The tragedy has been made into films - and documents - in the past.
The real events are also discussed in this case.
22 years ago, the highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was the guide to Weathers.
Weathers’ life could be saved by an eye surgery carried out before leaving Nepal.
As a result of this and the air pressure, he lost sight, which is why the conquest of the peak had to be omitted.
Rob Hall continued his journey and did not return.
Weathers’ struggle for life and death had just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and no longer found his way back to the camp.
When they came to find a man, they found him in such a bad condition that they did not believe in survival.
Weathers were left to die.
However, as if by a miracle he still got on his feet and found others.
Weathers were still thought to be dying and was once again left to their own fortunes.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellowclimbers began to believe the possibility of giving him help.
Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
The 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated today
Eno’s 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and a celebration of the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The celebrations began at 10 a.m. at the family fair on the Eno church hill, after which Karelian table offerings have been offered at the Eno parish hall.
The church was full.
517 people attended the family fair.
Eno's vicar, Armi Rautavuori, was delighted that so many people had come to the church.
It is a great pleasure for a long time and gives strength to the work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
The fire of the church in the escalation danger has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno church.
The Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Joensuu, after the church of Kiihtelysvaara was destroyed in the fire.
The church was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotion was held at the risk of embarrassment, in which the church, which had been destroyed by fire, was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: The median flashed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm surged from southwest to Greece on Saturday.
The medieval hurricane, the medic, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete regions.
The images taken from the area show a large number of floods all over Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the Korinthia region instead of the street due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been flooded.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused strong seas.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The Embassy invites you to follow weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The medieval hurricane, the medic, brings with it heavy rains and even the risk of flooding.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medicans appear only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The current storm left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey northwards and towards Europe.
Concerns in Greece have also been raised about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to decent shelter.
In the summer, areas destroyed by wildfires remain under the storm in the surroundings of Athens.
The medic was also raging in Greece last November.
You should not go to the sea now, flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are on holiday in the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm.
The trips to the sea are cancelled, and even when walking, it is advisable to be careful that no branches or other bulk fly over the storm.
These guidelines have been shared by guides for over 3 500 Finns on a holiday in Greece via solar trips during the weekend.
Instructions are needed, as even the horrific Zorbas storm has been predicted to be beating the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, the wind speed can rise in gusts up to 45 meters per second.
Weather wretchedness is caused by heavy rains.
All those who have travelled to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland, who have given their phone numbers, have been warned about the strong winds by SMS, according to tour operators.
In the air, however, sun and heat
According to Inka Ikonen, a communications specialist for solar trips, the worst has been avoided by the beginning of Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we keep an eye on the situation all the time.
Safety is ahead of us.
The media officer Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our on-site staff.
At least Crete was still peaceful, he told me on Saturday early evening.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of over 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is likely to occur on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon in Rhodes, there had been a drop in the sun, and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees, says Ikonen.
Zorbas is expected to become the next Turkish nuisance, albeit slightly lessened.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya, for example," says Schroderus.
With Shirly Karvinen and Janni Huss, perfectly identical evening gowns in the Miss Final - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says she got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found a great suit for me this evening, Hussi smiles.
The same silver evening dress was also chosen by host Shirly Karvinen.
The two also noticed similar outfits and looked at the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat that he was in a hurry in the preparations, and he had to get ready on the plane.
Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet presenter in the Miss Final, and he talks about the front-line stars arriving at the scene.
Hussi has a recent move behind him, as he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday.
I am going to stay there for now, let's see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own study room, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi went on holiday alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only at the hotel for a week without leaving.
When the stress broke out, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvinen's behaviour on the plane attracted a lot of attention - gathered the curious eyes of pensioners
The host and 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen told the Miss Finland final on the red carpet that she had enough to do with the radio coverage and the Love Island Finland filming.
There has been enough haste for Karvinen to reach the final straight from Finnair’s flight.
I did make-up and put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamor.
Changing the evening dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says that she has brought out her make-up in the middle of pensioners.
His visit also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My make-up was amusing, at least for others.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says she has enjoyed her job as a host of Love Island Finland.
He also describes his experience as stopping so far.
Karvinen says he had been to the show on Friday to say hi to the singles.
It's really raw in some way.
They are genuine feelings of people, Karvinen describes the feelings of singles in the program.
How do I wear over-knee boots?
Three perfect examples
Classic clothes are pieces of clothing that work from season to season in any outfit.
The classics are often decades old, but sometimes even the most modern individuals can be accommodated.
A few years ago, the over-knee boots, which became a hit shoe for the autumn and winter season, have not gone away.
As its name suggests, boots that reach the knee are recurring in style year after year and season after season.
The showy boots share the opinions of the users, but it is worth trying a bold model, well - boldly.
Over-knee boots are really suitable for any outfit.
Whether it is jeans, laces, tulle or tights, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots works.
The long boots look good both in the festive look and everyday outfits.
The black over-knee boots are perfect for even the softest outfits.
They suitably balance the feminineness of a pink, flowery plier skirt and a soft, voluminous knit.
A fresh, yet autumnal, stylish everyday outfit for romantic tastes.
A strong and slightly retro outfit is created from a long copper-brown velvet dress, overknee boots, spectacular earrings and a rivet bag.
Although the over-knee boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday wear together with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
It's wonderfully easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
The robot cars of Otaniemi will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area will start traffic on a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical performance of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robotic cars are doing with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real-life environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robot cars are fully automated with other traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
A passenger on board is always responsible for vehicle safety.
The vehicles constantly sense their surroundings with several sensors and assess whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the observed obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, who is responsible for the development of robotic transport.
Robot cars run all autumn three days a week: Tuesdays at 13-15.30, Wednesdays at 10-15 and Thursdays at 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers by car.
Stops on robot cars are identified by stop markings.
The most secure way to get on board is from Otakaari stop number 1.

Police supervise hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Police Department of Eastern Finland carried out hunting supervision on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the Police Department’s batch liaison officers reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the supervision was on the legality and legality of hunting.
A hunting card was checked for each hunter and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, the permits for the possession of hunting weapons and the quantities of self-loading weapons used in the henchmen were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 days for unauthorised hunting.
In addition, 133 drivers were blown up by the police and two of them are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fine procedure, police times.
In summary, hunters follow the hunting license very well.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said, "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone has checked permissions".
The Police Department of Eastern Finland will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other control authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, 530 Syrian refugees have been taken to Finland from Turkish refugee camps.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) first selects particularly vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, the disabled and the sick, women and children.
More people are chosen for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some of them do not arrive for different reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Süleyman Soylu, and the non-governmental organisations on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, will also take part in the trip.
Talk about raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 a year for a couple of years, but the government has not since come to an agreement to raise it.
The National Coalition Party has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has last fallen into opposition to the blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently proposed gradually raising the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
Mykkänen’s visit during this government term is the first that the Minister of the Interior will monitor the selection of quota refugees on the spot.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (Collection) and Paula Risikko (Collection) had time to move on to their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're going wrong - you no longer know if you're crying or laughing
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill amending the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill prohibits, in principle, the keeping of all animals as farm animals, pets or otherwise related to business activities, which are not specifically permitted by government decrees.
In other words, everything else is, in principle, prohibited except for the animals specified in the regulation.
If the bill ends up as a law, it means that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security of society or good manners.
In principle, we are now in the process of introducing a ban on all activities that are not expressly permitted by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business operations and nothing can be done until the law or regulation that approves it has been adopted.
The Government’s activities in the drafting of legislation in general have been weak.
If we go down the road that basically everything in Finland is forbidden, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act would require an update.
But this kind of law project is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept this "everything is forbidden, which is not permitted by law or regulation".
I hope there will be a sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a law project.

Kimi Räikkönen sums up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen was able to admit that Mercedes, the worst competitor, was too hard a piece of time for the Russian GP.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but nothing huge is at stake.
Our car was the best in time all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, a fourth driver and a teammate with Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen, who was clearly behind Mercedes.
Ferrari had a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes.
They seem to go faster than we do - it's as simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, we would probably go at the same pace as them.
But I know no more than anyone else.
This is a constant guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, there was rare delicacy in the future Sauber team of Räikkönen.
Charles Leclerc, who will replace Räikkönen next season with Ferrari, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final qualifying session.
For Swedish drivers, the 10th place of departure is the best in over three years.
And even though in the second driving session, as many as five drivers did not drive at all, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Räikkönen to think of the future?
Yes, if you compare to where they were in the early part of the year, then the step forward has been a big one.
Next year there will be a different story, so let's see, let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart evening progressed steadily.
Germany was a more pro-active party in the ring, but he did not get a good hit.
Clearly more extensive, Helenius controls the match with his hard series, which found their way well.
Finland was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Teper directly to the left.
The hit was so hard that the veteran in front of the home audience did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
He then changed his language to Finnish for a while.
Thank you to all the spectators and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was delighted immediately after the match.
It was a huge victory for Helenius’ career.
It might even be possible to get to the World Cup," Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
The loss, on the other hand, could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course, it has come to mind.
This is not going to get any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the meeting with Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may increase
According to The Guardian, the president of the country calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
The rescuers are looking for the trapped and also the dead from the areas most affected on Sulawesi Island: the port city of Return and its neighbouring municipality Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out of.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
The rescuers say they heard the cries of people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
President of Indonesia, either Widodo, has ordered the army to be rescued and cleared.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, because in disaster areas, electricity and data communications are in many places broken.
Fuel reserves are also depleting.
Miss Finland finalist’s hesitant response and long reflection caused a laugh
A new Miss Finland is currently being selected in Billnäs.
During the interview round, a question was asked to each of the miss-finalists.
The finalists drew the question from the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, hesitated to respond to the sweet but benevolent laughter of the audience present.
The question posed to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book that the Miss Finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good while before he hesitated.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I have read is..., Anttikoski said thinking.
The pause made the audience laugh until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I have read is...
I have read books in school!
I think something related to economics.
So the last book I have read is the economics of someone, Anttikoski replied.
After replying, Anttikoski received a resounding applause from the audience accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the missi tour, Anttikoski attracted attention, because he did not want to pose in the underwear because of his principle.
Miss Finland will be crowned at 21.00 when Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm gives up the crown last year.
Sike's apple pear cake takes your tongue away
This recipe is for you who have good, acidic apples of your own, because the domestic apple is at a shocking price in the store.
You may need to buy a pear, even though a lot of people are already growing it.
This cake can also only be made from apples if you do not want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more varied if the cake is also sprinkled with its pear.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seeds.
Slice.
Melt butter in a saucepan.
Whisk the eggs and sugar into a foam and then add corn flour and melt butter to the foam.
Combine corn starch, i.e. maize and baking powder, and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread casserole with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the casserole and spread the pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough over the pear slices and apple slices over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple slices.
Cook in the oven at 180°C for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Allow to cool in a pan and then turn over to the serving plate.
Cut the cake until it is well cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and crumbles easily because the dough contains almond and corn flour without gluten.
An international crime literature event will be held in Ruka in January

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two types of "coolness" with slightly different characteristics: generally charming coolness and, in part, dissident coolness.
Attractively cool people, according to the researchers, had many socially desirable traits: they were outward-oriented, friendly, harmonious, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebelliousness, and edge.
They were thirsty for experiences and paid little attention to external evaluations.
Both types were associated with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of Kovis is not cool in the long run: a high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the US study published in Child Development in 2014.
Young people who were dating early, partying, looking for good-looking groups, and seeking the popularity of others, had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime.
In their relationships, they did less than their previously unobtrusive peers.
High-status luxury cars, branded bags or watches do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most people were more willing to make friends with a regular branded shirt than with a branded shirt - despite the fact that most people opted for a branded shirt when they visited.
If you are on the Greek holiday islands, beware!
There's a hurricane looming - a weather warning shouts red
During the weekend in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland on average in six months.
Hurricane Zorbas hits Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens will announce it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported in Foreca’s blog.
According to it, the strongest gusts of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the Kuisma storm, which had been beaten in Finland in the first half of the week, was blowing at its loudest at just over 31 metres per second.
According to the blog, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind, but heavy rains.
Over 300 millimeters of water can come in southern Greece during the weekend.
It corresponds to about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize a men's drooling Love Island Finland Anku?
Appears in confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that the beauty Anku, drooled by several men in the Love Island Finland series, also appears on strange YouTube videos released in 2010, as a crafting aunt.
In the videos Anku advises craftsmen, among other things, to prepare an octopus from the old paper rolls.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how you can craft a hedgehog with the right spikes.
Now let's get the Easter grass growing, but let's do it in a slightly surprising way, Anku hints and introduces sawdust, pantyhose and sapwood seeds from which he makes a hedgehog.

Valtteri Bottas shook and burst with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shuddered a little more than ten minutes after his pole position in the Russian gp while he was in front of the media.
A great tour left behind Mercedes star Lewis Hamilton and was, of course, an important criticism even for the Finnish rider who gathered this season.
A nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the round.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit," Bottas explained.
I have only been on the stake once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to pass the Sochi track, so the start is particularly important.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he was going to make a profit tomorrow or whether he was going to get the World Cup title from Hamilton.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I am trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the pile, Bottas piled.
But in the stable we fight for both championships.
Lewis's management at Sebastian Vettel is quite big and the difference between me is very big, so keep it in mind.
Let's see what happens, Bottas added.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of Bottas after the race, and Mercedes team leader Toto Wolff also enjoyed the taste.
Lewis had the intention of winning Valtteri, but he did not succeed in the round of seven.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything up to defeat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff said.
To the question of whether the stables will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly, Wolff answered dodgingly.
We will talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee has won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship series rarely ended.
Never before have the brothers become masters of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done by Erik and Henrik Peterinen, who were in the final rally around Turku and Salo, because Erik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee ensured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race was sealed to him by the Finnish championship in two-wheel drive cars of the SM4 class.
At Honda Civic, the competing Kinnunen and map reader Ville Mäkelä started the Turku competition with moderation, as the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the Finnish championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to give a leveling when some of the additional lights were dropped by another special stage.
There was a blind eye to the third part.
In such a situation, it is not appropriate to squeak.
On Saturday, we only followed the pace of Jussi Tepo in the second series, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
Syrian Foreign Minister demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops are fighting terrorism in Syria, and the war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his speech to the UN, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home.
However, there is no end to the seven-year war.
More than 360 000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a Syrian meeting was planned for October, with the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey in addition to her.
Not quite a Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated for the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of harassment, received exceptionally many people by the squares.
In the United States, a full-fledged Supreme Court judge's nomination drama attracted at least 20 million people to his televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and the Californian professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were before the Senate Legal Committee to tell his story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to them, a number of millions more were followed by online consultation.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported a record year at 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN’s number will rise by more than 10 million, including those who follow via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also got 8.0 million startups.
Digital startups are channel-specific, the TV viewers’ figures come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final figures on Monday, but they will be dizzy anyway.
Few reach 20 million
More than 20 million viewers in the U.S. are usually only able to attend sports matches and major Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
It is certainly a journey to the US's most watched annual program, the US Football League's NFL final match for the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl brought about 103 million people to NBC.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump's first speech to Congress was attended by almost 48 million people and more than 30 million people taking office.
A very important thing
In the United States, the Supreme Court's appointment of a judge is of the utmost importance, as the posts are for life.
Trump was able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the then President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Ronald Ronald Ronald, but he was on many issues a so-called Libra language whose voice could resolve the position of a nine-member court.
She was a supporter of abortion law and sexual minority rights, and in 2015, for example, she decided that same-sex couples were granted marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock in the conservative supremacy of justice for decades.
Children have the right to information from parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their child’s health information in the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's strange.
Of course, the situation with Kanta service was even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health information or recipes of the little ones.
A temporary correction was made in autumn 2016 for persons under the age of 10.
Since then, the practice has been promised to be corrected, but the correction has taken an amazing amount of time.
Now the repair is in place - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a pass-through.
After that, the layman's understanding is all about pressing a button: now that the wire is held, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her details to his or her parents - if he or she has a bank ID or an official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
The ID card is paid, and the 10-year-old does not even get bank IDs.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the information of the fourth grader of the primary school except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much a question of parents’ rights as of children’s rights.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that parents can be involved in it.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where not all things can be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sexual health, of which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the U.S., the FBI began to charge Kavanaugh with harassment.
According to American media, the FBI investigates allegations of harassment by at least two women.
Earlier this week, one of the women was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The survey must not take longer than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation of criminal investigations and it may not become public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The caught brawler continued to bulge even in the chamber.
Police say they have put a man in a police prison to "calm down".
The police were threatened by a suspected abuser on the night of Saturday in Kajaani.
The authorities reported on the incident that began when a 30-year-old man fiercely challenged a dispute in a central restaurant.
The man first abused another customer inside a nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
An outside fighter attacked another man by pouring him into the ground.
When a third party tried to intervene, the man hit him too.
The triple assault led to the call of the police.
The patrol took the man and took him to the police station in Kajaani, the police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
The man kicked the other policeman in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police say they have sent a man to the police prison to "calm down".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition from an official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at UNICEF Finland.
Local authorities are in charge of rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people from the ruins, both survivors and dead.
Rescue operations in Sulawesi are underway in the city of Palu, but the situation in the Donggala area is a little less clear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Assistance measures are difficult, because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings at Sulawesi are often light-weight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter - for example tents at first - and clean water.
In crisis situations, clean water is the most urgent.
The first thing that can be done for most people is to provide the water purification tablets that UNICEF has in stock.
The aim is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, the water is transported to the first emergency, for example, by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and connecting families is one part of UNICEF’s mission.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme, which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, funds previously collected for emergency relief will be used.
However, UNICEF has already started collecting money to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk stops chairing Tesla's board of directors - $20 million fined for tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of space rockets and electric vehicles companies, avoids fraud charges through an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk ends his duties as chairman of the government of the electric vehicle company Tesla and agrees to fines of $20 million.
Musk resigns as part of the agreement he entered into with the US Securities Market Surveillance Authority.
By agreeing on Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with security fraud because of his tweets in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric vehicle company Tesla from the stock exchange, which led to a rapid increase in the company's share price.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" of its Board of Directors and take over two "independent directors" of its Management Team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal fines of $20 million, the Tesla company also has to pay a fine of $20 million to the Financial Supervisory Authority.
Twitter misleads investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to repurchase Tesla from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to billionaire tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420 per share.
Tesla's share price rose by more than ten per cent per day after the tweets, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk's allegations had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his claim for funding.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with any other management team or the company’s board of directors.
On Friday of this week, the rate dropped by 14 per cent, as the SEC reported a fraud case.
It is expected that the company's course will be strengthened again.
The last judgment is not the reason
The bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands are not moving.
This is a technical problem.
The clock in the tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The wise men point at twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: even when the crypt of the church contains exorcism and the organ rings on its own.
Of course this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairer, but some parts have broken and a new part is expected, says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned in the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account.
The account mentions that the last judgment is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church bells are not ringing because of a fault.
