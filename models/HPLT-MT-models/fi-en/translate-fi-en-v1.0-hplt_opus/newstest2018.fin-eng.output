Camille Auer wanted to correct her sex, diagnosed as mentally ill, and now she is making art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the roof of the Art Academy’s Project room.
Each of them says the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell a multi-faceted story of how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Determined for him who he is.
I wanted to share my personal treatment history to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the sex correction process.
It is often a years-long period of research involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to the "gender identity disorder" -diagnosis studies that are being carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he had ordered via the Internet and was already very long in his own repair process.
She felt like a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the repair process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
The Trans-Law, i.e. the Act on the Strengthening of Transgender Sex (563/2002), obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilisation in order to obtain the right gender, for example, in the Population Register Centre and in the passport.
At the moment, every correctionist of his gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive inability.
Man has the right to decide about his own body.
This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," Auer said.
Translating has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations on the law, and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish Government prepared an amendment to the Act under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen.
Elections came and the Finns Party rose to the board.
Now the change in the law is back.
These are domestic disputes that do not even relate to this law.
The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychologist of the Tampere University Hospital’s transpol in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and, on the basis of these, wrote a report that should be defined in order to obtain Auer’s right to care and help.
The subject's sense of reality is exposed to destabilization.
The subject’s perception of the self appears to be fragmented at the border state level, and the unstable characteristics of the personality are highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," Auer says.
There was even greater shock when Auer was not given sex reassignment treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the television in the waiting area of the Transpol.
Later that television was the birthplace of a work called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
It’s crazy that any person who is defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but a diagnosis is needed to remove breasts,” Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are anything other than the amount of your gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only one of its kind.
The process of sex correction is more severe for many mental reasons than purely for medical purposes.
Those who go through it will meet dozens of people who need to be justified by their own existence and their right to their own sex experience.
It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and assistance are denied treatment, claiming that their resources are not enough,” Auer says.
Many of the people who have applied for the process have mental symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
On this basis, medical personnel may order that treatment cannot be started.
Preventing access to treatment and help can put a person in an even worse situation than it was before the start of the process,” Auer says.
Auer’s personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that's what people tend to find difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with drugs and when Auer started using hormones, he felt relieved.
He had finally been able to say the sensations that had already existed in childhood and teenage years.
Why the wide jaw didn't seem to fit into your body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people near him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving,” he says.
Today Auer feels already seen, she exists as a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, random comments from loved ones could have hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people close to you are misrepresented.
They should know and know who I am, but they will not or will not be able to internalize it,” he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, official confirmation of sex cannot be obtained.
There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And that is true.
For example, in Denmark, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination with regard to the legal sex.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code, stating that he/she feels that he/she is of another gender.
After a six-month cooling-off period, the applicant confirms his/her application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right to self-determination is also required in Finland, and this requirement is also reflected in Auer’s exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but it is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.
Camille Auer's exhibition Antiphallic Dick 4.-28.7.2017 at the Academy of Fine Arts' Project Room.
Civil Rights Organization issued a travel warning to Missouri
The NAACP National Agency for African-American Civil Rights has issued a travel warning for Missouri due to discriminatory state practices and racist attacks there.
The NAACP travel bulletin for Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state where a number of questionable racial events have recently taken place," the agency said.
In addition, the implementation of state laws is disproportionately targeted at minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
People's civil rights are violated.
They are stopped by skin color and beaten or killed,” said Rod Chapel, President of NAACP Missouri, to Kansas City Star.
We have not heard one in so many cases before in such a short time.”
The Missouri travel bulletin is the first warning for the United States of America.
The organisation cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. The Missouri police arrested him even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to a statement by the Missouri Attorney General that police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than white.
The purpose of the travel bulletin is to encourage people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,” Chapel says.
People need to prepare, for example, by taking money with them to pay guarantees, or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, the sixteenth largest state in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The Constitutional Civil Rights Organization (ACLU) recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had passed immigration laws obliging the police to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the organization, increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and apply to other states, but recently they have been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO’s supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (centrally responsible for state ownership steering) has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension payment received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the Minister, this is in conflict with the state's statement of intent.
The EUR 130 000 supplementary pension received by Vauramo was raised this week as Helsingin Sanomat reported on the development of the remuneration of the directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The government has stated that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s decision-in-principle on ownership steering.
Sanctions immediately aggravated speech
Until recently, relations between the United States and Russia seemed to be on the way from cold to warm.
In the context of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia seemed to be getting along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled down considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were met with bitter reactions in Russia.
The most outrageous response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who says that the sanctions law signed by Trump means a "full-scale trade war".
Even if Russian reactions were to be acknowledged only as exacerbations and excesses of political rhetoric, the tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after the short-term Trump-selected honeymoon.
In the United States, the implementation of the sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although the Congress passed the law with considerable unanimity, the President said that the adoption of the law was much more difficult.
Trump criticises the recent signing of the law as "significantly lacking".
Russia in particular may have been the reason for President Trump's arrogance, although the adoption of a law that restricts his own powers must also have been repressive.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States into the possible interference of Russia with the presidential elections and the Russian connections to the Trump campaign.
The tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed rapidly and various scandalous turns have almost been revealed to be updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a kimurant one in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union’s core region of the Baltic Sea is also intensifying relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united at least on the face of its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades a lot with Russia, such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent U.S. Sanctions Act are still unclear.
There are fears in the EU that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects can be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of, for example, liquid natural gas (LNG) which is important for the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a way of showing disapproval in world politics.
However, the financial sanctions must be well thought out and rigorous.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now aiming for the Statue of Liberty
Intervening in the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as the rest: together with the American soldiers, the Iraqis fell the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists in the Trump administration, well knew what was going on in a heated debate with Jim Acosta on CNN. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a lexicon on the President's proposal to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not really criticise the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been hit by huge hordes of cruisers and impersonators of the Statue of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the significance of the statue, in particular the addition of a poem by Emma Lazarus to the statue in 1903 – 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller beckoned Acosta: “I don’t want to go into the history of it now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom enlightening the whole world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller was not wrong, but it is not just about history, as he said himself.
The essential words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state calls not only immigrants, but “the poorest of the poor,” are: “Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your doing shore.”
The poem is now more timely than ever.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism; he made it clear that the ‘poorest’ of the poor are not welcome in the United States of Trump.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of the broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, the friends of Lazarus campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue's pedestal. They knew very well that the act was a strong political act.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American republicanism with a classical symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
Linking the poem to the image was an ingenious feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a mouthstacker who can now be seen as a sign of Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is an early pioneer of neoconservatives, who takes the torch of the United States into the darkness-covered world: “Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes the freedom to torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States.”
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The importance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it like the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship's deck after a long and hard journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people seeking protection and a better life.
His statue of freedom is comforted by hope and welcome.
And that is not what Miller and Trump want under any circumstances.
Their torch does not show the way, but instills the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots entered the UK national team
Neil Black, Executive Director of the UK Athletics Federation, says 16 members of the World Cup team are “significant confirmation”.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, something special is happening in Scotland that British athletics must learn from.
This is welcome, and we will continue to investigate it for so long that we understand what it is all about,” Black says.
I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sports and they thought it was related to the Institute’s activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation, on the other hand, believes that it is related to the activities of the Association,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that their actions are behind it.
And an ordinary street rider thinks he must have something to do with it.
However, it’s a great thing, and that’s why.”
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5 000-meter run, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the captain of the national team.
Eilidh is too modest.
His captain’s speech was incredible,” Black says.
Athletes were proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh’s words had a genuine feeling and passion for sport.”
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist in the 400-meter fencing of the Commonwealth Championships, and these are his fifth World Cup. He thinks it’s “incredible” that there are 16 Scottish in the national team.
The previous record was seven in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records during the year.
He competes in London with 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O’Hare runs 1 500 metres in London, and is also worth keeping an eye on: the man has an excellent season behind him, including the victories at the British World Cup and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, with Lee McConnell as the only scotch in the team.
The captain of the national team says that he is “extremely proud” of the fact that there are so many Scottish players involved, some of whom are genuinely competing for finals and medals.
Being a captain is a great honour anyway, but it’s even more special because the members of the team voted for the captain,” Doyle says.
Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who got into the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are among the distinguished athletes who compete for the prize.
My Captain's speech?
I think it went well.
I focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere is going to be amazing.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't stand for public office if you can't stand criticism
Our country’s father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for all possible domestic policies, all the way to his political principles.
Criticism certainly annoyed me,
But he did not silence his critics.
If freedom of speech is lifted, we may be led as stupid and silent as sheep for slaughter,” Washington said in 1783.
That’s where we get to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
The U.S. Civil Rights League sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff find the challenge untrue, and the attitude was downplayed online as well.
What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a democratic state.
He has been ranked second among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to hot weather.
He has led the state firmly and strictly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main communication channel for his voters and published a picture of a bald head in chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary and even dangerous to block users who enter the governor's Facebook page. The governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax money.
Hogan spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy.
Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their chosen leaders, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, pastors, etc.
They said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and relevant.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith in Hogan.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of the Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
I am politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in the Washington Post’s comments.
I also find it unacceptable that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately regarded as an organized group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.
The governor’s staff called the comments a “central attack”; someone else could call them a promotion of what was considered important.
In a Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by blocking a reviewer or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But it really is the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was made last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheris, a judge at the Alexandria District Court, the Loudoun County government violated the first addition to the US Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights League met with the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
At the time of Washington, cheap postage had a similar effect to what is now available on the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymized Washington.
There were trolls at that time.
Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers in which they denounced Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, the US-UK Cooperation, Trade and Shipping Agreement, as evidenced by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, and in addition to online notifications of a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also from individual Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Marja Isomursu, Senior Researcher at Evira.
Greenfinches have died of a parasitic disease called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit pigeons, especially the pigeon.
In the 2000s, however, the disease was also observed in finches.
2009 was a good year.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish greenfinch population, after which the strains of the species have been recovering.
There have now been sick green finches, but at least not yet on a large scale,” says Juha Honkala, museum master at the University of Helsinki’s Natural Science Museum (Luomus).
It can be feared that the previous epidemic of green finches will come back again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop feeding birds for the summer immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home base advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European top player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a homeland advantage for the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open is held at Renaissance Club East Lothian.
Last year, Northern Ireland’s Rafferty led a tournament on Archerfield Links in the neighbourhood before the last round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is in love with the new venue and acts as an ambassador for the club’s founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvad.
I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full glory,” Rafferty says.
The players can see the field at its best. It is in great condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an avid ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field.”
The Englishman, Eales, defends the title for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
This feels like a very special opportunity,” says the player who lives in Southport.
I could not stand up for my Extremadura Open win because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to me: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil and embarks on a tour after turning 50 this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
Playing in the home region is always more important than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again and played quite a lot.
I am happy with my game so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots are participating: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrence, Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

The barracks were investigated for possible indoor air problems
At least so far, indoor air problems have not been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade’s communications company in Säkylä, the brigade was told on Thursday.
Indoor air studies will continue.
The investigations began when a man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought that his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems with the health of other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an individual case and that the other servants in that unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
The brigade's announcement states that due to the arrival of July, goods had to be transferred to barracks, which may have caused a temporary increase in dustiness.
The air may have seemed stale, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's Gold Country
Bardina Degei does not use stoves in cooking.
He also rarely uses the pot.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the restless province of Papua, Indonesia. When he cooks dinner, he usually puts sweet potatoes – locally “nota” – directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the burnt sweet potato is eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei has no furniture in his home. He sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually also takes care of his daily chores, such as laundry in the cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
The office of the toilet is supplied by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been assigned fields to care for her.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and soldiers must also be taken into account.
Nobody dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,” Degei says.
This is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1 026 village elders were forced to vote in public in front of the occupying forces.
The Dutch local independence movement quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which strictly controls the region and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and sluggish. The journey starts with a one and a half hour flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a stomach-wringing five hour drive by rental car.
There is no public transport here.
Around 19 000 people in the city have wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, the corrugated roofs of which have been stained with yellowish-brown rust.
Few Indonesians have come here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribe worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have also taken place.
We didn’t have such clothes,” Degei says. He means his colourful, hand-woven wrap-around headdress, dark skirt and bright-colored blouse.
In the past, we only had leaves as a blanket for our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also a golden land of Indonesia.
Paniai is about the size of New Jersey with 153 000 inhabitants. Only about a hundred kilometres from Paniai is Grasberg, the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine provided Freeport with $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
However, for the Papuans, these wealth brings misery, as it means a suffocating presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and military local units between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers paid up to $150 000.
Papua's demands for greater autonomy threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass murders in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s took place in proportion to the proportions of genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3 900 people in the area during peaceful protests.
In the 2016 report of the Archdiocese of Brisbane, We Will Lose Everything, there are reports of the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular – and relentless attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are weekly cases,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as the natural resources of Papua attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi move into the region in the hope of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Warung food stalls in Java sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mix in peanut sauce.
It is difficult for locals to compete.
Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the marketplace cheaper than locals,” says 24-year-old Abeth You, who came from Pania and moved to the provincial capital after work.
Local women lost their customers.
Indonesian President Jo Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to address the injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 districts, and this former carpenter won a vote in 27 districts, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel deceived.
Our hearts were broken because we voted for Joow in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice,” You says.
Panias experienced some kind of wave base only two months after the official inauguration of Jowi in October.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by the fire in Enarotal on 7.12.2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to reports of victims and witnesses, the drunken soldiers captured the children and beat them with a hack at the rifles.
One of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A couple of hours later, the building of the State Electoral Commission near the venue was set on fire, and the next day it started to happen.
Around a thousand Papuans – young men and women and children – gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They had hunting bows for celebrations, and they began performing the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they danced in a ring and imitated bird song.
Some demonstrators began to stone the police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers were told in the internal radio system: “If the crowds are resisting more than three times, shoot them to death.” The information is based on an official document seen by TIME, which has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a resident leader of the Kego Koto district, thought the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
When I turned around, I was put on my left wrist,” he told TIME on the veranda of his brightly coloured wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
Several shots were fired in the crowd.
Alfius Youwia was shot three times. His cousin saw the shootings.
I ran to him and made sure it was really him,” Yohanes told TIME sadly. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were just “protecting” the police station because it was under attack.
We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Pudjo Sulistiy, a spokesman for the Papua Police Department, said in 2015.
It is about life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
Information about the killings was carried to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the violence in Papua.
I want the case to be investigated immediately so that nothing like that ever happens again.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch investigations into human rights violations outside the judicial system.
However, he immediately began to withdraw his speeches.
Most of the violations took place a long time ago,
1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but certain processes are needed,” he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5.6.2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he did not intend to start studies in Papua.
Everything will be settled in court,” he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". The crimes relate to the death of more than a thousand people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events of Paniai.
The families of the victims of Panai are grim disbelief in the claims.
I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way,” Yohanes says.
I’m tired of this already.”
He says he still lives in fear, even though it has been years since then.
I'm afraid," he says.
I'm afraid the army will arrest me. I'm afraid I'll be shot.
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians dare not discuss the incident.
He says the soldiers had abused him when he had helped to bury four of the victims.
The soldiers are looking for me after the victims are buried,” he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring area of Paniai, Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the director of the construction company, which began when the director refused to take a man who had lost consciousness to the hospital.
The man who needed hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in the water while fishing on the nearby river, and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned the policemen who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, the Indonesian semi-military police unit opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
We are horrified. We are afraid of revenge,” says 29-year-old Domingogu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
I’ve been hiding at home for two days.
Deiyai Parliament has called for the shootings of police officers responsible and the withdrawal of the mobile police unit from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the verdant middle highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans through random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM’s leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the uprising by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of ‘security of national sovereignty’.
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as a “sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and it is too expensive for locals, too.
Just like bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10 000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in local and migrant livelihoods have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they tend to go to better educated and more wealthy locals.
Few Papuans have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
Young people don’t want to stay because there is no work or money here,” said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The remote Papua is getting little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare permission to shoot.
According to the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kine, Jokowi has not kept his election promises and has neither increased transparency nor promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
Reporters from the most turbulent eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua, are facing new risks: refusal of a visa and blacklisting,” Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that only the immediate neighbours of Papua are under pressure from the Indonesian government.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s “severe and widespread violations,” including the Paniai shooting attack.
These countries have traditionally supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations”.
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the Dutch delegation led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says an anonymous source who participated in the meeting.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say that they are no longer likely to vote for Joow.
Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who have been involved in the Paniai shooting,” said Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panic people: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in poverty and poverty, practically without health services and educational facilities.
According to Gobai, the Panians, like the rest of the Papuans, regard the votes they give to Jocow as a “debt” that must be repaid.
They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the intimidation and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again showed a symbolic opposition: they buried one of the victims in a country opposite the police station and the military headquarters.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
My family member was killed,” Yacobus says in the head.
What else can we do?
Dereck Chisora barks at Robert Helenius' cancellation of the rematch: "Not even their own fans want to see"
The heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at the Hartwall Arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora casts the blame for the re-run of the match on the shoulders of Helenius.
My match in Finland was flop, but it was not my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora blunts.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial point verdict.
The ticket sales for the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter, Nisse Sauerland, told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match had been postponed to the autumn.
There has never been anything new about the match since.
However, the cancellation no longer bothers Chisora.
In any case, the match would probably have had to be cancelled after Chisora's illness.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up to a lot of pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora says.
The UK says it is currently in about 45% condition.
He is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December.
Fire reclaimed the Torch skyscraper in Dubai
The flames took over one of the highest residential buildings in the world in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
This was already the second fire in two years in a building whose name happens to be Torch.
The building was emptied and no one was known to have been injured. There was no idea of the cause of the fire immediately after the incident.
We were sleeping and woke up to the sound of a fire alarm and people's cries.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue Department, the firefighters were able to extinguish the fire at 4 a.m. in the morning and stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who have left their homes.
The case may raise questions again about the safety of materials used on high-rise buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch building’s board commissioned a study that found that the most damage was caused by panels used for facade cladding and insulation.
In the UK, the police believe that the insulation and cladding boards of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid progression of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between Tuesday 21st and Wednesday 5th.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was made by Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in colour and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.
The police will request observations of the moped or its aft by e-mail to This e-mail address is protected from spambots.

More than 20% of air passengers in the United States take prohibited items on board, reveals survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of US passengers had deliberately or unknowingly taken prohibited items onto planes past the US Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least 6 percent of passengers had knives or other items with a blade that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they only learned afterwards that they had carried weapons, ammunition or explosives in error.
The survey was answered by more than a thousand passengers and was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
19.7% of the passengers knowingly breaking the TSA rules were Y-generations and less than 15% belonged to X-generations.
The most common violation of the rules was the introduction of food and liquids into the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted that they deliberately exported items with a blade to the aircraft, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported knowingly exported prohibited drugs to the aircraft.
The survey was conducted by passengers from all over the United States. The company wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken smuggled goods past the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travellers also take smuggled goods most likely past the security check – knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, the TSA guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often don’t know what liquids to take to the aircraft and how much.
It is therefore no surprise that most of the TSA's confiscations are liquids.
For a while, there was also the belief that books should not be taken to the plane.
Liquids may be taken on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the US Environmental Protection Agency, has reversed his decision to delay Obama's decision to reduce emissions
A day after 15 states had sued the EPA Director Scott Pruitt, Pruitt withdrew its previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's fumes-reducing decisions.
According to Prutti, the change shows that the agency he heads will take better account of the needs of decision-makers responsible for environmental issues in the Länder.
Pruitt did not mention in a word the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
States should start to comply with the 2015 ground level requirement for ozone as of 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year so that his agency would have more time to familiarise itself with the plan, because the agency “does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hamper economic growth”.
Pruitt was a public prosecutor in the state of Oklahoma before being appointed by President Donald Trump as the head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change of mind on Wednesday is the most recent setback to Pruitt’s plan to reduce regulations.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington ruled that the EPA director exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, obliging them to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
On Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his turn-over to the ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA’s cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in line with the schedule.
During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines, and then waited for activists and others to sue it for reaching an agreement on schedules," Pruitt said.
We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our operations and the powers it confers on us.”
However, the EPA’s opinion stated that Pruitt may continue to exercise its “power to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers” to ensure that the provisions “are justified and based on the best available information”.
The Republicans are pushing for a wider change in the ozone regulations in Congress.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, General Prosecutor of the State of New York, who has sued the EPA's state association this week, said the group intends to continue the pressure.
The change in the mind of the EPA as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia were involved.
Ground-level ozone is produced when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing problems in sensitized groups of people, and is also part of the cause of thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt’s sudden change of direction.
It is worrying how much pressure was required to make common sense to the fellow in charge of our breathing air,” says Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
We must continue to fight the Trump administration, as its ideological aim is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups of our own interest.
A manufacturer of supercars coming up with a SUV - "events in Ferrari style"
It will also invest in hybrid sports cars, while striving to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari's style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All cases of East Savo measles of the same virus type
Rantasalmi measles infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savonia, THL informs.
On Thursday, the laboratory of the Institute for Health and Welfare in Vironia has ensured that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savonia is the same virus strain as previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July by a person in the coastal strait is of the same type as the previous cases in Eastern Savonia.
Based on this information, all infections detected in Eastern Savonia are related to the first measles detected in the region in June.
The news is good because it means we have not come across any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that after the fifth disease, new infections may still occur until mid-August, and the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, doctor in charge of Soster’s primary health care.
No new measles infections or their suspicions have emerged since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the up-to-date vaccination protection of their own, Erkkilä points out.
Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a licensed roar
The pot soup was not even considered legal.
In the background, the argument that the process produces not only wine, but also methanol, which is toxic.
Making a plate at home is legal next year, but the legalization of pottery soup is not even considered.
The billet is made by fermentation, while the potion is distilled.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to wine.
There has been no political will to legislate the potion into everyman’s right, says Ismo Tuominen, Senior Ministerial Adviser at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the potion was not considered to be legalised.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the release of distilling, says Outi Mäkelä (Collector).
He is a member of a group of parliamentary groups of government parties that took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Permission to distil the pottery at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Tuominen says that home-cooking of alcoholic beverages is a simple rule: you can make alcohol at home by fermentation.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can now legally make a squeal at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and enables the production of a squirrel, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavours and aromas produced during their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, drinks can be prepared for themselves as much as they want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It should not be put on sale.
In Finland, the act of the guild is no longer a public health problem, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The proposal for the Alcohol Act is now being examined by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be discussed by Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's as if Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä is delighted.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital for suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already left the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is sentenced to prison in Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from the prison to the hospital, escorted by armed guards this morning.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examinations.
The Pistorius family spokesperson said that the former top athlete was in good shape.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Transliterated telephone conversations reveal that Trump has put pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
Communications between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone call on 27 January 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop public speaking about his intention not to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States ringed Nieto for having knocked out the wall project in public. “You can’t say that to the press,” Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also released a transcript of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a tense exchange of words took place.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia would be “ridiculous”, “corruptive” and “stupid”. According to Trump, the agreement negotiated during Obama’s term would make him look like an “idiot” because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call of the whole day.”
Georgian massacre: activists re-establish racist lynching in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury branded car passes the crowd in the small town of Monroe in the Georgian countryside and continues its journey towards the small Moore’s Ford bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver. Four armed men block the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and tils through the windscreen.
Passengers are afraid.
Roger, n--u!" the man snaps.
Get out of the car!
The cries break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a remake, which was presented on 22.7.2017.
However, the noise of shock is genuine when the hang loop is put on the neck of the “Roger”.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore’s Ford Bridge to recreate the 1946 events, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murders.
It’s confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the re-patterning arrangements.
It is a disgrace in history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our soul.
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Congressman of Georgia.
For him, re-patterning is a startling call to action, and it also reminds the residents of Monroe that the injustice has never been rectified.
We want the guilty to be brought to justice, we want things to finally be done, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice,” Brooks says.
We cannot recover and reconcile until we get justice.
The body of the victim who died in the massacre in Georgia was covered by a medical examiner 27.7.1946.
According to the FBI documents received by NBC, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were suspected of lynching.
No one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motivations for lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Blacks of the State of Georgia were given the Supreme Court's decision to vote for the first time in the presidential election.
At the time of the election, the FBI reported an incident in which black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, it was rumoured that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that she was expecting a baby for her.
According to the FBI, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid $600 in guarantees against which he was released from prison on 25 July 1946.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before the Moore’s Ford Bridge.
It turns out that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders,” the FBI report states.
It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, which involved the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses.
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
It was a murder of the right to vote,” he says.
They were murdered because blacks wanted to be told that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote.
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reconstruction of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and captivating. It is a description of a shocking racism that many people would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America.
It’s hard to watch, but even harder not to look at what Greene says is meant to be.
We don’t want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides,” the director says.
But I can’t create a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
This year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and twenty whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has played the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh says.
It is important, however, that this aspect of history be presented so that it will never be repeated again.
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The performance begins with a scene in which Malcolm shouts and pushes Hester. He is furious that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
Did you not hear? I told you to leave my country, n---u!"
Rascona, or Hester, answers.
Then there is the punch.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
What?!” asks Rascona.
He is confused.
Did I accidentally hit too hard?” he asks.
No," Greene said.
I just don’t think the whites used the word n--u at the time.
Yes," another black actor confirms.
It’s slang. You have to use a longer version.
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a spirit of friends.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the performance, but because they want to honour the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are slashing.
No one laughs.
The re-patterning process ends quickly and violently.
Screams, shots – and silence.
A woman in a black funeral dress stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks with every other word.
A few tens of metres away, fifty spectators wipe their eyes of sweat and tears.
Almost half of the audience is black and half white.
Among them are a couple who have come to see a performance of Ithaca in the state of New York, but most are local.
They have been guided by Brooks in the graves of the victims in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have turned the story into a reality. The atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat to watch artificial blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
They’re not really dead,” the little boy murmurs as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The lynching actors take off their capes and wipe out tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, a local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a harsh performance.
Don’t worry,” the woman in the performance comforts.
We know you are not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple from Altanta has a lively conversation with the black couple they have just met.
It is difficult for Denise Duplinski to find words when she describes the sensations of the performance.
It’s hard to listen to the terrible words and watch the terrible things that people say and do that look like you – just because they look like you,” he says.
The performance made me notice that lynches are still taking place,” he added. “It’s just called arrests.”
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning next year's performance.
Re-screening is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we’re experiencing, but it’s also an educational experience,” Brooks says.
Its message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.”
Getting rid of vegetables in shops will really save you this much by removing the "extra parts"
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of cauliflower already in the shop before weighing?
What about taking off a big hat part of the pineapple - it weighs just how much?
The answers are strongly divided: for one, it is a sign of the most extreme exhaustion, while others do not want to pay for the portions of vegetables that are not used and yet go home to trash.
The phenomenon is identified in the shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the vegetable section of K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people tear away the leaf parts of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are taken to biowaste in the store.
According to news published by the economic news, noodles at the vegetable counter amaze traders.
But how much does it really save money to remove the extra portions of vegetables before weighing?
What is the real point of a significant noodle?
We Women tested how the price changes when pineapple, top artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower are taken off the leaves or stocks.
Cauliflower: The price of cauliflower costing 2.10 euros was 1.80 euros, when all the leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing 2.30 euros fell to 1.95 euros when its stock was twisted off.
Latva artichoke: The price of EUR 2.60 came to EUR 2.40 when the short position was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without carrying 80 cents.
Result: If leaves and strains are plucked off, you can save at best a few dozen cents on one vegetable.
Considered as a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20%.
A total of 1.20 euros would have saved on these purchases!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - brass star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, AFP says.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a penalty fee of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, which played in the Spanish league.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million for the French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league braked the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment attempt.
Under the rules of the league, the buying club cannot pay the enforcement price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out the contract himself, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be presented to a new home audience during the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA investigates the details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association (UEFA) so that it could determine any disciplinary action that might arise from the case.
Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, among others, has suspected that the PSG is in breach of the rules of UEFA’s fair economic play through its use of money.
UEFA can punish a club that commits a loss of more than EUR 30 million over a three-year period.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its economic principles.
Neymar’s transfer to PSG will affect the club’s economy for many years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
PSG may, for example, sell several players for significant amounts, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaif.

Austin, 21, received violent burns from lightning strike - flash recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing ordinary work on an aircraft at the International Airport in Southwest Florida with a couple of colleagues, when suddenly a flash hit the plane from the rainy sky.
The power of lightning threw the plane into the land of Dunn near the wing of the plane.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and told me that my brother had an electric shock and he was in the hospital.
I just asked if she was alive," Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and hemorrhage.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't wait for that.
It is traumatic for everyone, says Autumn.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and revitalizes business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British education group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% as a result of the launch of a new restructuring programme in response to the pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company has already reduced 4 000 jobs in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it would again cut costs by £300 million in May as part of its third savings programme to revitalize the business that has deteriorated as a result of rapid digitisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in the Penguin Random House publishing house to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year. Its turnover increased by 1% in the first half of the year and was £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan. According to the authorities, a NATO soldier was killed and several others were wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in an attack in the Qarabakh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, the Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "self-made explosive device" carried by a person.
The statement reported that the condition of all injured people was stable and were treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1 662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, an area where Shia Muslims live mainly.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in the centre of Kabul, which was an attack by the country's most devastating militant group after the US-led forces plunged the Taliban into power in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, recent suicide attacks in Kabul have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA to reverse its decision to postpone the implementation of smoke mist regulations
The EPA ran its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during the Obama administration to reduce fumes-inducing emissions a day after 15 states had sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called “Ozone Definitions” in 2015 late Wednesday, which, according to the agency, is a sign of its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states,” said Scott Pruitt, director of the agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in line with stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 predominantly democratic states, including the District of Columbia.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of the era of Barack Obama, and the measures are part of a broader economic growth agenda.
Trump's actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to EPA’s website, breathing air containing ozone “may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a member of Isis' leadership had also sent building blocks to Sydney.
According to suspicions, the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the company was suspended before the security check.
The police do not explain in more detail why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device that excretes toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, for example, a public vehicle.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also continue.
Neste’s CEO: Renewable fuels performed well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes decreased, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company achieved a good result in petroleum products, sales volumes of renewable products reached record levels, and the development of the Marketing & Services segment’s operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will be able to complete the strategic investments announced earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in a press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future in a series of less than 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports facility in Los Angeles, until WBC's invincible lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked along the walk to greet Lomachenko, WBO's master of the upper featherweight series.
On Saturday, Garcia won the showtime with the unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner, and since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five boxers of different weight classes on a comparative list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, “How are you doing, Master?
Good luck in the match!”
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on seven Saturdays.
When the duo posed for the photographers, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas pointed out that a match between men would be “perfect in terms of size”.
I'm a former featherweight," Garcia said.
I went up [63.5 pounds] for Broner, but I’m not that big.
I am a small 63.5 kg.
I want to go back to the light series.
He must rise to the light series [61.2 pounds], then we can fight.
This is what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
Boxing needs this match.
Klimas asked whether the match should be held on a pay-TV channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko to make his debut in the light series later this year and to fight against Garcia (37–0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested to meet the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell are competing in the light series at the Forum on 23 September.
The match could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it,” Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to play on the channel that offers the best prize package.
We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
It’s right for me as soon as we reach an agreement...”
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as an “unbelievable fighter” and that he may be going to watch the Saturday match.
Lomachenko stopped praising Garcia and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked ‘very slow. Sore, Mike... but you needed to knock it out’.
Garcia said he first focused on showing the impact force and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them was going to be more and more intense.
This is the match we are waiting for.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best. “Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.”
Average salary 5 300 euros, training what happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
The last time Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom the banker’s investment adviser spoke a full bunny when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and various sales of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define competence requirements.
The Financial Industry (FA) itself recommends that the investment firm complete its own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for APV investment qualifications to a company called APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, whose degree working group consists of experts from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and other actors in the field.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, or Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
Its website says that in general both exams are "extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material of the degrees includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, says that the pass rate for the exams is roughly 70 per cent.
Most of the staff of the largest banks have completed either an APV1 or an APV2 qualification, as they are required by the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller banker movements without mentioning the names, whose personnel seem to have avoided completing the qualifications, Savikko says.
According to him, there are "some" such bankers.
Savikko says that since 2000, the APV1 degree has been awarded to 13 000-14 000 people and the most demanding APV2 qualifications recommended for investment advisors have been awarded to approximately 3 000 people.
Some bankers consider the degree to be an advantage.
Several other sectors have significantly stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the financial sector requires the completion of APV qualifications, because then the expertise related to the investment sector will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of monthly paid regular working hours is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working in positions earn more than EUR 5 900 per month and women earn more than EUR 4 500.
On average, the top 10 earners earn around EUR 8 100.
The tenth of the men who earn the most earn more than 9 000 euros per month or more, the tenth of the women who earn the most earn 6 400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
At the employee and task level, self-regulation has been trusted to date.
According to Fiva, the audit received individual cases in which the investment advisor’s expertise and competence were not sufficient on the basis of the advice’s activities.
In principle, it is also possible to act as a seller of investment products even if the level of expertise and competence is low.
In principle, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have significantly stricter competence requirements, Savikko says.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new MiFID II directive.
It requires that every company is responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are competent enough.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, on the other hand, has the power to determine what should be known.
Fiva’s market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current legislation is the regulation on the competence and experience requirements of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to Hovi, the new requirements apply to both investment firms’ own personnel and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The court states that, according to a proposal from the Board of Directors issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva was given the power to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in the coming autumn.
In the future, the company must also provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and continuing education.
All of this must be documented, and the company has an obligation to demonstrate that this has also been done.
The Court specifies that in practice the company must, for example, map the personnel’s job descriptions at individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the Hovi, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced if the knowledge or experience is not at a sufficient level.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the specified time criteria.
According to the court, the rules will tighten and become more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner "drawn" a giant aircraft on top of the United States
The plane's route was traversed by the United States at Flightradar24.
The flight was made on Thursday with a 787 Dreamliner, which was used by Boeing to test the long-haul durability of the Rolls Royce aircraft.
The plane that left Seattle flew in 18 hours and 1 minute over a distance of 15 700 km, which is longer than any regular commercial flight in the world.
The flight remained within the borders of the United States throughout the journey.
It flew through 17 states in total.
Imatra’s persistent beach swimming school children do not feel the rain or the sun’s heat - Iines Kaikkonen treads persistently with the help of a swimming pool village
Iines Kaikkonen made good progress, Taina Itkonen followed.
The beach swimming schools in Imatra will be running in Liete and Lemmukka this and next week.
Even though it rains sometimes and then shines again, young swimmers aren’t mocha either, says Taina Itkonen, the leader of the swimming schools.
In this week’s swimming schools, a total of 13 children will gain swimming skills next week, a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that the school and the preschool are already starting," Itkonen says.
The Imatra beach swimming school is organised in cooperation with the Sports Connect project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere on the beach.
The sun was shining and the young swimming school students were training to stay on the surface with the swimmers, someone without.
The smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines of Kaikko, 5, first questioned going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to tread towards the beach.
It's going well!
Iines Kaikkonen said that he had been swimming a lot this summer.
The beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, the swimming pool was used for swimming persistently by Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too can be satisfied with today's achievements," she praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted water wars again.
Ilona Villberg, her daughter Anna Villberg, who followed the 6, swim from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for learning how to swim.
Even though the weather has been what it hurts, Anna has liked to go here every day.
Sometimes we had to warm up.
The swimming school children packed on the pier.
The boys had enough to do with the frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacking fruit and frying the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no rush at the pier.
It is not part of the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's such a connecting story"
You can see all kinds of things.
Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product series a couple of days ago.
In other words, dish brushes and laundry racks - as well as a "toilet brush with a brim brush".
The unknown soldier refers to the film, which will be released this autumn, and to the marketing of the film.
Still, there is something special about the combination, and the products have been scratched on social media: When will the future unknown-health ties come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President of Sinituote, say?
We are a partner in the film.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määttä says.
According to him, the products will have a special presentation, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Is there not a little bit of a funny thing here - often thinking that there is something in common with the products and the stories associated with them?
Yes, there is such a common story here that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, says Määttä.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
Cleaning is not foreign to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other business partners in the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, e.g. the Hartwall vichys have been launched, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products have already been downloaded from Suomen Kuvalehti's blog Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and clocks are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still room for continuation.
The partners of the unknown have not yet revealed their war products, such as Valio, Refiner, Neste and the German retail goods chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
The results of the new age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were published
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. The results of the new assessment method reveal that more than 80 per cent of those tested were estimated to be over the age of 18. However, not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6 880 tests so far, and the National Board of Forensic Medicine has now published the results of 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Eighty per cent of those tested, i.e. in 2002 the asylum seeker was said to be over 18 years of age. In addition, in 25 cases, the forensics agency determined that the test was “possibly 18 years of age or older”.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was “possibly under 18 years of age”.
The tests were only carried out in cases where there were grounds to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
According to Johan Göransson, the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
The figures are fairly consistent. There are no major differences in the statistics for the previous months,” he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were said to be over the age of 18, this does not necessarily mean that they were lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there were “references that the study was 18 years old or older”.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people.
I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are not able to determine the age, we should not pretend that we are capable of doing so,” he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Finnish Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, one can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years old, with a risk of about 10%.”
Ilonen collapsed in 30 places in Scotland
Five more than par results in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen 30 points on the scoreboard down in the European round of golf in Scotland.
Ilonen left Saturday at 11th place, but at the end of the round he found 41th place.
In a difficult weather, Ilonen was accompanied by three bogs by one double bog.
Others were also difficult.
The Englishman, Ian Poulter, rose to share the top spot in one of the less than par rounds, even though he said there was enough work in the umbrella.
The weather was rough, but I was hanging around and finally the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares a leading position with his compatriots Callum Shinkwi and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia changes party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at the Trump campaign that he would change the party.
The Democrats simply rejected me,” Justice said.
Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection...Today I am telling West Virginia that I can no longer help you as the governor of the Democrats.
The audience burst into resounding applause.
Tomorrow, a member of the registered Republican Party,” Justice added.
As a coach, I would tell you that it is time for a new game.
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
The value of his assets is about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement that “the change of the party of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic party that builds barriers rather than a better America.”
The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party without leadership and unable to find a positive message that unites people," RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel said in a CBS statement.
Flashes sown damage - Thursday becoming even summer's hard thunderstorm day
At the end of the week, there will also be more thunder in southern Finland.
Over the past week, there has been thundering especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes set a number of fires on fire.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be a very big thunderstorm day so far.
The thunderstorms have also finally found Finland.
During the past week, lightning has been detected especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
On the table, lightning struck a row house in the power center, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a notification of the fire about 15 minutes to midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located at the end of the terraced house in the sauna room.
The rescue department dismantled the roof and wall to find fire pits and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
On the spot, the lightning lit up the exterior of the building on Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue department arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue department could only prevent the spread of the fire.
The outbuilding, about fifty square metres in size, burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, lightning struck the house in Rääkkylä.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
The rescue department visited to check the case, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses burst.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when lightning strikes damaged the traffic control system.
The information on the fault was received on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem could not be solved until just before five in the afternoon.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally also on the part of the track that was run by thunder.
The lightnings have caused destruction in different parts of Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
This summer's thunderstorms have been completely unresolved! says meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, who is on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but due to the low flash balance in the summer, many even feel strong.
This might seem like a really hard thunderstorm, but it has been this compared to the thunderstorms of this summer, says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the ground flashes blinked 1 700 times, and Thursday has had potential even for the toughest thunderstorm of the summer: by about 16 a.m. there were 1 790 ground flashes in the plaque.
If the lightning continues until the beginning of the evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-weak thunderstorm was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightning in the year was about 30 000.
By Wednesday, this year’s flash rate had risen to 18 386 flashes.
There is still room to catch so that this year does not break the two-year record.
However, Ukkoskir can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a good environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunderstorms will shift on Saturday from the northern parts of the country to the south, where about 2 000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
In the middle of the country, there will be a more unified rain front.
According to Tuovinen, in such cases, thunderstorms only rarely occur.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia made on Thursday due to the doping scandal. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to end the Russian ban on participation.
Dmitry Shlyahtin, Director of Russian Athletics, said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup that the Russian ban was appropriate and that he was going to fight doping.
He said he regretted "for all the athletes who took the gold or silver medal in the competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of extending the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after evidence of state-supported doping in Russia was presented in the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report.
I think his response today was very direct. It was a very open-minded presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation acknowledged that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do its utmost to reorganise its activities.
Coe also said he was “satisfied” with Russia’s acceptance of the terms of the ban.
I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that now is not the right time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
We need to do everything we can to normalise the situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the degraded system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with a neutral athlete in the World Championships in Athletics starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Task Force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
Testing is still inadequate, and the coaches who were banned continue to operate freely,” he told reporters on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed with the poor success of Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film did not become as successful as the authors hoped, says Yle.
If it is honestly said, I am disappointed, acknowledges that the film has been produced by Helsinki Film’s CEO Annika Sucksdorff in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100 000 viewers, which is about EUR 5 million in the film budget, compared to a little bit.
This is not a lottery win, but now it is important for investors to get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful in Finland, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign releases, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
Neymar's transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris in Saint-Germain in France is not hindered by European football clubs' money-restricting regulations.
Its potential sanctions against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by UEFA, which regulates European football and can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair play financial rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar’s transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million for the termination of the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary in the new club moves in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar’s transfer amount and attaching him to his star-carrying, as the royal family, enriched with Qatar’s oil, is being financed by the PSG.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums to acquire players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of income so that the football-related business is not loss-making.
Fair play financial rules were drawn up at the initiative of Michel Platin, who was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that indebtedness for success was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from club debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 made it significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player purchases, and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period of Fair Play’s financial rules will last until 2018. During this period, clubs will be allowed to make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini was forced to leave UEFA President's office in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
Fair play rules are still in place, and we will continue to apply them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for fair play financial rules in UEFA, told Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it may amortize the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recognised as an annual expense of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
On the basis of the fair play economic rules, the first sanctions were issued in 2014 to PSG and Manchester City from Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was restricted to 21 players in its Champions League group from 2014 to 2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may attempt to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies associated with the club's owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market, UEFA will not calculate the aid as the actual results.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatari tourism authority for PSG was overstated.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar’s earnings in the PSG could be financed by contributions from Qatar’s 2022 World Cup Organising Committee.
However, the PSG and the Organising Committee have denied that Neymar would be made an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to previous PSG sanctions, UEFA is more closely following attempts to circumvent the rules.
Sources that are aware of the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with the PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to Associated Press on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the situation on PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015–2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the previous period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and shirts.
The company estimates that its net sales will increase by at least 30 per cent with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the world's best players, tried to complicate the transfer of Neymar, allegedly violating the rules of fair play.
This is a clear economic case of doping, both for the club and for the state,” said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to the Qatari ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding of the football club.
The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment in the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of fair play, and there are so many advantages in the fact that the famous player represents the state.”
Now in a hurry: Finnish coach of athletes stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä’s coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be preparing for the World Championships in Athletics in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualification tomorrow and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump qualification.
However, the duo's coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in the British broadcast without success.
The coach has an invitation from the organisers of the World Cup as a document, but it is also not suitable for obtaining a visa.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or not," said Jorma Kemppainen, Director of Coaching.
He has always handled visa issues successfully himself, but now there are some problems.
He will do everything in his power to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Federation (SUL) for years.
It doesn’t matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the steps on the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach was missing.
The World Cup medal for Finland from London demands a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will start in London on Friday and last for over a week, ending on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value event to another, where the experience will mature to the level that the adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
Now there are no such young athletes or even veterans in the small World Cup team in Finland.
The World Cup medal for Finland demands a miracle.
Fortunately, the attraction and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws the bench athletes to the television screen and glues to follow the races, even though the London medals are not settled due to the time difference until late in the evening.
Finland received one bronze medal from the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The bravery awaits a medal from Pitkämäki even now, even though one of them is told by the results of his and other throwers in recent times, as well as by the fact that Pitkämäki will be eliminated in last summer’s prestigious competitions.
Whatever happens in these competitions, Pitkämäki will remain a great Finnish sports hero in history.
Entry to the finals or making your own record is good enough for other Finnish athletes.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finland’s athletics in the coming years will continue to be a good success in the international values competitions of young people this summer.
Developing young talent and supporting its work financially is more important than maintaining a small elite of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both training and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that the London Games will remain in the history of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of terrorist deterrence or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has been placed second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place on Copper Mountain is the best in the Big Air World Cup in Lake Rukajärvi.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried caballerial 1080 for the first time in his last jump, and it was very close to success.
It feels good and the feeling is good now, but I am sorry that the last jump didn’t go well.
I will try it again from now on," he said.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line’s new fast ship is stuck at the port in Helsinki
The shipping company Viking's new express vessel FSTR is very late from schedule.
The express ship had to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 18 noon.
There were eight loadings on board.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
For at least an hour and a half, I have been waiting to get on board.
Now the car queue is moving slightly, Estonian Johannes Rebane, who is waiting to get to the port of Helsinki, told us at 19.30.
Rebane thought that the new vessel had become a technical fault.
Rebane reported that the shipping company had imported water bottles for those waiting to board their cars.
Chief Communications Officer Christa Grönlund says to IS that there was a technical flaw.
It was repaired at the Port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn’s return journey for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20.15.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on 6th Thursday evening
The 42-metre-long special transport will move from Muukko to Mustola harbour during Thursday evening.
The departure at nine o'clock should be known by eleven o'clock in the evening.
The police guide traffic on the 6th road, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
In the case of Mälkija, the transport proceeds along the 13th road to the port of Mustola.
Small District nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously haunts the 80's glory days and the 90's grunge (then David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant The State sketch series for MTV) as well as their own time – 2001 – before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the rest of the series moved on to bigger stories in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memory we are stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived its time.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it was told, among other things, that H. Jon Benjamin was talking about the back story of a can of vegetables).
At the heart of the joke is that middle-aged actors are playing lustful teenagers approaching the age of majority, and emphasizing it makes it impossible to reach the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, nineties stalker films, such as the horror film The Hand that Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and “other stuff from 1991”.
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't got over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) with his accomplice George H. W. Bush (aptly played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the side paths.
It's especially fun to see the ever-young Paul Rudd with a beard tassel under his lower lip, that is, Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the film Singles. Rudd's Andy, the king of the camp, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may bring this series on the fly as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends will go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to the parallel nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series wrestling catalogue, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, and is made into a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where a Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism, and markism-leninism.
Starring the hard-faced Gregory and the idealistic Iosefina, Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But it is not much more.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (policemen spend time watching chess on TV, just like Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, the Comrade Detective gets too caught up in a clumsy socialist drama, including a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, which is why the series often starts to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is neither fast enough nor abundant.
To sum up, the series could work better as agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and in the lobby there are always two fat men eating hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make all kinds of consumer goods and fast food.
The fictitious Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we are eating up our own recent history and their history as well.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola will rise to the ring on Saturday in Macau - against a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match going.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macau because Brazilian Leandro Issa was still in the UFC last year.
Brazil also has a Jujitsu black belt and a World Championship.
For once, I fight against myself.
It's a fun thing," says 32-year-old Tauru.
He had to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles took place on a quick schedule in the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
Tauro has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time that my match was cancelled.
It annoyed me because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that there was a new time for the fight.
Waiting for a week does not have much effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve within a week.
The condition can get worse if you exercise too much now.
In his last few battles, Tauro has faced opponents whose strengths lie in standing.
This time the situation is different.
Issaa Kouvolaan describes a typical Brazilian.
He is a rather aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come in the first round hard and try to get on the carpet.
He has won the Jujitsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
The last match by Kouvola did not go according to plan.
Kevin Belingon, a Filipino, beat the Tauro in the corner of the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I have never played so well, especially in a standing position: he did not get a single hit.
When I went to pour, he hit my eyebrow.
It was really annoying for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the MMA fighters fight once a year, some rise to the ring more densely.
For example, a future opponent, Issa, fought the last time in September.
Tauro had three matches last year.
Now we are facing the second battle of the year.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
I have been training and being in good shape all the time in recent years.
However, I have been fighting just for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was training in Espoo and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good training when we had one friend from Sweden with us.
Training was a great help, because on Saturday, the Kouvolan will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been trained against opponents of the same size and practice a standing match.
Standing up is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to hit sensibly.
If there is an opportunity, of course, I will take the plot myself.
Downward exports must not be given for free, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts the previously Chinese-held Tauru.
It is said to be Las Vegas, China.
I think there is a big and nice evening ahead.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged as economic growth has been sluggish and inflation has ceased to speculate on rising interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue at a slow pace. The Bank shifted interest rate hikes due to increasing pressure on family income.
The decision makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee decided by a vote of 6–2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent. This month, the rise in interest rates received even less support, as economic growth has been sluggish.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6%, and warned that household income will be under increasing pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to 3% in the autumn.
According to the Bank, however, interest rate hikes will be needed in the coming years to curb the inflation accelerated by Brexit, and the Bank also announced that the loan costs may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive economic package, which began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide £15 million more, i.e. a total of £115 million, to banks through the programme.
The Protocol to the Bank’s decision on interest rates states: “According to the monetary policy committee’s forecast, the slow development of GDP will continue in the years to come, as the decline in households’ real income will reduce consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for “some degree of tightening of monetary policy” market expectations “a little more broadly”.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases are ‘gradual’ and ‘limited’.
In May, the Bank forecasted an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and of 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
The pound against the dollar declined by 0.5% and was $1.31, down 0.4% against the euro and was €1.11.
The decision to maintain interest rates was made after lower-than-expected growth rates dampened expectations of interest rate increases, with GDP growing by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases, and the bank says that the situation will deteriorate even before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy “cannot prevent” a fall in income in the coming years, but it expects that wage developments will recover “significantly” at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound, which will offset some of the impact of private consumption on the economy.
The decision was made one year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% after a shocking EU referendum that plunged the pound.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the ECB’s latest decision, interest rate hikes had become increasingly loud as inflation tightened the pressure on households, with three decision-makers calling for an interest rate hike of 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased last month to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation will increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, exceeding its target level of 2% was due to a “totally” weak pound.
Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be intensifying further as lenders are feverishly looking for customers and want to end the year strongly,” said Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Renewal agreements are increasingly popular, their interest rates are low and there are also cost-free options available.
NHS appoints 10 000 controversial HIV drugs
As of September, patients may be prescribed a ‘reversible’ HIV prevention drug. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute over the financing of the drug in the English public health system (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year trial. A pre-consumption drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal held the Supreme Court’s judgment last year, which states that the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP drug, although it claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
On Thursday, NHS Director Simon Stevens called the announced decision a "significant new intervention" and the National AIDS Organization described it as "a crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to accept registrations for an experiment that will expand in October to other clinics.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in high-risk groups.
A drug taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during sexual intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics select candidates who meet the conditions for the trial, from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and who have registered for general medical care can also apply for a trial at a local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the English NHS signed a contract this week for pharmaceuticals after an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, taking and implementation.
This major new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective measures to prevent HIV,” says Stevens.
That is yet another remarkable achievement in the battle that has been going on for more than 30 years to solve one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organization.
If PrEP is correctly targeted to those in need and at risk, it can have a turning point in the UK HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, members of the risk group will receive a drug through an experiment funded by the NHS, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner, with an empowering effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news.”
It is now the most important thing to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one belonging to the risk group is excluded from it,” says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection.”
The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that lasted unnecessarily for several months due to the slowdown in the government,” says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
We have evidence that the medicine can have a turning point in our work to prevent HIV and end the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important to start the experiment as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.”
Quality of life: the interlayer and smart interior design solutions have made the small Earl’s Court home a spacious home
In 2014, Joanne Leigh, a former banker who was enthusiastic about real estate renovation, moved to a smaller apartment in Earl’s Court in Knightsbridge.
The apartment is on the first floor of the Queen Anna-style house. The success of the renovation is explained by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her camp and changed.
Before this, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a significantly larger apartment,” Joanne says.
I am looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the apartment screen and noticed that the rooms were as high as they were at the time in my apartment.
I fell in love right away and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete deformation.
Joanne wanted more storage space, as well as an intermediate layer to make use of the room height.
I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my demands,” he says.
He hired Erfan Azadin from the Duck & Shed design agency in Notting Hill, where Erfan was tasked with building a space of almost four metres in height and creating an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale site, but also a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an interlayer that could stand.
The solution required Erfan to think creatively.
Steel structures are quite complex.
The rooms had to be arranged so that they do not have to be crouched.
The structures had to be adjusted so that the height was just right both on and below them.”
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the middle floor, a copper window of Retrouvius opens to the elegant lounge.
Mirror-gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, sense of space and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem more time-consuming.
A mirror in the kitchen is like a window that opens up a view of another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The style is enhanced by the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
The kitchens with a folding door are not a new solution,
But Joanne's kitchen is unique in that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
It required little planning,” Erfan says about the steel-reinforced veneer-surfaced MDF door.
It is balanced, i.e. it slides very easily when lifted into place.
With the rational use of space and the design of the storage space, Joanne gained 16 extra square metres, a second bedroom and an even better floor plan.
When selling an apartment, the area is determined – or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area.”
The surface area of Joanne’s apartment was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
The tenant is in contact with the materials in the apartment, and the emotional bond to the apartment is partly based on them,” Erfan says.
No one is attached to the electrical wires on the walls.
They are also important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example of how good design and additional squares can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiates in her summer looks
Princess Sofia's choice of outfit hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Båstad in Sweden for the last time before her birth.
For the dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the Princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented the event with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a stunning blue body-prone outfit that beautifully dressed a pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia represents before her birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For the dinner of the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress, which landed magnificently.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue dressed the princess well.
Sofia has been on a mission in Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia completed her life with a little bag.
Sofia was radiating in her fresh summer looks.
Sofia even got excited to talk to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach," Sofia said, laughing and referring to her late pregnancy.
He grows us with sweet chilli
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared in the Lahti market where Thai food was sold.
The people of Lahti did not dare to taste, but walked past.
The food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among acquaintances Panja.
He did not know much about Finnish, and at that time the Finns did not know Thai.
Because the people did not dare to go to eat, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Lahti people to eat Thai food, a spring roll at a time.
Take a look at the countries, he said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai restaurant at the Lahti Market Hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and places are limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
Little by little, we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat down at the plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by the side of the market hall, but then the restaurant had to change, because the self-made spices smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the market hall.
There is room.
Now, again, we swindlers can sit at our own tables, only in the most congested times will we be shy to ask ourselves if there is room next door.
Panja knows her customers.
He will be told what has happened and who has been seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how customers’ life stages change and the food company changes.
He remembers the man I went to eat my first spring roll.
She remembers me as lean and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It's nice to have lunch a little later than the others, sit at my own place next to the kitchen door and exchange the belongings with Panja, who is leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chilli sauce.
He has opened not only our sense of taste but also our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he has had a hard time, he is always kind.
He is hardworking.
On top of the restaurant work, he visits mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated its two decades of completion.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without a fuss or attention, this was a significant day, at work.
The discovery of an external base revealed 173 Isis terrorists ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, security authorities had access to a list that was important for counter-terrorism work.
The list contains more than 170 Isis fighters ready to attack Europe.
According to Die Welt in Germany, there are 173 people in total and the document contains not only their personal data, but also pictures of each person.
More than 130 Iraqis are included in the list, but six Europeans are also included.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have become more accurate.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and images while investigating the terrorist organisation's underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the fall of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person’s home country.
The list also includes a breakdown of terrorist specialities.
For example, in the case of the German 27-year-old Sami J., Abu Assid al-Almani, i.e. German, reads as a combat agent.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, first travelling to Egypt, then Libya and later via Turkey to join the ranks of ISIS.
A suicide bomber has been written next to his image.
There is no specific information about a man's fate.
A total of about 6 000 fighters have left Europe in the ranks of ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
A man sank under the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on interviews with the rescue department, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
A person was rescued under the water at Tokoinranta, Helsinki, on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, firefighter on duty at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescue department diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue department received a notification after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered into the hands of emergency care.
Estlander says he was about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander commends the cooperation between the Border Guard and the police.
This was a task led by the Border Guard.
The participants also provided excellent guidance to the divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars crashed in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered milder injuries, says the on-call firefighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads at four o'clock in the day.
The accident occurred when one car turned behind the warning triangle in front of the other, says the on-call firefighter.
According to the Rescue Department, there is an 80 km hour speed limit in the intersection area.
Brothers fight over $500 million in real estate
Two brothers argue over Victoria's largest property empire, worth over $500 million, and join the family business set up 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Tooraki district just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the dispute to the Supreme Court over the division of property and business property between brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter controversy about the difference.
Together, the brothers and their mother Anna own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property when they bought a deal on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family established a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds of the assets of the company, and Paul describes his father as “the family’s driving force and the central character”.
According to the court documents, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns real estate for about $316 million and Paul for about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal,” Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
The case was first heard in the Supreme Court last Friday after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says this is not true. He blames Paul for the poor management of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first sworn testimonies that he would like to find a solution.
In accordance with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing for me,” Colin says in a statement.
There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and reports, and the case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, including Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin set up the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started a trade in “the last years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons in harmony.
Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to go to court,” Anna writes in a statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis group business, according to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are bitter about the economic conditions of their departure.
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is a former member of the board of the Australian Football League and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, and he said in his text message that he could not correctly comment on the matter because it was being dealt with in court.
It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and, according to the name of our family, drag me to court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
Our father would not have liked us to argue in this way,” Colin continued, hoping for a solution.
On Friday, hope seemed to have gone out.
Our case will be settled in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the use of the President's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico, the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit President Trump’s media use and news coverage so that the boss doesn’t get so often in trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
When the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with the executives on his first working day, he raised a key issue he intends to solve: he intends to limit the access of President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information, whether printed or consulted, must pass through him because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information.”
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump’s media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television – and as president he still watches a lot of television.
If the presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media were more equitably involved,” Sam Nunberg, an advisor to the Trump campaign, told Politico in February.
At the time, Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote that, “Six former campaigners said that managing Trump’s Twitter use is essential for his personal media stream to include a steady stream of praises.”
All right.
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s use of Twitter has never been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don’t know – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump did not send.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing factions in the White House that are trying to run their case by providing Trump with information that supports their view, which can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisors deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher said in a case:
Trump’s current and former employees say that he can be extremely angry about the newspaper games he is being criticized for, especially if they tell about harmful data leaks, so he has to know where the information comes from.
That was the case at the end of February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news on GotNews.com, a website set up by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment and had previously spread false allegations and later retracted them, and he did not provide any concrete evidence.
Despite that, Trump had started to talk after reading a question about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter, "had tried to implement a document management system for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will turn out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pursuing their own affairs.
These immutable facts make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, AFP says.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a penalty fee of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, which played in the Spanish league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated and he was free to move to the Parisian club PSG.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million for the French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaif.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success author Raija Oranen overcomes alcoholism and flight fear with hypnosis: "I'm in the right shape of my life"
Raija Oranen, a successful writer known for her television series Rose Time and Pure White Sheets, has just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
In addition to writing, five grandchildren keep their grandmothers so fast that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the sun in Spain and the apartment in Fuengirola after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left the rental apartment.
In the light and in the sun, out of the old circles, Raijan was once led by depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The external appearance is also 20 kg lighter.
The weight went down when the anti-inflammatory drugs were stopped, they were mood medications.
I got help with alcoholism from hypnosis, which also made me fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, have been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
She has always been that queen of drama, she has ended her life with that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Oranen, who has made a great career as a writer, remembers only the 44-piece Pure White Sheets TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to become the industry of the Fresh Family Company when I read the 50th anniversary interview of Liisa Seppälä on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and I sometimes worked as a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
For him, the plot and story of the series changed the Finnish attitude towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and thesis revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, she has many scripts under work - ideas for hundreds.
Migrants return over the ditch to the “library of the millionaires”
One of the wealthiest houseowners in the West Midlands is once again on a hair note with persistent rotations who managed to cross the ditch that the municipality needed and return to the field next to the houses.
Travellers park their twenty caravans near a street called the “Millions’ alley” in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but managed to cross the moat that the municipality needed as a barrier, bringing with them children, horses and the army of vans.
Circumstances managed to overcome a barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
The infuriated residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of "perfect inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident reported that the convicts had arrived Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at the passers-by.
The municipality must be toughened to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
Travellers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them in the evening, and probably even more today.”
The resident reported that the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it’s frustrating to pay municipal tax when a municipality can’t do anything about it.”
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the aliens returned so soon after they were driven away.
There are more of them, and they have even fallen into a horse-grazing park.
According to a spokesperson from Solihull Municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. “We are taking legal action with Solihull Police to evict campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activities to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for the purposes of legal proceedings.”
Infuriated people besieged Portugal's plane
In Portugal, men who have made a forced landing on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
As a result of the forced landing, two people died yesterday.
Two men who have flown the plane may be charged with the death penalty.
At its longest, 16 years of imprisonment can be obtained in Portugal.
Yesterday, due to a technical fault, a small plane flying by men had to make a forced landing on the beach near Lisbon at Sao Joao da Caparica.
At the time of the incident, there were hundreds of people on the beach, some of whom ran a landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit a man with his back on the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane got up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, said Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash with anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started to hack it, said Celia Rocha in Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the crash.
The Finnish star who lost her leg tragically won the World Cup again: "Without the accident, I would not be a world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning Finnish time in the World Gold Banked Slalom competition in Big White, Canada.
In the past, Suur-Hamari also won cross-country gold.
All in all, there are already three World Cup titles.
A pretty amazing World Cup!
Twice the gold was treated, the time is spent at a good heart," said Suur-Hamari, who had been reached by phone.
The 30-year-old counter praised his coach and his very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is growing all the time.
The whole board has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are decreasing, and there are many new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there will be a black horse behind you.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Suur-Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had fallen eagerly from a young age with his friends, and the accident did not take him to the slope.
It comes to mind from time to time what my life would be like without it.
But my attitude has always been that it is pointless to do so.
The cards that have been dealt are played, says Suur-Hamari.
It would be cruel to call serious misfortune and the loss of limbs a stroke of luck, and neither does Grand-Hamari.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned out to be a victory.
I would not be a three-time World Cup without disaster.
Before the accident, the greatest pleasure of boarding for the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar was already waning.
The job towards the top really started only after the accident.
I was training with my friends when I was young, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there at the start of X-Games.
I would not have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to pull my overalls up and start working.
I would say that I have succeeded quite well.
The skier was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka Tähti as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner was awarded at the January Sports Gala.
According to Suur-Hamar, the victory of the Star is an important signal to the parasports people.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
This will certainly also open the eyes of the parasports world.
When is the time to launch the World Cup’s Matti Suur-Hamar Athletes of the Year campaign?
It will then be seen in due course.
I try to do my best to succeed.
As yet, Suur-Hamari has not conquered all of the peaks he desires.
Next year there will be a great goal.
In a year, the Paralympic Games will take place in South Korea.
We're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youth do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees frying bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently.
According to them, the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their home country.
The Trump administration is not seen as bringing about a change in the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, a communications agency, investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying Arab youth opinions and attitudes for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men, responded to the survey.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
42 per cent of the respondents may think they will return to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in a permanent return home, while a quarter of them think that the most important thing would be to leave the country.
Less than one-tenth of the respondents consider the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria to be the most important factors influencing the decision.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked what was the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the renunciation of President Bashar al-Assad.
More than a quarter consider al-Assad's presidency to be an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current conflict in Syria.
The only way to resolve the conflict through military action is to believe in just over a quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see the decline in ISIL’s power in the last year, while a fifth feel that its power has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against Isis, and terrorism in general, is that the media should inform people that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many made military measures and education reform a priority.
More than a tenth of respondents think that the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe that the Syrian conflict will worsen in the Trump era.
Opinions are divided into two as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time encoding to keep the internet organized - the database he developed is used by, for example, Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB, an Espoo-based company, is developing the world’s fastest growing open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, does not cost users anything and can be developed online by any excellent programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
Databases keep huge masses of data in order and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the Chief Technology Officer at MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely from beautiful hands helps to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database, MySQL, together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, the software giant Oracle was bingeing Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle transaction took place, a large part of the developers of MySQL announced that they would leave.
They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a firm promise of the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company at this stage, which started to develop MariaDB.
He did not want his life's work to die.
I hired about twenty of the best developers from Sun to ensure the continuity of the code with the help of the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch from it.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was established to monitor the development of MariaDB code.
During MySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius regrets.
Although many people have heard of Widenius and the MySQL billion trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50% a year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, Chief Financial Officer of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is a sparsely worded company’s key figures.
He reveals that MariaDB expects to receive orders worth EUR 20 million in the current financial year.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to change databases, which can be a contract for more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
You can switch from MySQL to MariaDB in no time, because they are versions of each other.
For example, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Alibaba’s Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in distribution packages for Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections with the biggest players.
Among our customers are the world’s largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks,” Paqvalén says.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in its closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although Gartner says that the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, players like MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast-growing, in terms of turnover.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases do not even reach $1 billion.
However, the weight of an open source cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay for any of these software.
Research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will develop more than 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been changed to open or at least the transition would have started.
Big companies do not get new customers, as most of them choose an open source.
This has led to licensing fees for commercial databases jumping into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to with a smaller number of customers," Widenius says.
Since it is difficult to change a closed database, the majority of customer companies have ingested price increases obediently.
There are a lot of customers who find it very difficult to migrate because their old applications and others are closed in the database," Widenius says.
However, he still believes that the customers' measure is coming to a full end.
When license fees increase every year, the customer will sooner or later move to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent higher, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Moreover, many companies are facing major system changes as they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now looking to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually from databases.
Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed at how money is wasted on closed healthcare systems in Finland, for example, when open systems are cheaper and the customer is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say open source is an ideology, but I think it’s a better way to code.
The community helps and does what it cannot or cannot do.
55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source promoters in addition to another Finnish Linux developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still make 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this topic.
Italy tightens its attitude towards civil society rescue ships
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on their vessels to rescue refugees in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they commit to the new rules of their activities.
If NGOs are not committed to the new Code of Conduct, it will be difficult to see how they could continue to operate,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit's warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized the vessel of the German Jugend Rettet, whose crew was suspected of collaborating with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, the aid organization refused to comment on the detailed charges of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area,” the organization announced in a social media statement.
We can only assess the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of having taken on board the boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who reintroduced the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a couple of kilometres from the Libyan coast, as evidenced by a prosecutor's document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have defied the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine non-governmental organisations involved in search and rescue have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not cause “significant changes or obstacles” to the organisation’s rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to comply with the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders organisation.
Minniti, on the other hand, noted that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy through rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he considers to be evidence of the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
In recent days, light has started to appear at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He revealed that there are plans this month to continue discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his common-law spouse in Enontekiö, suspect found in the terrain - a case for the prosecutor
The suspected crime took place last December in Kutta, Enontekiö.
According to police, a 36-year-old man in the Czech Republic is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspect would have fled with two dogs into the terrain after his act.
A man was found colded off the ground and did not resist when he was caught.
The charge in the case must be filed within less than a week.
The case may still be referred to the District Court of Lapland in August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My All-haired Friends, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The death of the actor was announced on Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began her acting career at the age of 24 in the theatre.
During his long career, he also starred in films and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of the magic minister Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his veterinary role in the television series My All Haired Friends, based on the book by James Herriot.
The BBC's popular series was filmed through a total of seven channels.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for text messages incited to suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for texting and making phone calls to incite her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, performs 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced to death in June. Her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
My family is broken,” Conrad’s father said at the Thursday session.
My son was my best friend.
Carter appealed against the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter listened to his judgment with his hands crossed with a crying look at the ground.
His actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
He decided to improve Conrad’s life for his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the work,” the prosecutor continued.
He has not shown remorse.
According to Carter's lawyer, the incident was caused by "a shocking circumstance that Carter deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter’s “age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions.”
The prosecutor read out a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which she said that "no more than a day will pass, so that I will not mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I cope with all this. I will try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear.”
Conrad's sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that she was "stricken" by the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to her children.
It’s painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born. That pain never goes away,” Camdyn said.
There seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
Hang yourself, jump from the roof, stick yourself. I don’t know, there are many ways,” Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on holiday with his family at the time.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention with Roy's death. The judge ordered that Carter not benefit from the incident by interviewing him.
The case has been shared by experts.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's statement that "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: Relations with Russia Worst since the Cold War
The alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think one can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in Eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to ensuring that tensions do not reach their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Prior to Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump said that the US-Russia relationship had even reached a dangerously low level.

Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the backlash experienced by car manufacturers
One day before the announcement of the Audi, BMW offered to upgrade to more than 350 000 car software.
The head of BMW said the company believes that there are “more reasonable options than driving restrictions”. He referred to European cities, including BMW’s home town of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve their CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission neutralizing devices will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of accommodating and ignoring the problems of large car companies.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes. Volkswagen installed fraud equipment in cars that reduced emissions to the regulations in the tests. In normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the engine development department of Audi, who was responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent the European emission requirements. The charge was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi’s investigation may significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: the luxury car manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionate.
Venezuela’s vote started a fraud investigation, big demonstrations in the future
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election result," the chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Tibisay Lucenan, told reporters.
Maduro confirms the end of the crisis
On Sunday, a controversial vote was held in Venezuela to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organised its transformation against the demonstrations.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be in progress at the time of their appointment.
According to El Pais, the country’s national security forces began to take over the country’s parliament building on Wednesday evening.
The troops are meant to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Laventel has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had declined due to drought and disease-bearing insects, and scientists and farmers were feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
Lavender is in danger in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which have led to a marked reduction in spring and autumn rainfall,” says Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence.
This shortens the life of lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small piles to the area that spread micro-bacteria.”
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Instead of long cones and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether,” Chaisse says.
In other words, there are fewer and fewer components containing essential oil.
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing soil moisture evaporation and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and by developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
Journalist murder embodies growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the most recent cases related to organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in Sinaloa.
Today, however, there is a debate about security due to the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been advised to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leave the children at home or take them with them to the delivery that was the subject of a massacre in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. Evidence is not required, observations and feelings are sufficient.
Names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on government or drug cartel payrolls are written on the board.
According to the Reporters' Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder, editor and source of inspiration for Riodoce.
The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge image in which Valdez shows the middle finger. The picture reads: “Justice”. Thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts decorated with Valdez’s smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a panama hat that has become a trademark.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office was established, in particular, to deal with journalists' cases, but so far, according to the Journalists' Protection Committee, only two charges have been brought.
Journalist murderers rarely go to court, as do thousands of drug trafficking and organised crime murders every year, but few end up in court.
Riodoce journalists intend to continue writing about Sinaloa's violence, even though they have been broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is of little use, because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time,” he says.
We can’t trust anyone as long as we don’t know the cause of the event.”
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks on his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of their car and shot twelve shots. The number is probably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was grieved by her wife and two adult children.
The rumours move quickly and freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death has been silenced.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot dead every day, and the cemetery has two-storey ornate graveyards of drug barons that are larger than the homes of many.
The state on the coast is “peaceful” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's founder and director, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a rival group engaged in war against Guzman's sons.
Guzman's sons may have been annoyed by the case: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every number of the magazine as soon as the magazine arrived at the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdezia was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published in the same article was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up Riodoce with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, it was “impossible to do journalism without dealing with a drug problem,” Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel bold and honest about its stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the Journalists' Committee on International Press Freedom for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade without ever ever increasing.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
I want to be able to go on with my life,” he said, receiving a prize from the Journalists’ Protection Committee.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
A journalist must take on a task that falls to him – or play a fool.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when I was bathed in death – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
Riodoce’s staff miss Valdezia – a joker who cursed like a dock worker. They miss a friend who always gave a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always used a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines were his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to think about how they can best do their job and stay alive.
Criminals don’t like it if we talk about their women and children and their clean business, their secret runways for drug trafficking.
They were left out of the story,” Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
trusting your instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Andres Villarreal, a Riodoce journalist, is that “the impression can fail, and that happened in the case of Javier.”
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only government-sold spyware had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter from the heat of 40 degrees.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle class area of Culiacan.
Some journalists questioned whether these two policemen were among the 50 percent who the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited a mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's editorial team planned three main issues.
The brother of Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block from the Public Prosecutor's Office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who had been abducted and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in a number of public cases.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write in the same place in previous cases, one of which, “El Chapo” Guzman’s son, managed to escape and avoid a military raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez’s column provided reliable information on the abduction.
Previously, we would have already known what had happened,” says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received the nickname “El Flaco”, Ohukainen, due to his slim physique.
Now all links to our sources of information are broken.”
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse where signs and stickers against journalists' persecution are stored. The employees of the magazine have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for the freedom of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him the next morning when he went to the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration that was again the cause of the journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on DNA tests conducted by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest louder throughout the country, with “SOS Press” texts appearing on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to gain international support for Valdez's investigation.
On the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with Sinaloa's governor and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked that he be removed from government affairs because he is concerned that he is unable to be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organised crime, crime-prohibiting authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco-journalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed, under the orders of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and authorities.
In Mexico, people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez says.
Murder has a paralyzing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: “I am here for my writings.”
Next to his cut-off head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to stop their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern part of the country bordering Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslav Breach in March.
Some of them continue to operate, such as the Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on his front page for drug cartels: “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and you must be alert all the time.
Sometimes the criminals look for a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra – who was supposed to become a poet at the time – admits that writing about the drug trade is frightening.
I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he says.
A while ago, Riodoce journalists sat at midnight in front of the delivery on the sidewalk with a beer, after the latest issue of the magazine had been completed.
In a shooting between rival gangs and security forces, 19 people had died at the Mazatlan beach resort.
The war accelerated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put the news on Riodoce’s website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be reinstated the next day.
Sirens were howling nearby – yet another shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the police guarding the delivery:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
The delivery of Riodoce continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait of a man showing the middle finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can’t even consider quitting. “How can I end the magazine when our trainee asked us to get on the street and do something the same day Javier was murdered?”
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard Place"
In April, the 39-year-old Hannu Manninen’s party was short-lived, as the professional pilot started his career in the Olympic season.
However, the exercise period started catastrophically when Manninen became ill with the flu.
It was the beginning of a long period of ill health, which stretched to almost five weeks.
May was practically complete when I was ill.
First there was flu and finally there was a kind of childhood disease like ear infection that I had to eat an antibiotic course for.
I was able to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I didn’t get the enthusiasm to practice,” Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Cup was not granted a traineeship until the second week of June, which was reflected in the Kihu roller mat test conducted on 12 June by the Finnish Competition and Top Sports Research Centre.
In the test, the athlete skis with roller skis on the carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last autumn I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
The wall came up, Manninen says.
For the better
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says that she remained healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises to normalize the metabolism of the body.
Now there is a really good five-week period behind.
Midsummer was also a week and a half away from flying.
I also had time to go to the cottage with my family.
Last season Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening competition, when Manninen rose to 18th place in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and the team’s head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan that extends until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythmic training compared to last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cups.
In December, the intention would be to participate in at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans should still be in Seefeld.
Hopefully the name will be on the Olympic team's list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manninen’s sixth Winter Olympics.
The most important thing now is to stay healthy, a nummela underline that celebrated gold in Salt Lake City in 2002.
Dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a frightening statue.
Now, scientists have revealed the first novels of a rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts call it Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that the researchers could even determine that its scaly skin was reddish brown and had had a “problem past”.
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur and the best of its kind in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly significant discovery.
According to National Geographic, an armoured vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found at the Suncor Millennium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on 21.3.2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his finding further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the royal paleontological museum of Tyrrell.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from 1,100 kilograms of boulders.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping,” says scientific writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
It remains in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Research on skin found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a armour and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armour masks it from predators and is also protected by a darker and lighter colour that is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to blend into its environment and avoid its enemies, with larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old Nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May, and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
Researchers have named it Borealopelta markmitchelli, according to museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team from which it took over 7 000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so surprisingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armour.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general colour scheme, where the body is darker on top and lighter below.
The finding was still a surprise, because Borealope is significantly larger than the existing animals with similar colours.
From this it can be concluded that meat-eating dinosaurs prey to such an extent that evolution favoured survival rather than combat.
Of the present animals, e.g. deer, zebras and armadillas have a similar colour. They are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
The prey of a large, heavily armoured dinosaur tells us how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaurs were,” Brown says.
A chemical analysis of the organic compounds of nodosaurus scales reveals that its leather was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its gut to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river when it died and drifted into the sea, where it sank on the back of the seabed.
Alberta was as warm at the time as it is now in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to extend much further than they are today.
This nodosaurus is really significant because its scaly leather has been preserved and has also been preserved three-dimensionally in its original form,” Brown says.
That’s why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
To perceive it does not require much imagination: if you squint a little eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping.”
The Cretaceous era was the era of the theropods, the huge two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopelta, its great predecessors may have caught this armoured dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, the Acrocantosaurus, a six-tonne monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus scientists have been published in Current Biology, believing that Borealope was washed into the sea after his death and mummyed in the mud.
It was found at the Suncor Millennium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on 21.3.2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armoured dinosaur with its skins and armour from muzzle to hip.
Nodosauruses averaged five metres in length and weighed up to 1 300 kg.
Two half-metre spikes were raised from their pallets.
Scientists believe that this armoured vegetarian passed through the current western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armour has been preserved down to small details in the underwater grave.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its leather remains in the pitted plates of the armour along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such survival is “as rare as a lottery win.
The closer you look at it, the more astounding it feels.
Fossilized leather is still present in the bumpy plates of its skull armour.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the scales on its foot.”
How did an activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
She had arrived in New York a day earlier from her home in St. Louis and was sitting on her airbnb apartment bed browsing Facebook on her phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and his body is still on the street.
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information to his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharaoh.
The user name belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. The white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old Blackman in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
This is incredible,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that evening, people were told that they were accumulating on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police locks and shouting people, as well as a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, whose sign read: “Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell followed a real-time video of the police standing in front of the protesters with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video in which another police officer tuned his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill all of you... the animals."
This is not normal,” Ferrell remembers.
It was not the kind of murder that we are already used to and that could be said to be typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight home the next day.
The plane landed at eleven o'clock in the evening. Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years has been made in the documentary Whose Streets, which premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who set out on the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with their daughter in a flower dress and a crown that was compatible with it, they had another conversation about “what it’s like to live in black and under what circumstances.” They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
Do you remember when I told you how the blacks had to fight for what they believe?” Ferrell remembers saying to her daughter.
We’re going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
I couldn’t help but take my daughter with me,” Ferrell said later.
Today’s events are the culmination of the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow up to it.
He must have the capacity for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of living as a black person, and he must know what we must do to liberate ourselves.
Fortunately, although I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still like other black girls.
I feel that I would harm him if I protected him from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists who were waiting for information about the case and eventually learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
My activism changed completely after August 9," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chair of a minority student organization, where he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, an assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar “wanted to tell” what was going on.
He asked Ferrell, “Do you really want to tell what is happening, or do you want a story that you can use?”
The reason for this suspicion was the innumerable appearance of people in the local community, usually whites, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice,” Folayan recently said in an interview. “We wanted to do things differently.”
Folayan had already contacted co-director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism with prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals. The crew followed the events in the years following the Brown shooting.
This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks on our behalf, but we speak,” Davis says.
For me, the most important thing was how local people were portrayed in the film, because I was portrayed in the same way.
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader, but about a community". However, Ferrell proved to be the most open of the depictions.
That’s why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
I felt pretty naked,” Ferrell laughs, telling me what it felt like to see a movie for the first time.
But I understood that this work and the human portrayal of blacks require a certain vulnerability.
In addition, Ferrell’s story times and brings back to centre the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was created on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with queer identity.
The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going,” says Ferrell. “It’s because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.”
Folayan agrees: “The movement is indeed maintained by black women, among whom there are a lot of queer women.”
He stresses, however, that Ferrell was not “intentionally” selected for the document because of his queer identity.
He got the energy going,” Folayan says.
It is no coincidence, however, that she was at the forefront. Black queer women live at the cutting point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the big screen.”
The news crews have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the relationship between the community and the police is still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years left on parole, and was convicted of blocking the motorway during the demonstration.
His description of the social political atmosphere in his home corners is short and concise: “A mess.”
Yet he still relies on the slogan he learned from the outside on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.”
A fitting resemblance: the artist creates portraits of the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the Fridman Gallery in New York, there is an exhibition space in the middle of the face – white, black and brown faces, between which you can see similarity in more detail.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from the cheek and hair of Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he served his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking secret diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transgender and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, opinion on the malleability, ambiguity and causality of the DNA data and identity underlying the interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has been openly associated with women since puberty. In 2013, she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, who was sentenced to prison: a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which a troubled-looking Manning sits in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-coloured wig that became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a hugely successful Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data. He received DNA data, for example, on cigarette butts and chewing gums, and created images of what the people in question could have looked like.
The artist then received an email from Paper Magazine.
They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story,” Dewey-Hagborg said at a press conference at the new exhibition.
He was unable to visit Manning and could not be photographed in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence friends, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-created the Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted the future in which the president would have mitigated Chelsea's verdict and he would be able to watch the show.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven years in a civil military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is opening right now, when Donald Trump is waging his own war against data leakers and transgender soldiers and is coming up with new ways to strengthen the powerful dichotomy he was actually supposed to reduce.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has a purpose”.
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist’s statement and under it Manning’s great autograph, in which the point of the surname i is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for the end of the “automated division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based”.
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long sequence of letters C, G and A written in a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters, or nucleotide, as the scientific definition used by the artist, Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are genetically equivalent and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretations,” Dewey-Hagborg says.
DNA tells countless stories, of which 30 are on display here.
The last work of the exhibition is in his own room: a page from the comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
Manning's character emerges from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
If they can silence you, they have won,” the picture reads.
Never be silent.
The text is from a letter I received from Manning,” an artist from Philadelphia says.
It’s so impressive that I still get cold colors.
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he is greeted with a face based on his own genetic data, like a crowd of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height equal to his length (157.5 cm).
The face used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring the crowd to them,” Dewey-Hagborg says.
I wanted to describe the mass movement that was created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release.
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are being sought for murder as suspects
Police say they have launched national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University suspected of stabbing a man to death in a chicago luxury apartment.
The Cook County Court documents show that Monday was the subject of arrests for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local press release published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27.7.2017.
Police officers alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with several cuts in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing was investigated as a murder.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of Social Relations at the University, said in an e-mail that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping in the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
In an email from the University and a spokesperson from Somerville College, it is stated that “we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in every possible way.”
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Information Officer at the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly urges suspects to surrender to the authorities.
The police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly refining our search,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities help in the search for suspects.
He told the police that he had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment in 1008.
The police described the scene as terrible.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras had revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” says Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Executive Board issued the following statement to the residents: “The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.”
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," the judge said to the police.
Moffatti must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, aggravated harassment.
According to the police, the staff of the bookstore alerted them on 23 May.
According to the staff, the man had "threated to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims".
The suspect left the shop after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for intimidation.
The threat was not related to the events of the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore, the police spokesman said.
I am not an anti-Muslim, I am a Catholic," Moffatt told the police in interviews.
As a penalty, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay £620, i.e. about 690, and £85, i.e. about 95, to the victims.
According to a spokesperson at Scotland Yard, many hate crimes are not reported.
We will complete the actions outlined in the WADA roadmap in the near future” – Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the WADA Roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency to restore Russia's RUSADA mandate.
Some of the road map measures have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA's powers. The second part of the Roadmap was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to the bend, it does not contain anything that is of concern to Russia.
Everything has been announced, and everything is being implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future,” he added.
One part of the road map, however, requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly approve the results of a study by WADA, commissioned by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Mutko said: “The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes, and we cannot admit something that did not exist.”
Mutko’s words echoed the statement of Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov, who spoke earlier that day to the Russian sports media RSport, admitted that there have been problems with anti-doping games in Russia. “We have said several times that there are controversial statements and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally,” he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to cease doping control in Russia in November 2015, after the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organisation was on the “right path” towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation sceptical about Finnish beloved innovation: "there is no evidence" of the health benefits of maternity packages
The British organisation suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian report that Lullaby Trust, an organisation that fights collusion deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in the UK.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package would reduce the risk of cot death.
Sudden death means the unexplained sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust is the UK health authority's expert on the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed into them, as it would suggest that we recommend this product, the organization announced.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to Lullaby Trust, good reading in Finland is the result of many different reasons, such as a low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that each family is given a box may be one factor.
But that cannot be said for sure,” said Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and cot deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and it has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of items, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard for sleeping in cardboard boxes.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best option for sleeping if there is no cradle or cot available.
It is recommended to use the package only for daytime sleep and to stop using it when the child is able to turn around.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of the package and making sure that they do not get wet or dirty.
A quick villain escaped from a Japanese zoo for a second time
The staff of the Japanese zoo are looking for a fugitive turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and escaped within two weeks for a second time.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo via the main entrance.
It doesn’t die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we’re very worried,” said Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55 kg and about one meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is free to enter the farm area.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness sightings of the turtle.
The last run of the villain happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your business avoid Uber’s mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he asserted that the surveys were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
Surveys were simply neither consistent nor objective,” Errett says. His hair care company, Madison Reed, focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new HR start-ups have entered the market to help other companies find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement, allow companies to conduct surveys and target specific teams and population groups, and provide anonymous reporting services to their employees, and in some cases, direct contact with the top management past the board.
Your own health can be monitored with applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company’s Fitbit?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years, and he says that he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can be used to make quick surveys and votes for specific teams, as well as to draw up a map out of which departments the employees are most dissatisfied and which of the managers have received the weakest estimates, which has allowed Errett to drill into the core of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow the workplace culture so that they don’t become the next Uber. There has been a stir around the transport company since a former employee wrote in his blog about the culture of harassing employees and punishing those who talk about problems.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry that, according to Let’s Talk Payments, can reach more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Located in Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a startup that helps businesses detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation was hit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make custom queries, collect responses confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously via SMS.
And if there is reason to suspect that the manager is wrong, the complaints go directly to the board of directors of the company.
Public opinion has overturned the authorities,” says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued in court.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25 000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily access the headquarters.
In the past, it used to be that if an employee wanted to report a problem, they had to first find out the phone number or email address that could be used to report the problem to the head office.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” said James Vitrano, Legal Director at Ruby Tuesday, who said it was difficult to follow the complaints made by the employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from managers working in another city or state. Now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay can be detected and treated more quickly.
I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive view of the reality of the employee,” says Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from litigation related to employment relationships.”
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement even more seriously after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activity in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only with the help of social media that companies realised that they could no longer prevent public scrutiny of their dirty laundry.
Hope was used as a strategy before technology came to control ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by private equity investors, and both Glint and Convercent are supported by private equity investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are no surprise, given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they give their time to a genuinely useful company.
Employees are more committed to the success of a company if they enjoy being heard and their work is rewarding,” says Nina McQueen, director of LinkedIn, responsible for employee remuneration and well-being.
Investors get a return when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they are of interest to investors.
According to workplace culture experts, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on that basis.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if there is no change quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to have four thousand discussions,” says Russel Raath, CEO of Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on collecting information.
If the company does not take action, the employees begin to wonder if they were heard.
And does their opinion matter?
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently carrying out staff surveys on a monthly basis and is able to tackle the problem the same day it is announced at Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slow pace of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help improve the long-term sustainability of its employees in an industry known for its high turnover.
If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,” Vitrano says.
If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of concealing his naked female neighbour, the news agency TT says.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at her home when she noticed a phone hanging outside her window at the end of a cord.
According to the woman, the camera on the cell phone was photographed in the apartment.
The woman who was frightened of the incident had run into another room to dress up.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the mobile phones had been pulled up first, but then recalculated in the window shortly afterwards.
A 20-year-old man suspected of plotting has admitted to photographing a woman.
However, he claimed to have only photographed a woman's face.
The video described on the phone had been deleted and the police had failed to return it as proof.
In the interrogation, the man admitted the act, but refused to commit the crime.
He was justified in saying that he loves his neighbour as "all crazy".
According to news agency TT, a man is charged with the case.
Teachers demand more lya in autumn negotiations
Wage developments cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but the gap should be narrowed,” said OAJ President Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public-sector holiday funds highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the possibility to enter into agreements that do not involve holiday allowance cuts in any way in the review.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only be concluded once the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ’s terms of employment have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets were not yet revealed by Luke.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of the Jukko Association of Public Sector Educated Negotiators.
Luukkainen: Holiday allowance cuts increase differences in earnings development
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that purchasing power of public sector employees weakens while private sector purchasing power increases.
According to Luukkainen, temporary holiday allowance cuts will further aggravate the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, the number of students per teacher may be determined
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between those who are best and weakest are constantly increasing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are declining, and the differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins players' day lengthened as the NCAA reduced daily practice from two to one
A group of UCLA American football players have been left to talk on the other side of the campus's new training fields.
Some have stripped off their shirts, and their backs shine from sweat after the first day of the training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of conversation is a noon break.
After three hours of training at the university, students return to the dorm to read the final exams. The next morning, they meet at half past seven in the Wasserman Football Center.
The next three days will be tough for these guys,” Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday shifts to Tuesday.
The goal of the change was to lighten the workload of the players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three exercises started at around seven o’clock in the evening, and it was hard to find space for the players already in full schedule.
Limiting the number of training sessions to one per day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the six-year Westwood Coaching season in Mora, when the training sessions are held at the same time as the summer courses.
Exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparations for the season opening match will begin: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supported the change in the rules of the NCAA, even though it made the schedules of the players even tighter.
We put a lot of pressure on them for three or four days, and that’s very challenging,” Mora says.
But the players are ready to work. They are great friends.
I think the situation will be easier when we get to Saturdays, and then we will have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp. It is not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and the Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the protective net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players are supposed to move to the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
We have security arrangements,” Mora says.
The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises on video from there. It’s not an exaggerated concern.
The video described in the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We will do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much about it.
We have a plan.”
Freedom to Rwanda
On Friday, a presidential election will be held in Rwanda, Central Africa, the winner of which is already clear.
Paul Kagame officially pursues his third term, but in practice he has influenced the country’s leadership since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagema has been criticised for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused of misrepresentation of poverty statistics, for example.
For the third term, Kagame will be able to make an effort because the Constitution, which limited the presidency to two terms, was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly respected leader.
In his time, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in the unification of a country divided by genocide.
Rwanda’s success has prompted many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kage has promised more freedom to his people after the land has been lifted up.
It could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by intensifying fact-checking
Facebook intends to send potential fake news to more and more independent fact-checkers and present the results under the original article, the world’s largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using an updated machine learning tool to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact-checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news, and many believe that fake news contributed to the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has emerged in a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombarded with fake news before the May presidential elections and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in Germany that a fact check will be conducted in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
People want to see which stories do not pass through the screen of independent auditors, and they also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightenedly what to read and share,” Sara Su, the product manager of the Facebook news feed, wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the Related Articles feature and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Book of Comics: The Story of a Castle
The small Scottney Castle in Kent County is now known for Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it. Now, this charming castle in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moped-haired writer who is fond of old documents.
I think it’s great to be able to study a text written by a dead person over 300 years ago,” Rhodes says with disgust.
I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand.
Rhodes' A Castle in England tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first archive-based book by Rhodes. In 2014, he published Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in a letter. The letter was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 1700s,” says Rhodes.
It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at the time, fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives!"
The author, who was attracted to the old documents, lived in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which felt too good to be true.
He spent days exploring the Victorian “new” castle, archives, treasures, and rarity, such as hanging on the walls of hyena heads and bottles in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with forest guards, gardeners and sometimes with artists who illustrated the book.
In the evenings, he “takes whiskey and begins to write.”
Scottey's closer history is quite unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff was just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking everything extra to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, and maps of who owned what. “You could imagine that land disputes are boring,” Rhodes says. “Here, however, families fought for even one birch.
It came to mind that we should not be allowed to do so already.”
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer, which tells the story of a man who, shortly after the castle was completed, joined the English Peasant Revolt in 1381.
The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex book mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380,” Rhodes says.
The English peasant revolt began in the same area, and it came to mind that the revolt could begin with a riot.
Perhaps these events are interrelated?”
Other stories in the book are closely linked to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, a story of a priest hidden for seven years by the Darrell family during the Reformation of England.
The Smuggler tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 1700s, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family in Scottney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite rogues. They were constantly owed and bought things they could not afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old women, whom I see as handsome friends who knew how to groom the heirs.”
Rhodes is now looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about the Hill of Life, a sanatorium in the early 1900s, where only a eutrophicated plot remains.
Scottney Castle has a special place in his heart.
It was sad to leave,” he says.
I would not have wanted to go back to this evil everyday life.
Relations with Russia Worst since the Cold War
The alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think one can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in Eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to ensuring that tensions do not reach their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Prior to Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump said that the US-Russia relationship had even reached a dangerously low level.
Trump urged to thank the poor inter-country Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko ends - rematch against Anthony Joshua fails
Vladimir Klitschko, the long-running world champion of professional boxing, will finish his career.
Ukrainian Klitschko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who struck gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, played professional 69 times, winning 64 of the matches.
He held various World Cup titles between 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two matches of his career.
Tyson Fury scored him a point in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at the Wembley Stadium and lost in the 11th round after a ferocious match.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to face in a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klitschko did not find any motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match, Klitschko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitschko's reasoning for the decision on the video.
Klitschko's manager Bernd Bönte said in a press release that the decision to close was difficult for Klitschko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision," said Mr. Bönte.
Klitschko has been in contact with American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple have one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former world heavyweight.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of the various federations at the same time.
The Finnish weather squirrel spells conditions: "Take away from the mood"
The pole jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer’s outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken away the woman’s feelings.
There are also unstable conditions at the World Cup in London.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The circumstances have been this summer against the pole jumper Minna Nikka.
I don’t want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I didn’t even get small poles to move properly,” Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and practiced here, how many times I have never experienced such a varied wind in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmi in Games.
This season it has been very difficult to standardise the jump, as there have been so unstable winds in the exercises," Nikkanen said in the Kaleva competition.
The weather also spoke on Thursday in London.
It has been quite challenging to get the technology together - whether it's cold-squeezing or what.
It has been cold and windy, and it has taken away the feeling.
It makes no sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
He made it to the 455th World Cup thanks to his jump in the hall.
445 people have gone outside.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be calm and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed Friday’s qualifying 460.
Why don’t you train abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technology stabilized.
I should have done the same now.
Normally the hall has been practiced, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal weather for the race?

An experienced ex-official disgusted politicians with Yle: "We have no room for division now and for many years"
Despite the favourable economic climate, Juha Sipilä’s government must keep ice in its hat and be wary of the government’s budget escalation with debt money, Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance, warns.
According to him, there is no room for division.
Yle interviewed about the retired Virta in 2015 on Wednesday's 1st morning.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, politicians’ proposals for raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting electric bikes, among other things, are being discussed by Virtanen as election speeches.
They mostly tell us that elections are starting to be close, because when ten per cent of the state budget is funded by additional debt, we have no room for allocation now or for many years.
I think it is even a fraud to talk about a payoff when debt is taken, Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt is owed to children.
Virtanen has long experience in the preparation of state budgets: he joined the Ministry of Finance in 1978 as Budget Secretary and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Head of Budget.
The last time he retired, he served as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
Virtanen pointed out in an interview with Yle that the projected three per cent economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a thorn that we will start to lower next year, and Finland expects an increase of one per cent for decades.
Washington changes the rules of permanent residence
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, the Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and restrict family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and who have the skills to benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Danish Queen's spouse does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
The picture shows Prince Henry and Queen Margaret in April.
Queen Margareta of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, are not buried next to each other, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the pair of monarchs in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the court notes in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is the Prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the Prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy," said Lene Belleby, Head of Communications at the Court of Appeal.
For the prince, the decision not to bury him alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not treating him as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the Queen has long been aware of her spouse’s wish for a burial place and understands the decision.
A moment of horror on the road: The car was coming on top of the highway
Tom had a cohabiting partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but they will not receive any money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The accident took place at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive picture of the Ring III construction site.
According to Tommi from Vantaa, his family survived a miracle in a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his cohabiting partner Riina and the couple’s two small children drove on the motorway at Keimolanportti in the direction of Hämeenlinna in Vantaa.
From the junction of Ring Road III to the Hämeenlinna fairway, a white car was driving along the acceleration lane to the side of the family car, says Tommi.
Without the evasive movement, the car would have come on top of him.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, says Tommi.
The family car crashed into the railing at a high speed.
The parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little under 3 years old, the other under one year old.
It was a good luck when we didn't have anything.
No one passed us, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident took place around 17.20.
According to Tommi, no one stopped with them, and the family called the emergency room.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel arrived and the family was checked.
The car went into rescue condition.
Tommi says that he and his cohabiting partner have a low income, and they received a grant from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family does not receive any money from the insurance.
This is why the family wishes eyewitnesses to observe the car, which is why the family drove to the railing.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children to the garden and go to work without it, says Tommi.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
In his opinion, the start of the registration number of the car was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don’t know how we’re doing financially, we still have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen or know something about it will be in contact with the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had the task at the accident site on Tuesday evening.
The title and corrected at 21.15: Contrary to what was originally reported in the story, the other car did not enter the lane of the arrivals, but was driven from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
The performance, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with human relationships by means of humor - The self-exhibitor will be seen at the theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, who is from Kouvola, brings her first directing to the theatre What?.
The self-exhibitor is a musical theatre performance about past relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good mood.
The subject is dealt with by humor.
There are no bad feelings left, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been carried out with a small budget and a big, young heart.
The name of the performance challenges you to think about what a person reveals about themselves when they get to know a new person.
Maybe he's playing a role or is another jacket coming open?
The plotless presentation confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the working group’s texts and there is no plot in it.
The director believes that while the performance draws from the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the self-exhibitor does not directly tell about his or her own or the working group’s relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
My own values will certainly be conveyed by the performance.
I don’t think that relationships are bad, but I also don’t think that a relationship, especially a relationship, is a prerequisite for happiness.
Many people learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-exhibitor draws an up-to-date picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of one hundred.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
There is no need to stay in a bad relationship.
The performances include Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
Music adaptation is Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love for the theatre broke out in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, studies as a theatre director at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Academy of Arts.
There are two years in the back and one in the front.
Jäppinen’s enthusiasm for theatre has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The music class has been raised as an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has performed at the Ylioppilasteatteri in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnateatteri in Turku.
Steering has become more and more interesting.
The self-exhibitor premiered last week in Helsinki on the scene of Narri.
In the future, a performance of about 45 minutes will also be seen at least in Jäppinen’s study city in Turku.
The self-exhibitor at the Who? theatre in Kouvola on 4.8. at 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
Finnish Olympic winner recovers from motocross accident for a year - neckline fractured
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural force as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of the bickering toured the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtila movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a Kemijärvi resident would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, says Lahtela.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahti completely.
In 2014, Lahti was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, her neckline and both hands were broken.
I was not in any job.
I licked wounds in my home for a year, says Lahtela.
There was bad luck in Lahti.
He also admits that age could have played a part in the accident.
Driving on a bike can sound furious.
But I did not apply for borders.
It’s just so hard as a sport that it’s not worth having too much for a 40-year-old like this!
After the accident, Lahtela faced a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long start in Japan as the head coach of the freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the position immediately after the end of her own career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be there.
I didn’t really do much, says Lahtela.
Even during his training, Lahtila often challenged his protective equipment on the slope and in physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that my own thoughts did not seem reasonable.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I really just got to be.
A mandatory break inspired Lahtila to become Finland’s main coach.
Without stopping, he fears that he would have burned out.
It is easier to find places in your body that have gone through than intact!
Without the accident, I would not have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby in place of speed sports.
I changed my motocross to frisbee golf!
He left right away.
At worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela herself has always been a super enthusiastic trainer, she does not require her coaches to be the same as hers.
I do not force everyone into the same mould.
Our species culture has room to be unique and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, says Lahtela.
Sex robots are coming and we need to be concerned
It’s here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry – just when it started to feel like 2017 can’t get any stranger.
Yes, yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
We must begin to take the generalization of sex robots seriously,” says Noel Sharkey, founder and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
Sex robots are being giggled, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them,” Sharkey said at the launch of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and AI-created features similar to human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to his preferences from eye color to nipple shape and fingernail type and color.
All the more worrying is that the robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford’s women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the preferences of the user, for example, shy.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
Roxxxy Gold’s personality adapts as fully as possible to the user’s personality,” the company’s website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
For example, it can be tired, in the wind of talk or “in the wind”.
There are many worrying features of sex robots becoming more common, replacing genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subordination of women and the outright rape fantasies as the user approaches, for example, a robot that is programmed to be shy and objectionable.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot on its website with a vibrator:
Women have a vibrator. Why should men not have a sex robot?
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new type of sex toy.
Their generalization and development indicates something darker and deeper in our culture: the recession towards gender equality, where subjection is one option among others.
Of course, most men don’t get a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report reported that they are growing in popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many will only begin to behave strangely or offensively when the market permits it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots are becoming more common at the same time as women's rights are under threat around the world and the White House is sitting with a president who has bragged about harassing women.
The Handmaid’s Tale is not the most worrying imagery, for example pictures of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short distance away.
Sex robots try to do as much like real women (with porn star proportions) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel genuine and movements to mimic human movements as well as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
The robot is unable to leave the relationship or situation.
They have no will or history of their own – nothing that suggests independence or that violates the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Handmaidens.
Police suspects that two acts of terrorism were planned in Australia, led by the head of ISIS
The head of the extreme organization Isis led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb to the aircraft of the company Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a member of Isis' leadership had also sent building blocks to Sydney.
According to suspicions, the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the company was suspended before the security check.
The police do not explain in more detail why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device that excretes toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, for example, a public vehicle.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also continue.
The good things about Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like heir to common sense
During the Trump era, it has been repeated to the extent that the strong dichotomy of voters at the everyday level has also broken up families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspaper advisory board provided guidance on how to deal with people who voted for Trump.
We all want to break our information bubbles.
Less attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to unite families.
I will tell you about this because my cousin visited me in New York this week. He is a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been a button against the Republicans of our family.
He pointed out that a common enemy could have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousins – including a Republican-friendly sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but more broadly, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new boost, but the perverse influence of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and ‘normalization’, we talk about the fearful possibility that one day we will no longer be able to frighten his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more horrifying possibility that Trump is normalizing the Republicans on the far right, who suddenly seem to make sense compared to Trump.
I think of Mitt Romney's subdued version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and his tax returns we've seen). Compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild violations.
When the Trump era is over, the next Republican presidential candidate only needs to be clear-sighted, and it immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Central Park Carousel, which is the biggest carousel in the New York Park and the best thing they can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
The horses of the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle – grotesque clowns and animals looking back in horror – are ominous, and the background of the roaring music is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s hallmarks become disillusioned over time: the views of the tall buildings begin to get bored, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar, and the city’s reality does not match the dreams.
After 35 years, I have not completely overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a large roundabout in Northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss pub, but it does not count.
The carousel of the Central Park, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience – even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven years old and two forty-year-old women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week in a department store to rate my “payment experience” on a scale from one to five stars before putting my credit card on the reader.
The same thing in the café at my home corner, but I am also given the opportunity to combine the 15% service allowance with the estimate when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service staff to put their person in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store's saleswoman smiled with regret when I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter - "There was no trust in the management"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq from the duties of a representative team coach.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who previously worked as an assistant coach.
The other coaching group will continue in its current positions.
Italian Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach in, for example, the English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter coaching team, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, is sorry.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club's management, and there was no other option now," Håkans commented in the club's press release.
The Piccareta Agreement will remain in force until the end of the period.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he will be responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to Ilta-Sanomat, the team has been stunned on Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen had been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a strong lead in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a picture of adolescence in the 80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
The violinist Linda Lampenius posted a picture of her youth on Instagram.
Several Hästags have been added to the picture, on the basis of which it can be concluded that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman who looks seriously at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he sends a message.
If the image does not appear, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
Just over a year ago, she posted a couple of photos of herself on Instagram.
In the second picture he is seen 20 years ago, in the second he is posing now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius contemplates his own growth as a human being and refers to the eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I’ve learned to like myself and what I look like,” Lampenius wrote.
After the text, she had added in English the hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, self-esteem, self-esteem, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is neat.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
He was already at the age of 14 because of anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which was only finally revealed in 2006.
The healing started slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius delivered from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital.
Last year, she received hospital treatment for incisions on her wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, she suffered after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following the prosecutors' appeal against the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have thought of his girlfriend as a night intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to complain again because they consider the six-year sentence of Pistorius to be too mild.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may already be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not applied in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians illegally encamped in Greece were arrested, according to the country's Foreign Ministry's bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unlicensed campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1st. Two Bulgarians were among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced the release of the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on anyone who camps outside the designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry stated that the right may impose a fine.
The stock of liquid sinks - already sinking -7.7%
The share of Neste, the oil refiner, has fallen by 7.7 per cent around 11 a.m.
Its profit before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
Today, the stock exchange trade has started on the side of the cold, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the stock exchanges opened, the large European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange, OMXH, had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trading, and the most traded companies, OMXH25, had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total turnover of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which EUR 9 million was the result of the morning publication Neste.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid in protein, tryptophan, helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, the leader of the study, immune cells guard the gut and ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation balance the cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, then the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The studies found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are present in mice with a specific bacteria in their intestines.
This bacteria needs tryptophan in order for immune cells to start to appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
We found a link between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and the development of tolerance cells. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbiome of the gut,” explains Professor Colonna.
The more tryptophan was present in the mouse diet, the more such immune cells were present.
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
When studying immune cells that strengthen tolerance, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not found in mice of the same species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to microbiomes in the intestines of mice, i.e. the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the gut DNA of mice was studied, six bacterial species were found in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice in a sterile environment who did not have intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluid – without bacteria – from mice to immature immune cells.
The immune cells evolved into cells that strengthen tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When scientists doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice’ nutrition, the number of tolerable cells increased by about 50 percent. When tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barrangan, humans have the same tolerability-enhancing cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether Tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria can develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, Tryptophan-associated genetic defects have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines,” says Cervantes-Barragan.
A high level of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their proliferation.
José Mourinho believes Manchester United got a “genius” in its ranks after signing a contract with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a “genius” in its line after signing with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder made his debut in Manchester United’s line-up against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
The £40 million left Chelsea for Matic to win 2–1 in the last match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impact as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
Matic, however, was not in the best shape yet, as he was not on a blue shirt tour in Asia until the start of the season. He only managed 45 minutes on the pitch – according to Mourinho, a change must come before the start of the Premier League season.
He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has the natural ability to think football,” Mourinho says.
We help him to be ready rather than later.
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also about to start the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting line-up for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club has already done a “great job” by acquiring three of the four players he preferred.
Three out of four – you have to thank the club for that,” he added.
I’m happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job.”
Volleyball women bullied Germany for two rounds
Finland’s women’s national volleyball team lost their fourth World Championship match directly to Germany in 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany has a high standard of routine gambling.
Their game was smooth in every sector," Tapio Kangasniemi, Finland's chief coach, said in a press release.
Finland kept its opponents tight in the first two rounds, but Germany was clearly stronger in the third round.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to play with them,” Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most efficient was Piia Korhonen, who had collected 14 points.
Three out of four games lost Finland will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Major jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russia
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges to meet Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to meet with Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin links.
Reuters, a news agency, confirms the announcement of the convening of a large jury previously revealed by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges to the meeting of Trump Jr. and the Kremlin Liaisons, Veselnitskaya, which was held during the US presidential elections in June 2016.
Donald Trump's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington means that the pace of the investigation into Russia is increasing.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to help investigate Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether the Trump campaign or his close associates cooperated with Russia.
The Grand Jury expands Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on oath.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The large jury weighs the evidence the prosecutor has investigated and decides whether to prosecute the case.
British inventor microchips himself to get to his home and car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor is the first in the whole country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, now offering a service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam’s BioTeq technology.
Northam collaborates with Geoff Watson, an anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets the medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as the cat and dog microchips, and it takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam’s attempt to make house and car locks compatible with the microchip will also cost £300 to handle one lock.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
White House exhibits cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House for an event presenting American production cost taxpayers $24 000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on board. It was the main attraction of the White House on 17 July 2017, where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials visited the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter built in Connecticut, there was also a sailing boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to be deployed on a mission-specific basis only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an “extraordinary” event, as evidenced by the naval HMX-1 helicopter squadron’s documents.
I just wanted to make sure you’re aware of it because it’s an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility,” the HMX-1 unit commander wrote the day before the event in an email to his manager, who is an assistant commander of a naval flight.
The message was that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grassland on 17 July at 7 a.m. and the event would begin at 3 p.m., and the helicopter would only leave the site after the grassland was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter was to leave the White House, another crew would be deployed due to restrictions on service hours.
The original crew was in the helicopter for the duration of the incident, and the security staff of the unit were at the helicopter when it was in the ground.
The documents received by TIME did not determine whether another crew was eventually needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked whether the incident violates the law.
One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told that there would be no violation,” the commander wrote.
It sounds like you can participate,” the assistant commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political hues.
At the event, the President spoke in favour of the health care reform that was then being discussed by the Senate, as well as a looser state regulation.
The use of a Marine One helicopter and an Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
They must be used by the presidents on their journeys,
But their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the presidential campaign in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased American workers' products made from American materials from all 50 states,” said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The crews of the HMX-1 regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice bringing the President to the White House on the southern grass field with the accuracy of centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to an official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
On that day, 11 hours of “non-presidential support missions” were also flown on the helicopters of the unit.
According to the White House, there were no other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky spokesperson said that the company was not involved in the presentation of the helicopter on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have a record of flights related to the President’s duties, and it is difficult to estimate the exact cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence’s hourly compensation for 2017, the compensation level for a VH-3D helicopter is $24 380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantico base in the state of Virginia to the White House and back took a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
The calculation of taxpayers’ costs by level of compensation is misleading,” Walters says.
The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called immersion costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.”
According to a 2015 study by the RAND research company, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but they take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the incident, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopters at the event.
The idea is to introduce American production,” Spicer said.
I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and thereby employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is entirely appropriate to bring it up.”
It is not certain whether Trump went to the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat down with the fire truck driver.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
I know Sikorsky very well,” said the President, “I have three of them.
Lightning hit the Vaasa railway - trains have to be replaced by buses
Passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is broken due to a technical fault, says the Finnish Rail Transport Agency.
For now, trains will be replaced by buses.
The fault in the traffic control system was caused by thunder.
In the morning, the railway traffic centre did not have an estimate of the duration of the repair.
Venezuelan state prosecutor calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that last Sunday's election will be held on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative body was elected, which could, among other things, change the constitution of the country.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, a blocking decision has been requested due to suspected election fraud.
Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation.
He appointed two judges after the British company that held the representative vote announced that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated to the council, and the elected 545-member council includes, among others, Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the Representative Council may dissolve the Congress led by the opposition and amend the laws.
Maduroa described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the amendment of the constitution to be Maduro's way of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new delegation.
Maduro argues that the new Representative Council is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
Many people have been wounded and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela plunged into an economic crisis after the fall in oil prices.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to speak out on Friday, when the new delegation is due to begin.
Russian man handed over by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the US court sentenced the 41-year-old Maxim Senah to four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a US request.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he returned home.
Finland handed Senah over to the US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian objections, AFP says.
In March this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud for the benefit of millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is deported after being sentenced to prison.
Russia's foreign ministry denounced Finland harshly after the arrest and said that he should not be extradited to the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were criticised for having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The fraudsters then used the data by continuing to control internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Acting Director of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also capable of targeting cybercriminals operating in other countries.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.

Third season trailer for Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of print, so the Cali cartel will be the main part of the Netflix hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in Narcos' second season, the Netflix series is certainly not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that there will be a third and fourth season of the series. The trailer for the third season has been released and introduces the new villains of the series.
In the third season, the US drug police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the richest drug trafficking organization in the world.
The organization led by the four godfathers operates “like the Fortune 500 company” except that there is a little more corruption and violence by the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently announced trailer, Pedro Pascal returns to Javier Peñana, who recruits US and Colombian policemen for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional light art work in Paris
The lighting artist Kari Kola from Joensuu (Kuavssa) will carry out an exceptional light art work in honour of the first Light Day set by the UN in Paris next May 16.
Kola makes a light artwork called Day and Night in Paris.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - the sun and the moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO headquarters of the Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it.
With my work, I want to highlight not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, the light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make things that I feel are important more visible, says light artist Kari Kola from his work.
I am very much invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was present at the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO headquarters in honour of the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to recreate my art at the UNESCO headquarters,” says Kari Kola.
The work may still expand significantly.
This will be announced later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise people’s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first day of Light will be celebrated at the UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fought in the shopping centre’s parking garage in Espoo
There was a dispute between two men in the shopping centre Iso Omena parking garage in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when the other party accidentally drove in the prohibited direction.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
A driver driving in the prohibited direction would beat the driver of another car, as a result of which the car started running and crashed into the hitter's car.
He then hit the hood of the crashed car.
In the preliminary speech, the man admitted that he had caused the damage and had done the wrong thing.
From Timo Soini, a question-marked inscription: "Then came the Flood"
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (Uv.) published a blog post on Thursday, which is titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to the government party of thirty-seven parliamentarians.
Then there was the flood, now everything is floating, Soini writes.
Soini’s text contains references to the French of the eighteenth century.
Madame de Pompadour, King Louis XV or his lover, is known to have used the flood comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, the words "after us the flood" or "after me the flood" have remained in the books of history.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
Elections are only representative if they allow all members of society, including women, to vote, said the head of the UN Delegation to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim head of the United Nations Relief Mission, said that hundreds of women were nominated for the provincial council elections, three women were running for Vice-President, and more than 30% of the newly registered voters were women.
The role of women cannot be overemphasised,” Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully in them and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5.4.2017.
The Taliban have presented threats to elections while international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contributions strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

Flooding of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The rage of the locals is directed especially at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and fleece" tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and then rushes through the sights in large groups.
Venice is suffocating tourists who make quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are hard to move around and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further away from the innermost centre, while the hotels have replaced their homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems brought about by tourism in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, you will be given two or three hours.
You follow the guide from Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the current and problematic tourism of Italy's Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of places, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most visited sites of the historic centre of Venice.
St. Mark's Church is located on the edge of the square.
Local indignation is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
The historic centre of Venice is home to only 50 000 locals.
In 1951, there were about 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2 000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving the inhabitants away.
About 2 000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years time there will be only tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organising the demonstration.
The equation is difficult because the vessels bring the income they desperately need to Venice and create the need for numerous jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it has been planned that cruisers would go to a distance from the centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, would certainly change the situation if the administrative district of Venice, where Venice is also located, were to have more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Around 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
On the motorway, severe congestion of kilometres
On the north side of the highway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, there has been traffic congestion of kilometres from Thursday afternoon’s work during the return traffic.
The area is covered by motorway coating work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For road works, there is a 50 km hour speed limit instead of the usual 120 km hour speed.
Even in the 50-kilometre restricted area, however, traffic had progressed at a walking pace in some areas on Thursday afternoon.
Roadwork progressed on Thursday afternoon on the Siilinjärvi side of the Apocalypse, i.e. the golden deer.
I get along well without such attention
A 23-year-old runner has been exposed to public cursing.
Amalie Iuel has published some great pictures of herself, including in the Grand Canyon landscape.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian, has risen in her current homeland, Norway, to make recommendations as an athlete, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre run by running 51.81 at the time of the race.
A month later, he improved the 400-metre hurdles at the time of the Norwegian record 55.38.
Soon after its record, Iuel, who uses social media, found that fame and publicity have their drawbacks.
Men around the world began to send pictures of their genitals to Iue, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "smudge pictures" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into private," Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You can guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the race, but I get along well without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
When Amalien was 12 years old, his family moved to Namibia, then to Pakistan, because of his father's work.
It was followed by Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, she changed her Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is trained by three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don’t ask for anything, they just issue orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in the fence race.
The foot injury took the snowboarder Janne Korvi to the entire career - now participating in the World Cup: "It's nice to not hurt anything"
Now it has been nice to count when nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has been able to enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, the continuation of his career was at stake.
The leg strain injury had forced the Korpo to the operating table in January, and the leg did not want to heal.
The hand had also taken a hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I didn’t know what to do, whether the boarding would continue or not.
Sponsorship deals were broken and many things were open, Korpi says.
But so it is said that things tend to be arranged.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw again to the slope.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew that no later than when I first went to the snow.
I was so damned, this is so much fun again, let's take a couple more seasons.
It was not until September-October that the raven landed properly, but after a long period of pain-free training it has been a big thing.
There are only a few races around Korpi.
It doesn't matter.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korvi.
I have never counted for one race.
I think it’s frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you’re in a fever for that week.
I can't think that way," says Korpi.
Today Korpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though the individual races do not like him on board, he always lights up with the hard company of racing.
According to Korvi, the recognition of the International Ski Federation competitions has increased over the past few years, even though some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important competitions, the visibility is big.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the circumstances and level of the competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the Finnish 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The team’s helms, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkisenniemi, are Korpea 14 years younger.
It's nice to watch younger friends go.
I remember when it was at that point that everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It will bring a new stream to yourself, says Korpi.
I still keep up on the slopes, but otherwise I don’t, there’s that much going on with my friends!
In the background of his boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of the director legend Pekka Korve is addicted to race racing: the rider has his own race horses for which he makes training programmes.
When I’m on the road all the time, there’s no time to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at at least the results of the race and usually some kind of start, says Korpi.
According to Korvi, trotting and trotting coaching are a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end.
I don’t plan that far, but it’s at least a likely option.
I feel like I’m studying it in addition to snowboarding.
I try to stay on the nerves of time and develop, maybe in the summer I’ll be driving something.
If it is my future profession, then it will not be difficult to start when you are already inside the sport.
The trotting events also include the Elitloppet race cruise with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet race.
Korpi and Linnanmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has become a great deal, and people have been excited.
We are already at a point where there will at least be no bankruptcy.
There is still a few months to go, let's hope that the ship will be full," Korpi says enthusiastically.
Attendo’s care home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new 41-seat care home for older people to be built in Kitee.
A good 1 700 m2 building will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighbouring Health Road.
With crystal, the general question of wonder is where the new care unit will be enough for the customers, because now during the Siun sote, many private care homes are suffering from a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Director of Care Services, commented that Kite will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing in the future.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kitee, Kanervikkola and Eerikka.
The transaction concerned business, but the property is reportedly a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations out of these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie’s in Scotland
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the directors of the McVitie’s biscuit manufacturer of a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish section of the British General Trade Union (GBM), the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products have more than 500 employees.
The company Pladis, which owns the McVitie’s brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will be “certainly told first” if there are any changes in the operations.
In a letter addressed to the plant manager, GMB calls on the company “to respond to the concern that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of production lines”.
GMB trade union Drew Duffy is very concerned that the factory manager will not be able to provide clear information about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plans.
Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow, a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low incomes.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income, and the continuous reduction of Brexit, rising living costs and production, East Glasgow needs successful McVitie’s production badly.”
According to a spokesperson for Pladis, the factory manager had only received a trade union letter the day before, and the company responded directly to the letter because it appreciates the constant interaction between employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of GMB at Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of questions openly.
Among other things, we discussed with our employees that, like other companies in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we continuously evaluate all our businesses and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness.”
According to the spokesperson, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, especially in its production lines and in improving its operations.
We are aware of Tollcross’s long history as an establishment and will be sure to be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we intend to make changes to the operations of the factory.”
Did PSG Barcelona warn of the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret interest Marco compared
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's efforts after paying £ 189 million for the termination of the contract. But did PSG Barcelona warn of a record move three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most talked about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half lower: it was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for a transfer of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, as PSG will provide him with more than £500 000 a week’s salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious at the activities of PSG and the way in which Neymar left the club. A source close to Barcelona says that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the chairman of the PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif warned PSG's best players clubs.
I’m not worried because they know that if they’re looking for our players, we’ll become their opponent and contact their players,” Al-Khelaif said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they are looking for our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: it expressed its interest in the midfielder Marco compared earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar.

NOW: Trump-sanctioned calls were invented - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that the two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never took place, according to the New York Times.
Trump's calls with both the President of Mexico and the leader of the scouting organization have proven to be invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had taken place.
He said, however, that Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the leaders of the scouts spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had spoken at the G20 in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations took place, not just on the phone, but face-to-face,” Sanders explained.
Speech to the scouts provoked disapproval
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president called him and praised Trump for successfully eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few people will ever cross the southern border of Mexico because they know that the journey will in any case fill the U.S. border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government issued a statement saying that there was no such call.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump spoke at a major meeting of a national patrol organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the patrol boys, he said it was the coolest speech ever made to them.
They were very grateful,” Trump said.
On Wednesday, a patrol organization announced that it was not aware of any of its leaders' calls to Trump.
According to the press release, the former statement by the leader of the organization, Michael Surbaugh, in which he had asked for Trump’s speech to be forgiven by the patrols, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the meeting of the scouting organisation was a source of great surprise, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn’s presidential elections.
