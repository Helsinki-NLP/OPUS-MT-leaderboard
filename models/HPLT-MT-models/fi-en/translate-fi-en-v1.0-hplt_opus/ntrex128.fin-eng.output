Members of the Wales Council are afraid of looking stupid
Some members of the council are confused about the proposal to change their title to MWP, which is a member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was the beginning of a plan to change the name of the House of Representatives to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Representative Council, regardless of party affiliation, are concerned that the change may bring them to ridicule.
According to a member of the Labour Party, the group is concerned that the name "frogs with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
According to a Plaid party representative, the majority of the group “is not satisfied” and has proposed other options.
According to a conservative party representative, his group is "open-minded" about the change of name, but points out that the word MWP is a short verbal leap from a stupid word.
In Welsh, the letter ‘w’ is pronounced in this context, similar to the letter ‘U’ in Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Representative Council, which is currently working on the legislative amendment needed for the name change, stated: “The final decision on the titles describing the members of the Representative Council belongs, of course, to the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 empowers the Representative Council to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the appointment of a representative office as the Welsh Parliament enjoys broad support.
The Commission favoured the appointment of members of the Parliament of Wales or the acronym WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
Members of the Representative Council are apparently proposing alternative titles, but a lack of consensus may cause a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments includes other changes in the activities of the Representative Council, such as rules on the loss of representative office and the form of the committee system.
When dealing with legislation, the members of the Representative Council can give their final vote on the title under which they should be called.
Macedonians go to the ballot box in the referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its EU-NATO membership aspirations.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia has said he will ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of a referendum such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that the name change is simply a price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's watches are quiet as Harlem churches live in difficult times
The elderly people I have been talking to say that before there was a bar or a church in every corner of the street,” says Adams.
Today, there is neither.
He said that the loss of bars is understandable.
He said, “People’s interaction has changed.”
The bars are no longer the common living rooms of the neighbourhood, where people meet regularly.
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property will not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the square of departure."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments, which people living in are not the ones that would support the remaining shrines in the neighbourhood.
The absolute more people who buy housing in these buildings will be white," he says, "and so they will have a day when these churches will shut their doors once and for all, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black community - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church moved away in the 1930s.
The nearby black church acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by the black church under the leadership of pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on the 125th Street in Harlem, the central commercial street, against the alleged recruitment or promotion of blacks.
The fire that broke out in 1939 severely damaged the building. When Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they introduced a tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and follower of St. Martins, proudly called the tower bell game “the bells of the poor”.
In July, the tower bell game was called by an expert by another name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this was the world’s first tower bell game played by black musicians, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger tower bell game at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins did not replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex skein involving architects and contractors hired by the church’s lay leaders and the Episcopal Diocese.
Sakasti - a governing body of the church's lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese "would try to roll the cost" to Sakasti, even though he had not been involved in recruiting the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some church members complained about lack of transparency in the diocese.
Hai injured 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while he was diving lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was just excited to catch the lobster, but then realized that he was shouting, “I was bitten!”
I was bitten!'
After reaching the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire clavicle had been torn open.
I shouted everyone out of the water: There is a shark in the water!” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was reportedly critical.
The species of the shark that attacked is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at the media conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
The authorities closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty departments where expert advice is provided.
This is a major move in the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow despite the decline in sales of fashion and household goods. Larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's says its beauty products portfolio will double to 3 000 products, which include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific areas like the boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-launch its range of boutique make-up products. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as it is increasingly demanded by young shoppers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop’s perfume chain is testing rental stores in two Sainsbury’s stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and switching to small one-time shopping in local grocery stores forces supermarkets to come up with new incentives for customers.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will look even more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, as well as Habitat stores.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's experimented with the joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds of supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy follows a transaction in which Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skin care products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve customer service.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands meets all needs and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us a compelling beauty destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones "Furious" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones went out “rave” when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home accessories and accessories brand Truly.
The two companies have been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of this Morning programme announced her departure on Instagram.
Hollywood Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute, and he is now going to focus on his new giant deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “furious” at last Tuesday’s tense meeting at Jones’s business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new £1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their home accessories and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was speculated to double Willoughby’s estimated assets of £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, “Truly was by far the most important project for Holly.
It was his long-term plan to secure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone in amazement.
No one had faith in Tuesday's events so close to the publication.
Marlow’s headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.”
This Morning host is one of the UK’s most secure stars, and according to experts, his departure can cause the company millions of losses due to product investments, including everything from pillows to candles and clothing to home accessories, not to mention the delay in publishing.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby organized Capp in Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones took over as president in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones owns 40% of the television production company in Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the new brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity TV.
A source close to Jones said the night before, "We are not commenting on his business."
Tight talk and then we fell in love
He joked about criticism in the media of his comments, which some would find inappropriate for the president, and his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, pretending to be a news anchor.
I did not give up at all.
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had praised the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, nuclear negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see a "comparative response" from the United States to the early disarmament efforts in North Korea.
Instead, he said the United States would continue to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
North Korea is great,” he said.
We were heading to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.”
The efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results. Missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom, and American soldiers' remains have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
It’s very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get out into this crowded hall with 10 000 more, we would have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of us.
Indonesian tsunami and quake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign voluntary organisations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency required for international aid was not declared, although about 10% of the residents of Lombok had been left homeless.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging,” said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is a group that travels back, it is not certain that foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesperson for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations were allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face the forces of nature, taking into account the frequent earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The return was likely to result in the loss of lives due to the missing tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was valid.
Travelling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging even in the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the Lombardy earthquake is on its way to the return, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new area of disaster.
President Jo Widodo made the development of Indonesia’s past infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign, and he has spent money on improving roads and railways.
However, there has been a lack of funding for either government, while the new elections are approaching next year.
There are also tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Christian and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with jungle knives, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons. This has resulted in the death of more than 1000 people and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sunk a late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League on Saturday after painting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from the Chelsea goal, while his team was in a losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before scooping a shot towards the back post.
The shot hovered high over the penalty zone towards the upper right corner.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
I just tried to make myself play to get players like the ball and Shaq playing as much up as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanten approaching, took one touch and started without thinking too much.
Chelsea led the match at halftime with 1-0 Belgian Eden Hazard painted in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave the heel feed to Mateo Kovacic before he ran away near the midfield and spurred to the Liverpool half of the field.
Kovacic played a fast wall feed in the midfield.
Then he released Hazard to the penalty area with a fantastic pass.
Hazard fled the defence and passed Liverpool with a left-foot shot from Alisson Becker to the back corner.
Liverpool will meet the Champions League in a block stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 15 a.m.
Chelsea meets Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15 in London.
Indonesian tsunami deaths rise to 832
The Indonesian disaster agency reported early Sunday that the number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami increased to 832.
Sutopo Purwo, a spokesperson for the agency, said at a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves up to six metres high.
The fragments of the collapsed buildings spread widely to the city of Return, with 380 000 inhabitants.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding a dead woman
A woman's body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside in the morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 a.m. by Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for the murder.
The police will ask people in the area to register if they have seen or heard anything.
Crime Commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on a dashboard video to contact the police. They may have vital information for the investigation.”
The female spokesperson of the police has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, a woman’s possibly familiar with the crime scene has come to ask about her place of discovery.
As the investigation continues, the police report that they are trying to inform the victims of the incident.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he knew what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it can take hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared at the scene.
He repeated that "it's terrible".
In the afternoon there were two huts in the isolated area, and outside there was also a third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who supervised the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something will be asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers 0800 555 111 anonymously on September 30, 247.
Parliament's Cromwell statue became part of a rewriting business in history
The eviction of the statue would be a poetic right, given that his own fanatical puritanists destroyed England's cultural and religious monuments like the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of the statues would be a target for the statue of Oliver Cromwell, on the front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or implement the English Civil War iconoclism.
The wrong Cromwell might suffer from the actions of his predecessor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell reflects the opinions of the nineteenth century and is historical evidence of a figure that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, although perhaps more than today in the nineteenth century, consider Cromwell to be Parliament's defender against external pressure, which in this case, of course, caused a monarchy.
Whether or not it is an accurate description of the subject is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the mid-century dispute has shaped the later development of our nation, while Cromwell must be recognized as a figure representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a steward deserve praise and remembrance.”
Killing pig slams Chinese farmer to death
Local media reports that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him in a market in southwest China.
Only the body of a man identified with his last name “Yuan” was found near a pig farm in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou Province. The man’s artery was broken and he was in the blood above, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig herder is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly travelling with his cousin from nearby Yunnan Province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door to a nearby pig house open.
In the pig house, he said he saw a large roar with a mouth in his blood.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed the lives of a 250-pound roar farmer.
Guiyang Evening News reported that a cousin called “Wu” said “my cousin’s legs were bloody and bruised”.
The surveillance camera image appears to be coming to the market to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm others when the police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs are known to have attacked people in the past, although this is rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig of almost 300 kg wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to exterminate the animal.
After the event, a farmer living in Manitoba told CBC News that although the pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of the blood can act as a ‘trigger’.
They are just playful.
They are like babies, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
They just have to be properly respected,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to deteriorate as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring floods to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa had a wind speed of 38 meters per second, that is, a first-class hurricane, on Sunday at 5 a.m. on the east coast, and it was located 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure is emerging over the Pacific Ocean, heading east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa enters the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical humidity northwards towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa brings up to 250 millimeters of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Afterwards, the tropical moisture interacting with the approaching low pressure will form large rain areas in the coming days to the southwest.
Locally, 25-100 millimeters of rainfall cause dangerous heavy rain floods and potentially landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity in certain deposition areas causes 50-75 millimeters of rainfall per hour, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 50-100 mm of rain is expected in certain areas in the southwest, especially in Arizona.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can quickly deteriorate due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the event of a tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers and thunderstorms cause local gusts of wind and flying dusts.
The approaching low-pressure zone will bring local heavy rainfall to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfalls of more than 10 mm are possible, resulting in small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rains of the rainy season in the region.
Fragmented tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains spread over Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, the United States will be able to see all-round strong fluctuations in temperatures as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
In the central part of the United States, there is an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and between Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
The lingering heat of the summer will once again aim to intensify and expand in the coming days.
From the beginning of October, it is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with a temperature of +26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, the temperature can climb to +26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, there is good potential for higher than average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Tuesday, over 20 million people watched a six-channel broadcast in which Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexual crimes in the 1980s, gave her fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as the broadcasters stopped broadcasting at the last minute, according to which the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations on the basis of an agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Legal Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh was intoxicating him and was trying to take his clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, made an emotional witness statement in which he said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
The number of viewers is likely to be higher than the 20.4 million announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Figures from other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers who watch in offices.
Some proportions indicate that the reading corresponds to the number of spectators in an American football playoff or an Oscar gala.
According to Nielsen, the highest number of viewers were on the Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
Flake was at the heart of Friday's drama.
CNN's and CBS's cameras described how the protesters' cries led him to the elevator on the way to hearing the Justice Committee on Friday.
CNN showed a straight line of how he stood for a minute with his gaze down while the ringings were flying.
I stand right in front of you,” said a woman.
Do you believe he will tell the truth to the people?
You have power when so many women are powerless,” he was told.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and added before the elevator doors closed that he would have more to tell after the committee had been consulted.
Hours later, the cable and broadcasting networks were sent directly when the Legal Affairs Committee began voting on the nomination of Kavanaugh for the Senate plenary vote.
Flake, however, said he was acting only in the sense that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was convinced to be part of the conversation with his friend, Democrat Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
The choice of Flake had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the FBI into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit policy
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May blames those criticising her EU exit plans for a policy that threatens Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls for a proposal that Britain and the EU would inherit each other's import duties, "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson for suspected death of LSU player
Police have arrested a person on suspicion of shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball in LSU.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and is accused of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the investigation between Sims and Simpson, in which the police report that Sims lost his glasses.
Police found glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
The police report that Simpson has admitted that Wayne was shot in interrogation.
According to Advocate, his guarantee amount was set at $350 000.
A preliminary report was published on Friday by the East Baton Rouge County Cause of Death Investigator, according to which the cause of death was a shooting wound in the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Inspectorate, State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police, and the residents of the area for assisting the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement authorities for their “excitement and exercise of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the match last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that he was “horrified” and “stunned” by the death of Wayne.
You’re always afraid of something like this happening,” Wayde said.
The volcano spits ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the Mexican Centre for Disaster Prevention urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater's activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash discharges were registered during the day.
The centre registers the rumble and vibrations several times.
On social media, pictures were published in which a thin layer of ash covered car windscreens in residential areas such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysics have seen 72 km southwest of the capital increase in volcanic activity since Mexico was shaken by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists come together before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona in a confrontation between independent protesters and riot police, and thousands participated in the first anniversary of the dissenting vote.
The police arrested a group of disguised supporters of independence who threw the police with eggs and powder paint, which formed dark dust clouds in the streets normally filled by tourists.
Over the course of the day, more skirmishes broke out as the police used their batons to restrain the mellows.
The clashes between the supporters of independence and the Unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting “no forgetting, no forgiveness”, and the latter “Long live Spain”.
The local press reports that 14 people have been treated for minor injuries during demonstrations.
The tension is still on the surface in a profitable area one year after the 1st October referendum, which Madrid declares illegal, but which is celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was a low difference in the boycott of those who opposed the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in last year's violent clashes when the police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
On Friday, independent groups stayed outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it had to go another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of Catalan independence.
Last year we experienced one of the best moments in our lives.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we are stuck in place,” he says.
This year, despite the sharp but vital victory in the regional elections last December, the pace of the Catalan independence-loving parties has waned. Many of the prominent leaders are in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a pro-police demonstration on her phone, says politicians on both sides have stirred up controversy.
The situation is getting tougher all the time,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in custody since last year, announced his participation in next year's European Parliament elections.
Becoming a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the crumbling and oppression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash in the house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was reported to have repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The events took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 a.m. UK time.
Police officer Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car could also be shot with a crossbow.
Livingston defeated the Rangers with a 1-0 Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston secured victory
Series climber Livingston astounded the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second loss in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was ultimately enough to win Gary Holt's team as they split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew were left without the first guest victory of the season in the Premiership, and next Sunday it will face the series leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
The Rangers still face Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston continued his lossless streak in the series for six games. Holt, the chief coach, has not lost a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places against a visitor suffering from a lack of a blade
Holt's team should have led long before their goal, causing the Rangers serious trouble with their straight line.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish was wide, and Alan Lithgow was able to slide in front of the goal to Craig Halkett's butt feed, but steered past the ball.
The hosts gave in favor of ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate in special situations.
An important goal came this way.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga, where he was able to move the ball to the middle of the penalty zone and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball until then, but said that the home team's defence would hold, and there was little to try on goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced the fight against Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's attempt and Lithgow passed the ball in one more special situation in Livingston.
The concentration rained on the Livingston penalty area was constantly cleaned out, and two situations were also called for a penalty kick - after Halkett had tackled the changeover Glenn Middleton and a ball hit in the hand.
Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing through the upswing.
The team's playing style and crew have not changed much since it rose back to the highest league level.However, Holt must be recognised for the way in which he has strengthened the team once he has arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worall on their toes for the entire match.
But the Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has performed really well under Gerrard from time to time, but was far from his standards.
The final pass was exhausted and they only managed to open the home team's defense once, which should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are the middle of the league table.
Erdoğan received a mixed reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, the purpose of which is to correct relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements on human rights and freedom of the press as well as on Turkey’s EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police prevented 25 000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but a lot of supporters were gathered to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters - many of whom were Kurds - also brought their voices to light, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Some German Turks greet him as a hero while others insult him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
The cyclist died when he came across a car in London.
The accident occurred around ten o'clock in the southwest of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, with busy traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and the medical staff came to the aid of the victim, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Children's Street, about one and a half kilometres from Saturday's accident scene.
The city police say they are trying to identify a man and inform his family.
There are roadblocks in the area and bus traffic has been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials say six prison guards have been injured in the high-security prison unrest of men.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at about 9:30 p.m. on Sunday and continues.
Special Tornado police officers have been brought in to calm the unrest, behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
The minor facial injuries of the police were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: “HMP Long Lartin prison has been sent to specially trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken care of by the police and they may have to spend longer behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
The prison director was reported to have been hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, in October, riot police officers were sent to prison for serious unrest, in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rain floods to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas can benefit)
There are rarely tropical low pressures in Arizona, but that is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week, when Hurricane Rosa’s remains will move over the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rainfall.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rain flooding on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, as well as to the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in its tweet that “only ten tropical hurricanes have preserved the tropical storm or low-pressure state 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict rains of 50-100 mm. On the Mogoll ridge in Arizona, it can rain up to 150 mm in some places.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, 25-50 millilitres are likely to be obtained.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing in a drought-stricken area if there is no risk of heavy rain flooding.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can be useful, as the southern lunch has suffered from severe droughts.
According to the U.S. Department of Droughts, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first makes a landing on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico. At that time, it is still a hurricane with a wind speed of 135 km/h. It moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm loses its power as it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico during a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rain can be severe and cause a significant flood risk.
From the California Peninsula to Sonora, it is expected to be 75-150 millimeters, and up to 250 millimeters is possible,” says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in tropical low-pressure Tuesday morning hours. From there, she will continue her journey through Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday night.
The biggest risks associated with Rosa or its remains are associated with very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, North-West Sonora and the US Southwest Desert,” says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rainfalls are expected to cause severe flooding and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested attempted murders
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4 a.m.
He was taken to a hospital where he was told to be in a ‘steady’ state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area in Avon and Somerset during the night.
The police will ask for contact from anyone who may have video material stored on a mobile phone for events.
Trump says Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party "nasty and indignation"
The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and shameful methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been suffering from the “nasty and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also proved his allegation in the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s excellence, character and courage that day.
The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time, who has excellent merit in public service,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The President implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when speaking about the importance of Republican voting activity in the mid-term elections.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
Not just campaigns, but campaigns to the full,” he said.
That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for excellent candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats had taken on the task of “opposing and preventing”.
A senior member of the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process is expected to take place in the Senate by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of deaths is expected to rise
On Saturday, the authorities reported at least 384 deaths from major earthquakes and tsunamis on Sulawesi Island in Indonesia.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the shore of the town on Friday, when waves up to six metres high hit the shore at dusk. Many washed their lives as the waves destroyed everything from their way.
The tsunami was caused by 7.5 magnitude earthquakes.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, leaving them as its victims,” says Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson at the Indonesian Bureau for Disaster Relief in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it pulled cars, tree trunks, houses and struck all over the country,” says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami reached 800 km/h on the high seas before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster agency show several destroyed houses and shops, warped and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released on Friday's massive earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the terrain of a city long and narrow bay could swell the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as “extensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that the bodies of some of the victims had been found in the ruins of the fallen buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 had been missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage may be greater than 300 km north of the continuous coast, the area called Donggala, which is closer to the centre of the quake.
Communication connections are “completely broken and no information has been received from Donggala”, says Nugroho.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300 000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not saying that the tsunami hit the return, although the authorities said the waves arrived during the warning.
A man on the upper floors of a building in a video shared on social media is fervently shouting warnings about the approaching tsunami for people on the street.
Only minutes later, a water wall hits the beach, taking buildings and cars away.
Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the image.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The authorities say that the army has begun to send assistance from Jakarta and other cities by means of transport, but evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has only been reopened for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President either Widodon was due to visit the return evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
The situation is really bad.
Donggala staff at World Vision have been sheltered in the town of Palu, where they have been accommodated in tent canopies in the office’s courtyard. On their way, they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is really bad.
As aid teams began their inconsolable mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were prevented from travelling back.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only begin to flow once an accident area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
This is still a provincial disaster,” says Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As long as the government says, “OK, this is a national disaster”, we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made.”
When the second night landed on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the missing people entertained the hope that their loved ones, by way of a miracle, would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was lifted from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach for the Indonesian suspension team, had coached two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, says Mandagi.
As a senior member of the hang glider, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Gendon says he has been struggling to reach out to Palu’s competitors at the beach festival with WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of Roa Roa hotel spread among the hangover community.
However, only one grey sign appeared after the messages he sent instead of two blues.
It means, I understand, that messages were not delivered,” he says.
The thieves took $26 750 to complete the ATM at Newport on the levee
On Friday morning, the thieves took $26 750 from the employee of the Brink’s security company when he was completing the ATM in Newport on the levee.
The driver of the car had been in the process of emptying and completing the ATM in the entertainment centre,” says detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
When Brink’s employee’s attention was elsewhere, “behind him ran your man” who took a bag of money to deliver.
According to the report, eyewitnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Individuals with information about their identity are asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Saturday, he wrote, "The character who was once known as Kanye West."
Ye has been the name of the 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album, released in June.
The change precedes his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the program, withdrew her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word also has religious meaning for him, in addition to being an acronym for his professional name.
While discussing the album’s name earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, “I believe that “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and there it is “you”.
So I am you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form, Ye - which only expresses the goodness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The album is mainly about who we are.”
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Also, West’s former partner JAY-Z has sometimes removed and restored the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
The Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, and the announcement came as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, promised that he would “never use an army to oppress the Mexican people.”
The armed forces fired on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly study grants and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence research
The U.S. should double its funding for AI research when China is making its industry more efficient, according to Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI expert at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by notifications of AI in various parts of the US administration, although the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become a leading AI developer by 2030.
A doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” says Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee’s book “The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a publishing house that works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China’s most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which outperformed the highest-ranking Othello player in the United States. He later served as head of Microsoft Research and head of Google’s Chinese operations.
Lee acknowledged previous US government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers worked hard to get public funding.
Academic influencers are not driven by China, but by large corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to intensify its AI efforts.
I think that those with a PhD in AI should be automatically issued with green cards,” he said.
China’s Government’s next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industry and academic partners, and the White House has also announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
NSF invests more than $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the initiative to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in referendum to change the name of the country
In the Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to the “North Macedonian Republic”. The name change would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has hindered the country’s efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
According to Greece, the name of the northern neighbour is, in practice, a territorial requirement for its territory and has therefore objected to its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new draft name, but the nationalist opponents felt that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the voting turnout will reach the required 50% limit in order for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying the price so that Macedonia, which has risen since the collapse of Yugoslavia, can seek membership of both the EU and NATO.
I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia to live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievsky in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have said they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 13:00.
However, the voter turnout was only 16, compared to 34 per cent in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, at which point 66 per cent of those entitled to vote voted.
I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum on the name change of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed the chairs in front of the boycotting tents in front of the Skopje Parliament.
We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join heads up, not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, as part of Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
I believe that a large majority will vote in favour of a name change because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after his vote.
He said the ‘yes’ voice is our ‘preparing future’.
The poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday referred to a 30-43 percent voter turnout in the referendum - that is, below the required turnout.
In a second survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for the yes option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the voting turnout must exceed 50 per cent by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the Western-style government after it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero defeated the entire Brighton defence with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear impression on Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made his goal look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentine top player was given a pass from the midfield.
He found an empty space in the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one of the defenders and then left behind several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty zone.
He then found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch inside the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton guard with a shot in the right corner of Mathew Ryan's goal.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that “Aguero has problems with his feet.”
We talked about playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
Fortunately, he scored in that time.”
However, Sterling had already given the sky blues an advantage in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in 29 minutes of play.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took some contact before sending the ball to the back post towards Sterling.
The sky blue striker slammed the ball into the net just before the end line.
The City meets the Hoffenheim Champions League in the block stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoiler in a match against Rockies
Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why try to get started?
However, Scherzer always hopes to take over the pitch in the Sunday match against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff seam. They have a one-win difference with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the western league.
Rockies won at least a wild card with a 5-2 win on the National Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
Even if we don’t have a stake, we can get up to the pitch, knowing that the crowd and the other team’s atmosphere here in Denver is creating the most demanding competitive scene I’ve faced this year.
Why don’t I want to take up the challenge?”
The Nationals have not yet released their start date for Sunday, but are, according to data, inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity in these circumstances.
Scherzer threw out a training session on Thursday. He would play his 34th game at the start of the game and feed on Sunday with his normal rest.
The right-handed player in Washington has a 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. The ERA statistic is 2.53 and he has burned the batter's nest 300 times, with a turn-pair statistic of 220 2/3.
Trump Campaigns in West Virginia
The President implicitly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh, who also spoke about the importance of Republican voting in the mid-term elections.
All our achievements are in play in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the great things -- not just campaigns, but campaigns to the full, and that's why I'm going everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this horrific, horrific group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to return to power by any means, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don’t choose who they hurt or who they need to bully to get to power, that they want, that power and that power, but we don’t give it to them.”
He said the Democrats had taken on the task of “opposing and preventing”.
And it has been seen in the last four days,” he said, calling the democrats “angry and mean and malicious and false.”
As he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-running Democrat in the Senate Judiciary, the audience responded with loud bouncing.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Eh, eh, what.
Well, oh no, I expect a little - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It will not tolerate those who say their opinions
I’m not really surprised when my local party’s Momentum activists supported a motion of censure against me.
After all, I'm finally just the last Labour representative in the queue who is told I'm not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated in the same way only because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Labour Conference at Nottingham East stated on Friday that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the eight years I have been a local Labour representative, the Friday size of the party council has been just that.
Now, many meetings do not follow that tone, and a more “friendly and gentler” policy has long since been forgotten if it ever started.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party will no longer tolerate dissenting opinions, and that each opinion will be judged on whether or not it is appropriate for the party leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I had thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect me to be fully translated and to make statements that I would otherwise never have agreed to, whether it be national security or the EU internal market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - the result is an avalanche of insults on social media, which calls for my choice to be withdrawn, a rejection of the central policy, and I get to hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my own experience.
I know I’m really more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have received are of a political nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist abuse every day and never waver.
The normalization of abuse is one of the most disturbing features of the policy of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour Party adopt a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with each motion of censure or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years, I have been told to keep a low profile and to refrain from expressing my thoughts so that “everything will go well”.
But that is not the reason I left for politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the neglect of Thatcher’s government’s unitary school, I have tried both as a city councillor and as a minister to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I have never hidden my political line, not even in the last elections.
No one in the constituency of Nottingham East has been surprised by my views or disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that hinders households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on questioning my confidence in the Labour Party leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with respect, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr at the Blockhead
Two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr certainly won the day in the entertaining Tennent ́s Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team in 10 that has not lost any matches.
After all, a great defense and more successful risk-taking was what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can rightly be satisfied.
We have been challenged in our matches and we are still invincible, so I can be satisfied,” he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, “All the credit to Ayr, they took risks better than we did.”
At 14 minutes, Ayr took the lead with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, surrendered by Warriors to the match, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo raised Ayr's leadership with a penalty goal, and just before half-time he scored and succeeded in the conversion kick, raising Ayr's leadership to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which, in a conversion kick, Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr grew his leadership with the goal of Stafford McDowall, which Climo succeeded in the conversion kick.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine scored a goal after heavy pressure, which was not a conversion kick.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to tackle the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored a goal at the back of Ayr's Maul, who left the side line.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe scored David Armstrong and helped Gregor Henry finish the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game Series Star Starts in the Restaurant Industry
Still Game Series star Ford Kieran has been named as the head of a licensed restaurant company and should start working in the restaurant industry as well.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, which he co-wrote with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public register information, he has been registered as director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the Scottish Sun magazine source hinted that Kiernan wanted to be part of Glasgow’s thriving restaurant business.
The sea belongs to us”: landlocked Bolivia tries to regain access to the Pacific Ocean through legal action
Sailors patrol outside the naval base in La Paz.
The flagpoles of public buildings bear the sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been flagged: “Justly, the sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In the inland Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 1800s is still strong – as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades when Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
Bolivia has a strong faith in progress, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, a positive attitude towards the final solution,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A number of Bolivians across the country are following the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screens, hoping that the Hague will support Bolivia – after decades of debate – for Chile’s obligation to grant independent access to the sea in Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic president, Evo Morales, who will face a controversial battle for re-election next year, has a lot to play in next Monday’s policy.
The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in the interest of Bolivia, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The United Nations institution of Dutch origin does not have the power to transfer Chilean territories, and the ICJ has also declared that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision is issued only six months after the last statements suggests that the case is “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than furthering Bolivia's intentions.
The current Bolivian regime has hijacked the question of the sea connection,” said Zárate.
Morales' challenging rhetoric has stifled the goodwill of the rest of the Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations after that.
There has been no embassy in either country since 1962.
The former president and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally swift.
Monday gives Bolivia an “exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end the 139-year-long dissent with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of the most popular Latin American presidents, had used the maritime issue as political support.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past.”
North Korea has announced that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can rely on the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington," North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States of the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Ri's statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a “far away dream” to believe that continued sanctions and US opposition to the Korean declaration of war would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant measures to promote disarmament, Washington is alert to the adoption of the Declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to abandon the arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has gained widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcasing the large headgear of the latest collection, which will soon be on your street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue searching.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 show a selection of special oversized headgear that dazzled the style circles of Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical headgear took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino’s most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feathered brim that almost completely covered the ends of the models.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of unusual masks – just before Halloween.
Many colourful masks had stitched their lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than top fashion.
One of the creations with a snorkel and a mask was more like a diving instrument, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you got lucky.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves are appearing on the street.
The oversized hats follow strictly “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a half-meter brim, seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult renown of the impractical hat, which is abundantly seen on social media, also contributed another large creation to fashion shows – a beach bag made of straw, which is almost as large as the model carrying it.
Burnt orange reed-edged raff bag with white leather hand straps was the most striking creation from Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the street picture next summer – designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for global citizens
Traditionally, the learning outcomes of private schools in Scotland have been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of the good test results, which have been enhanced by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30 000 students are located across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), and aim to provide a high-quality service to their students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen career, postgraduate and higher education, as well as for world citizenship.
As an operator in the field of education who can design and implement tailored study content, we have noticed the role of languages as a popular and desirable subject in continuing education institutions.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak in a language that he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his or her own language, the message goes to his or her heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to establish relationships of trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we find that languages are at the top of the list for the pass rate among private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
The data were collected from 74 CIS schools, and found that 72% of students who received the highest grade of A, 72% studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French, and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are considered to be of the same value as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school curriculum and elsewhere.
Based on a survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it was found that 17% of situations where an employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee were explained by lack of language skills.
Therefore, the development of language skills is even more necessary for the promotion of future career development of young people.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more relevant these skills will be in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he/she will have an advantage in the future for this lifelong skill, regardless of which career he/she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts the language-oriented person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, more than 4 000 UK adults were unable to speak in a foreign language, and French was the only language known to a double-digit number of 15%.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Especially the knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
A number of schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are likely to be important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite your child’s interests, there are always several language options taught by specialized teachers in private schools.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
In this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be seen as “international communication skills”.
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and a high level of education for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS)
LeBron makes its debut on Sunday in San Diego
LeBron James's first appearance in Los Angeles Lakers' ranks is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego before the season starts.
But the number of minutes he really plays remains to be seen.
It’s going to be more than one, and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
James, who followed the drills, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the six games to be played before the Lakers.
At this point, I no longer need pre-matches to prepare,” he said.
Trump West Virginia Campaign Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will launch an election campaign today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic items such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote awaits his election to fill the vacant seat of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to increase support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing a majority in the November elections.
What time is the Trump West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling event starts at 19 o'clock on Saturday 29.9.2018.
You can watch the Trump West Virginia campaign online as a live stream via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is likely to comment on the hearing of this week's Supreme Court judge-designate Brett Kavanaugh, who became hot on charges of sexual harassment, which have delayed the Senate's confirmation vote even during the week when the FBI investigated the charges.
But the primary goal for the series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tight November elections.
As a result, President Trump’s campaign was commented on for the next five weeks with the aim of “awakening the voluntary and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and in the House,” according to Reuters.
Managing the Congress is so essential to his purpose that the President is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign season,” the anonymous representative of the Trump campaign told Reuters.
Today’s venue is the Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, with supporters from even “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican West Virginia presidential candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in the polls.
For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows fighting will to keep hope alive before Sunday's singles game
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon doubles were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sport, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where, according to them, is this power of success at the moment?
They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we take this power of success as a nub,” said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 points to be played.
Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind on the sails and a lot of what to encourage, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas, who helped them play all day together and score three out of four points.
Spieth has been a powerful brick for the green, leading by example.
The hoarse throat sounds of the winning party intensified as his round progressed as he managed to level the match to four, while he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
Putta, with whom they won the 15th match, was followed by a similar cry that gave the impression that he believed that the US team had not yet lost.
You have to concentrate really well and take care only of your own match,” said Spieth.
That’s the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have scored more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special but sweet duo has won four of the four wrongly.
Moliwood was the only duo to do no bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this raucous audience, confirms that they are the Sunday's favourite. And when the sun sets in Le Golf National, there could be no other more popular player to make a profit in Europe than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time with different holes.
Talks about Europe's success are premature, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated the paired Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the morning's four-game.
One bog and two double bogs in the first nine holes dug Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they were nowhere near to survive there.
However, on Sunday, no one will help you out of the pit.
Four-ball and four-player are fascinating to follow from the point of view of cooperation between couples: what kind of advice they give or not to give, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and took a significant lead before the last day, but this four-game showed that the U.S. team has a will to fight, even though it has been suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in good lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup after they took the lead in Saturday's four-balls and four-balls from the United States.
The brilliant duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the victory over the two-win Tiger Woods, and scored a point balance at four points in Le Golf National today.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to preserve the victory he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the weakly played US team in the four-ball of the morning, taking the match to 3-1.
The United States were a tougher opponent in four-game winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's half needed eight points out of Sunday's 12 singles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also known together as “Molliwood”, were the second duo to win four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup after a sensational weekend.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, they then finished with an even more vigorous effort of 5-4 by the overwhelmingly discouraged Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, who barely survived through the two matches on Saturday, was at times very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-ball, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested with the four-balls in the morning, but returned to doubles with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third in the ranking.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to the southwest.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the US with two points on Saturday.
They won a sly 2-1 win over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball, and later 4-3 wins over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a four-ball game after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has risen from a four-point chase position to levels at the start of the singles, although a draw on Fury’s side is enough to maintain a win.
However, having been the second best of two days, it may be that the Sunday counter-attack is too much to ask for.
North Korea “in no way” disarms itself without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant positive measures” over the past year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the site of nuclear tests, and promised that North Korea would not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States,” he said.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so in such circumstances, it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally.
Although Ri reiterated the familiar lamentation that Washington did not accept a phased nuclear phase-out in which North Korea would be rewarded for every issue, his statement must nevertheless be marked in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely ruled out, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement given by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12.6. In the statement, Kim affirmed “the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has made an official effort to end the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States is calling for “nuclear disarmament first” and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force – even by opposing the “peace declaration”,” Ri said.
The notion that sanctions would bring us to our knees is a wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party calling for disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such a deadlock.”
Still, Rin’s tone was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing missiles towards the US mainland was inevitable after the “bad president” Trump called Kim a suicide-intentioned “missile man”.
Last year, Trump threatened to “destroy” North Korea. However, this year, Trump praised Kim for his boldness to approach arms abandonment, but stressed that there is still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions must remain until North Korea abandons nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that “the strengthening of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be strong and without failure until we witness a full, final and confirmed cessation of nuclear weapons.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up its sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of halting Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile financing channels.
Pompeo met with North Korean Ri at the UN General Assembly and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the most recent visit did not go smoothly.
When leaving Pyongyang, he described progress, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea pledged to close the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States takes “similar measures”.
According to Pompeo, Kim means the “similar measures” of security guarantees that Trump committed to at a Singapore meeting, and the move towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate rest instruction course
This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University will take part in a course aimed at increasing student rest. The course is a counter to the university’s thriving macho culture, where students weigh a long night with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite unaware of the basics of their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medical sciences at Harvard University who works in sleep research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, believes the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, ‘Why do I only hear about it now, in my last year of study?’
No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I thought was surprising,” he told Telegraph in an interview.
This course, organized for the first time this year, will guide students on how the right sleep habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Dr Paul Barreira, professor of medical sciences at Harvard University and vice president of health services at the University, says that the university ended up organising a course after they had heard that students were suffering from severe sleep deficits during the study week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of a dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus get information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second part, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that this does not have an immediate impact on student behaviour.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these things in exactly the same way that they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking,” adds Professor Czeisler.
All night long student marathons are still a matter of pride, according to Professor Czeisler, and modern technology and the ever-growing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Getting adequate and high-quality sleep should be a student’s ‘secret weapon’ against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a condition resembling starvation in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry,” the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical psychology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his first courses in Harvard last year.
He says the course opened his eyes and gave a boost to the organization of a comprehensive course for all campus students.
He hopes that all doctoral students will be able to complete a similar course of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students also set an alarm to remind them of bedtime not only to wake up in the morning, but also to keep in mind the adverse effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on the “blue light” circadian rhythm, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot won by Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers once again experienced another day of defeat when a Dolly Menga shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1–0 victory.
Ibrox players were looking for their first win since February 4–1 against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard only experienced his second loss during his 18-game manager career. The Rangers remained eight points behind the current leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga shot the ball to the finish seven minutes before halftime, and the fallen fighting will of the Rangers was no longer leveled.
The Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game, while Livingston has climbed to third place, and the goal difference is only higher in Hibernian.
The Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game by an object thrown from the guest spectator, and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up by which the team had beaten Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 line-up where the team took the point from Hearts last week. The same strategy was once again successful when the well-built line-up managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to score for two minutes, when Menga's first entry gave Scott Pittman a free way to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then gave his free kick to Craig Halkett, but the other defender, Alan Lithgow, managed only to shoot wide at the back post.
On the other hand, the Rangers took control of the game, but the last third of the game had no more confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos was penalised when, at fifteen minutes, he and Steven Lawless came across each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored Colombian requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily rejected Lassana Coulibaly's butt and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team's hard work.
The Rangers could still do nothing about Jacobs' long feeding tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who coolly scored a ball for Menga for easy goal.
During the exchange period, Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable gap for Morelos. However, the attack broke down Kelly's influence on the rapid defence.
Livingston once again played his own game as Lithgow and Halkett continued to pass long after each other.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their leadership in the final moments of the game. However, McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could reach his position at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came from the change of the Rangers, also demanded a penalty for taking Jacobs together, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Geigermeter inventor
Next page of our “Sunday Morning” almanac: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geigerometer.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and also a central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film “Coronado’s Clocks” in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present scientists who seem to be quite herders:
Man: “What on earth is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geigerometer. It’s used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put your headphones in your ears, you can really hear the effect of radioactive radiation in the minerals.”
Evans: “Look, it’s really ticking now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, an invention that bears his name still lives.
New cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the proteins typical of multiple cancers
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
For example, the cancer cells of an ovarian cancer patient disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells.
In the method, the resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of several cancers. The modified cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, USA, describes the method: “Based on our findings, this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “directs the growth of several types of cancer,” explains Professor Berzofsky. “These include breast cancer and cancers of the ovaries, lungs and colon.”
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West got into the teeth of critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show did not go according to plan
Kanye West got booing on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump in a raging style and announcing his intention to run for President in the 2020 election.
After presenting his third song “Ghost Town” Trump in the Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
Often when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he is racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have changed America a long time ago,” he said.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch where Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Judiciary. The hearing relates to Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of Kavanaugh's sexual harassment.
West's rant was not broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a snippet of it to social media.
It is not clear whether Rock's intention is to mock West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been abused because of his hat on the back of his head.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I should not go on stage with this hat on my head.
I have been bullied!
Then they say I’m on the margins,” West says in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see what it means to be on the margin?” and says he’s wearing a Superman cape, because “then you can’t control what I do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
According to Variety, West's comments triggered booing from the audience at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed. One of the attendees described the situation to the newspaper as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was selected for the program at short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West made many viewers bewildered by wearing the song “I love it” as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPASA, who praised his courage on Twitter: “Thank you for defying the garbage”.
Karen Hunter, the director of the talk show, however, said that West “is just himself, which is simply wonderful.”
However, I can decide NOT to support a person (by purchasing this music or clothing brand or by supporting this ‘art’), whom I consider to support and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free person.
The same applies to us,” he added.
Before appearing on Twitter in the evening, the rapper announced that he had changed his name to “a person previously known as Kanye West”.
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The second rapper Snoop Dogg was also known by the name Snoop Lion, and we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and then became an artist known by the name Prince.
Belfast restaurant staggerer charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore area, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast tribunal on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Kit Harington, the actress of the throne game, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-waving heroic role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series The Throne Game.
Harrington, however, has attacked the macho hero stereotype: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned hard.
In an interview with the Sunday Times' cultural appendix, Harrington suspects that “something has gone wrong” and questions the available ways to address the toxic masculinity in the age of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, also recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, is also a member of the Star Guard of the Throne Game.
The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is currently arousing strong feelings in me,” he says.
What have men been taught in the years of their growth that has led to the problems we now see?
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continues: “What is inherent and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
There is something really wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of the pre or sequel to the Game of the Throne after the series ends next summer, because he has, according to his own words, “enough of battlefields and horses”.
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of the film producer and his bandit brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best that the Throne Game has offered him.
I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on,” she says.
Rose Leslie starred in Ygritte, the love of Harrington's Jon Snow in an Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were inaugurated in June 2018 on the accounts of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects more than 820 000 people in the country.
About 40 000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through contaminated blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
One year later, however, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 cases.
Sexually transmitted HIV infections are an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that 70–90% of men who have sex with men, due to conservative values in the country, eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases are due to insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to guarantee universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies information from the leaked Republican senator and accuses of spreading “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied the allegations that her employees had published personal information on three Republican senators on the Wikipedia website that concerned them.
A representative from Los Angeles assured that the allegations were spread by “extreme right” commentators and websites.
Lies, lies and more defamatory lies,” Waters says in a statement published on Twitter.
It is reported that South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch had home addresses and telephone numbers.
On Thursday, an unknown person released information from the US Congress during a hearing with the Senate Committee on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three Senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that, according to the Hillin newspaper, the messages were published from the IP address attached to the Waters office and by a member of the Waters staff.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and it is an absolute lie,” Water continued.
My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolute lies.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and the critics were also accompanied by Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary.
The way he denies this is very hostile,” Fleischer wrote.
It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There is no reason for defiance.
There is no reason to question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to behave calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters' place in the mid-term elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
Unbelievable if this is true,” he said.
In a statement, Waters stated that he had contacted “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies for these fraudulent accusations.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” he continued, “and that they are legally held liable for any destructive and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff members.”
Johnny English Strikes Again - Underpowering Rowan Atkinson Agent Parody
It is a well-established tradition to look for Brexit references from any slightly tilted film in the UK, but this does not seem to fit the Johnny English Agent Parody and the action comedy series that originated in 2003 with the Johnny English web and resurrected with the 2011 sequel “Johnny English – Reborn”.
Can a tongue-in-cheek nation’s satire become Britain’s new national export success?
Either way, Johnny English, an eye-catching, rubber-faced and incompetent man, has already earned his approval for the second time, and his name tells us, above all, that this is a comic creation directed at a film market outside the English world.
Of course, this is the toll of a secret agent who is desperately trying to breathe the glamorous glamorous glamorous atmosphere around him, but it appears as a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and the unfortunate one-note musician at the London opening concert in 2012.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mysterious world man who left nothing but chaos behind, who Atkinson portrayed in the previously forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last show has its time.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in a medieval armour, and the rotor blades blow at his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy presents itself, but humour itself seems underpowered and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ film brands such as 007 and the Dangerous Mission today offer humour as part of the film’s core content.
Humour seems to be directed at children, and the messy treatment of Johnny English does not seem as inventive and sharp-sighted to me as the comedy of Atkinson's Mr. Bean's silent roles.
Every year, the starting point is that the UK is worse once in a while.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated the top-secret spy network in the UK and reveals the identities of all British agents on the ground to the shock of the agent in service – which is portrayed as Kevin Eldon’s unfortunately small role performance.
This is the last drop on the important and straitened prime minister, who is already in the grip of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does everything in the skins of Teresa May's parody character, but the script just doesn't provide him with enough space.
When intelligence advisers inform him that all the spies on the ground have been revealed, someone must be called in to the emergency, who has already moved away from the active service.
This is, of course, a Tuning Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement as a teacher at a fine school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The subject revives some witty jokes; English holds school of rock-type lessons in the secrets of intelligence activity.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets again his endlessly patient battle partner Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a man with a family, married to a submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to gain his rights.
Thus, the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of his majesty to face Ophelia Bhuletova, the fatal supercriminal played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve British computer problems.
The English and Bough odysseys turn into a farce right away: a pair disguised as waitress sets a fine French restaurant on fire and causes chaos in their secret pursuit of Volta's luxury yacht.
Even the last blockades of the perpetrators will disappear when the final scene comes to an end, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a little bit like it was made for the children’s audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
While watching Johnny English films, I have come to the same conclusion: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
British Labour denies plans for a four-day working week for five days' pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
The party is said to require business leaders to transfer the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three-day weekends with the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of ‘agreeing’ with the party’s economic programme and its plans to lay down policies for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
The source of the high-level Labour Party reports to the Sunday Times: “The statement will be announced before the turn of the year.
The change does not happen in a moment, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party pledged to support a four-day working week in connection with its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective does not receive undivided support in Labour's ranks.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: “The four-day working week is not the party’s policy, and the party is not considering such a transition.”
Shadow government finance minister John McDonnell took advantage of the work conference last week to present his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from “faceless dictators” and “speechers” of non-governmental corporations.
According to the plans of the Minister of Finance of the shadow government, the current shareholders of water companies would not be able to regain their full share, as the government, led by Labour, could implement “deductions” on the basis of perceived abuses.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of private sector companies' share capital to employee management, with a maximum annual dividend of £500 per employee.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss 60 minutes of whether an investigation into Kavanaugh by the FBI could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge. The delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In the 60 minutes on Sunday episode, the programme correspondent, Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
So, of course,” Kennedy said.
I said when I went to the hearing... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the accusations came up, and asked him, ‘Did you do that?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks cut in stone.
I’ve made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it’s a bomb,” he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett vehemently denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
No one named by him was able to confirm this.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which takes place in New York on Saturday, is a musical event with a performing band as impressive as its mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to New York Central Park lawns to listen to performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively working to eradicate poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a political decision-maker or making a call, or some other action that spreads awareness of the project’s objectives.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that there is only 12 years left to achieve this goal?
Is a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘cliticism’ among others – the idea that you can change the world by signing an online address or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen announces that it has recorded more than 19 million “acts” in support of various goals since 2011.
According to the report, these actions have encouraged policy-makers to announce commitments and principles worth more than $37 billion that have been used in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements that have already resulted in more than $10 billion being spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds received have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to “helping children develop to their full potential”. The group committed to deliver $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, which happened after the activists had sent them 4 700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
Thanks to the British government, donors, governments in different countries, and people around the world like you, we can pass on social injustice and malnutrition to the newspapers in history,” said Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition’s ambassador to the public at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the UK government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children through more than 5 000 actions. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project to combat malnutrition, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the website of the movement is: “Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?”
Global citizen’s answer: “The road is going to be long and difficult and many stumbling blocks are in front of us.
However, we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.”
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host a New York concert this year, featuring artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, a country can make energy exports more difficult by using the fleet as a “barrier”
According to US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner, Washington can “if necessary” resort to the help of its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s activities in Syria – at the invitation of the legitimate government – are an excuse for a new energy market in the region.
I believe that the reason for [Russia]’s presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe,” Zinken says.
According to the office holder, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open with its fleet and, if necessary, by encircling to ensure that the energy they supply does not end up on the world market,” he says.
Zinke spoke to the public at an event organised by the Energy Consumers’ Association, a non-profit group that is profiled as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and fuel replacement for the other,” he says, describing Russia as a “single trick circus number” whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements take place in a situation where the Trump administration has sought to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace it with significantly cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, ties Berlin to Moscow’s leash.
Moscow has repeatedly focused on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres of existing pipeline, as a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind the Washington opposition, and considers it to be an example of unfair competition.
I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier,” says Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has caused a reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial umbrella organisation, the German Confederation of Industry, has called on the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I find it very problematic that a third country is involved in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Confederation of Industry, after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Secretary of State from Massachusetts, is going to think carefully about ‘putting forward for the 2020 presidential election’
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that she would “consider carefully” becoming a presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a nomination at an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
It’s time for women to move to Washington and correct our faulty regime, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom,” she said, according to The Hill.
After the sixth day of November, I will carefully consider becoming a presidential candidate.”
During the event, President Donald Trump was judged by Warren, saying, "He is taking the country in the wrong direction."
I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he says.
Warren has been outspoken in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, according to a poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren’s electors are not in favour of running for office in 2020.
According to a study conducted by the Suffolk University Department of Policy Studies and Boston Globe, 58% of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of running for election.
32% were in favour of becoming a candidate.
More than one of the respondents supported the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent candidates for democracy in the 2020 elections, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have been discussed.
According to Associated Press, Biden has said that it will formally decide on its nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war trauma at Donald Trump's election
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting for the military in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence
From what my son has to go through when he returns home, I can well identify with the other families who have to face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers have to face when they return home,” he told a public meeting at Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest a ‘power horse in the living room’ and said his son, as well as other war veterans, ‘will return home a little changed, they will return hardened, they will return wondering if he and his fellow soldiers in the army and air force have done what he and his fellow soldiers have done for this country’.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett said he was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling a gun while intoxicated.
18 states and the Federal District of Columbia support action against new asylum practice
Eighteen states and the Federal District of Columbia are seeking to change a new policy that has come into force in the United States, according to which asylum will not be granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and federal districts have filed a Letter from Friends of Justice on Friday in Washington, D.C. Supporting policy-breaking asylum seekers is reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions action brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy in August.
He says that his partner "and his sons of violent gangs" abused him. The U.S. authorities refused him asylum on 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom are asylum seekers in the United States, as states where gang and domestic violence have spread to all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the 2014 decision of the Appeals Board on asylum applications, according to which undocumented migrants have been able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the Federal District of Columbia, commented in a statement on Friday that the new policy “will ignore the decades of state, federal and international law”.
Federal law requires all asylum applications to be settled on the basis of the facts and circumstances specific to the application, and this kind of obstacle violates this principle’, the letter of the Friends of the Right states.
The prosecutors also claim in the letter that asylum seekers’ access to the practice is damaging to the US economy, as newcomers are likely to become entrepreneurs and “bring the necessary additional labour force”.
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered judges on entry to suspend the granting of asylum to victims of domestic violence and violence.
Asylum is intended for persons fleeing their home country due to persecution or fear of belonging to a race, religion, nationality or a particular social class or political opinion” Sessions announced a new asylum practice in a statement of 11.6.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even serious ones, that people face on a daily basis all over the world.
Desperate survivors rescue operations continue in Palu – the number of deaths found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting more serious.
The situation is very tight,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she calms her fevered baby in an evacuation centre in the ruined town of Palu.
Ambulances bring new bodies per minute.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered goods and try to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake are full.
Some injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated for persistent, severe aftershocks.
Her eyes are filled with tears as she recounts how a ferocious earthquake shook the fifth floor of a hotel room that she shared with her wife and daughter.
We didn’t have time to save.
I got stuck between the ruins of the wall, I think,” Harris says, according to Associated Press, and says that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
I heard my wife shouting for help and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “provoking” with “propaganda announcements”
The U.S. Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after the Chinese newspaper had published a four-page advertisement in the American daily newspaper praising the mutual interests of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid annex to China Daily in the Des Moines Register newspaper, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the 6.11. congressional elections. China has denied the allegations.
Trump's allegations of Beijing's attempts to interfere in the US election mean a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China, according to US officials who have spoken to Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread declarations to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever escalating trade war, in which both sides in turn impose tariffs on their counterpart’s exports.
According to Chinese and American experts, China’s retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were targeted at states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and long-term Governor of Iowa state says Beijing has done damage to US workers, farmers and businesses.
China “is now accelerating its provocations by further publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press” wrote Branstad in a statement published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from the US’s prestigious free word and press by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
On the other hand, there are only limited differences of opinion in the Beijing street press kiosks, and the real, different views that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly on the lead of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that “one of China’s largest newspapers avoided publishing an offer” in an article he wrote, but does not specify which newspaper it is about.
Kavanaugh Fiasco Expels Female Voters From Republicans, Analysts Warn
The fact that many of the Republican top names stand behind and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh can, according to analysts, provoke a counter-reaction, especially among female voters, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding the incident have been in big rounds, and most Republicans have already announced their desire to advance in the vote.
These things cannot be undone,” says Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell Institute at the University of Syracuse, The Hill, in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona) to have a last-minute offer on the FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November,” says Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and Speaker of the National Reform Group MoveOn, according to a newspaper published on Friday in the capital.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang “November is coming” as they protested in the Senate corridors as the ruling Republicans decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey’s testimony, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be estimatable,” says Stu Rothenberg, a non-attached political analyst in an interview with the news site.
People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that is true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the precarious female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote because they do not like the president.”
Analysts predict a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans advance with the confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court's candidate, in which he made his claim about sexual harassment.
This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee for NBC News at the beginning of last week.
It’s not just a committee vote or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be put to question. It’s a question of how the Republicans have acted and how they have treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, head of the Democratic Supporting Priorities USA group, pointed out to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in whether they should believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony, with a limited majority of people bending to the latter.
According to a new opinion poll by YouGov, 41% of the respondents believe Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% say they believe absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's push forward, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, according to a Guardian report.
Ford testified in front of the Legal Committee on oath that Kavanaugh had harassed him while Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed to him his genitals at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet counter-attack for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to which data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt’s intention to “rule the world”.
It has to be done now,” he said, referring to his start-up company.
This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal data storage” (POD).
It may include contact lists, checklists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
A unique feature of personal data storage is that it is completely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide resources, processes and the required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently comprises a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some of the developers working with the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications with the tools available on Inrupt’s website, all of which will be available from this week onwards.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team will not discuss “with Facebook and Google whether to offer people a complete change where all their business models are turned on their head overnight”.
We don’t ask for their consent.”
In a paper published at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the integrity and quality of the new Grid built for Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet at the World Wide Web Consortium’s Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains his position as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute even after Inrupt was launched.
I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the heroic priest of the First World War
The city celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Church of England’s only victorious cross medal, a military priest.
The medal for bravery was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel, Pastor Bernard Vanille on 29 September 1918, following the events of the attack on the villages of Bellengli and Lehaucourt.
However, Vann died four days later and never found out about his highest British military homage.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is “affectingly symbolic”; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather’s feat.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quent “in a very dense fog and under the fire of heavy field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the front line and, "with the greatest bravery", led the advance of the troops before attacking the field cannon alone. In the ensuing battle, Vann fell down with his own hands three soldiers of the cannon battery.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4.10.1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something I could never achieve, something that arouses respect."
Michael Vann He laid a wreath with his brother, Dr James Vann, after a parade with the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it is a “great honour to be able to take part in the parade” and added, “a great number of people are remembering the honour of a true hero.”
Friends of the MMA waited awake all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – TV channel showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you’ve been watching all night to watch the expected Bellator 206, and the whole event is not presented.
The event in San Jose had 13 matches, six of which were scheduled to be broadcast live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the show changed to Pipsa Posu to be a big shock for the viewers.
Some spectators were not really happy to watch all night because of the match.
One MMA friend opened up on Twitter describing the replacement of the match with a cartoon “some kind of sick joke”.
According to the law, this content was not suitable to be presented at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to change it to a children’s program,” explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Marketing and Communications Assistant Director at Bellator.
Pipsa Pig, yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said that schedules will be worked on to allow UK viewers to follow events in the future.
I am thinking of a re-transmission that is likely to make the programme work,” Coker said.
It’s six o’clock in the morning, however, and we won’t be able to present the programme until Sunday in our time, which in turn is Monday in their time.
We are working on this.
You can believe that when the program changed their heads, the messages started to move in one direction and another, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not the case, however, but was a legislative matter.
I can promise that this will not happen next time.
We limited the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and tried too much.
This is a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
The swimmer and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he feels inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says he only noticed when he came to secondary school that “not everyone is the same as me”.
Speaking on Radio 4 on Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, Daley says he spoke about gay rights to give others ‘hope’.
He also explains how it was no longer so important to win at the Olympics after having a child.
Kristy Young, the long-term radio host, has taken several months off due to illness.
When performing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt less "than everyone else" when he was young, because "it was not socially acceptable to have boys and jobs."
To this day, these feelings, feeling less and different, have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I needed to succeed.
He says he wanted to show that he was ‘something’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
A double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he is appearing at this year's Commonwealth Games in appeal to criminalize homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion tells us that he falls in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – ‘has come as a surprise’.
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
If you experience so many things at such a young age” – he took part in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – “it’s hard to find another person of the same age who would have experienced the same kind of compassion and adversity,” Daley says.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – which has changed Daley’s “whole perspective”.
If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning the gold medal,” he says.
You know, there are more things than a golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 of brain cancer at the age of 40.
Daley said his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the most recent things he asked Daley about about the 2012 Olympics tickets, he wanted to sit in the front row.
I could not tell him that he will no longer be there to be in the front row,” Daley says.
I held him by the hand when his breath stopped. It was only after the breath had really stopped and he had died that I finally realised that he was not invulnerable,” he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I knew this was something I’ve been dreaming of all my life – jump in front of the home audience at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first selection of songs in the broadcast – the song “Proud” by Heather Small – which already evoked feelings when he was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Half-size Mickelson replacement bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson of the United States breaks the record by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round on Sunday, but he has to make a significant effort to avoid a record run in history as an unfortunate show.
Mickelson, who plays every two years at the event for the record 12th time, moved to the bench with Captain Jim Furyk for the duration of Saturday's 4ball and 4some.
In general, the focus of attention is on the five-time American Major tournament winner who now spent half of the day as a cheerleader and on the other side of the pitch trying to take control of his bet.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers in his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National course, where a long-grown rough ground punishes for inaccurate beats.
If there isn’t enough opposition in the field, in the ninth game on Sunday, we face the well-known British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who is playing together with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to have a four-win streak this week.
If Americans who are four points behind in 12 singles get a flying start, then the game of Michelson can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his players, but what can be said about the situation?
He fully understands the role he played today. He patted me on the back, hugged me and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he would play two games.
I imagined something else, but this is how it went and we came up with such a solution.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for several Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It can also mark the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, though never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says that his presence brings something unspecified to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes people at the expense of jokes, and he’s a funny type everyone likes,” he explains.
Younger players probably also had a lot of fun with him this week. It’s fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a leader can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup’s great leadership before the last day of the singles can become a bumpy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where, on the side led by Seve Ballesteros, there was a five-point lead over the Americans, but who survived with lime lines just as much as his nose and won with the narrowest possible margin of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
It reminds itself of how we led briskly at Valderrama, we led briskly at Brookline, where we lost, but won at Valderrama, albeit only a little,” Bjorn said after watching the team’s 5–3 victories in 2018, both on Friday and yesterday, moving to 10–6 on Le Golf National.
History will show both me and all the other team members that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we will shoot with a large caliber.
We go to the field and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we only aim for it.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side, but we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted by how his team players have performed in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I will never lick until I fall for such things.
Tomorrow is a completely different matter.
Tomorrow, priority will be given to individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It is great to be in the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when the field is alone, then the player’s capacity is tested to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be conveyed to the players – tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best.
Now we have to give up the partner who can go [to the field alone] and do the best we can.”
Unlike Bjorn, the opposing captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced last-day turnarounds in both directions. He was a member of the team that won at Brookline before becoming a loser when the European team won with the “Medinah miracle”.
I remember every bad word,” he answered the question of how the 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw put his team’s lines to the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When you get things moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our composition accordingly, and we will place the boys in the field as we wish, as you know, we are going to do miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead a defensive battle and meets Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in line to face their European counterparts.
I put the team's friends in this order because I think it's going through the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his choice of singles.
German new warship delayed again
The latest frigate from the German fleet should have been put into service in 2014. The vessel is intended to replace the obsolete equipment during the Cold War, but it will be put into service at the earliest next year due to the increasing number of military systems and explosive costs, according to local media.
According to a military spokesman for Die Zeit, the deployment of the first vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems have haunted the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class vessels ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen class frigates.
According to the available data, they are equipped with powerful cannons, missile systems to combat aircraft and surface vessels, and stealth technology, such as radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic signal observability technology.
Another important feature of the vessel is its longer service interval – the new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the home port.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the warships at the cutting edge of technology, which are said to have the effect of improving Germany's influence in the overseas territories, are already obsolete when they enter service," Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate ended up in headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a vessel after it has been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media has talked about the essential “software and hardware faults” that make a warship unfit for combat missions.
The lack of software is particularly important because the size of the fleet of the Baden-Württemberg class is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibilities for subsequent upgrades of the fleet.
Rhineland-Palatinate, which has a capacity of 7 000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by Germany in the Second World War.
In addition to faulty equipment, the price tag for the whole project is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have risen to EUR 3.1 billion, when the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the introduction of new frigates have arisen as the German maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Director of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, pointed out that the fleet's usable ships "are running low".
According to the authorities, the problem has increased over time because old vessels have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been delivered to replace them.
He regretted that no frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be introduced into the fleet.
Environmentalists are listening to the hidden life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats exploit the terrain when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the new study will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation measures.
A study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland has been carried out in the area of Inverewe Garden, in Western Ross, with the observation of ephemeral and dwarf bats, as well as ear-bounds and water-wings.
In the study, special storage devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
The organisation’s employees and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequencies of the sounds and the species concerned shall be ensured by the analysis of the experts.
Based on the results, a habitat map and a report are created in which the behaviour of the bats can be presented in a picture that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organisation’s conservation adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how different species use them.
The data helps in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, so that bats and related species are taken into account.
The population of bats in Scotland and the UK as a whole has declined significantly over the past 100 years.
Construction and construction work threaten the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful for catching catches than their eyes.
Bats use advanced echo tracking technology to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental organization that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of rest areas and, in some cases, rescue operations for animals.
The organisation has even established Scotland’s first and only protected area dedicated to the protection of bats in the areas of Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat species are found.
David Thompson says the area is ideal for bats.
Threave is very suitable for bats,” he says.
We have old buildings and trees and, overall, a good living environment.
We don’t know everything about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us better understand what bats need to succeed.”
He stresses the importance of inspecting buildings for bats before carrying out renovation work, as the destruction of one bat resting place can unintentionally cause the death of up to 400 female bats and chicks and destroy a whole local population.
Bats are protected animals and it is prohibited to kill, disturb or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official from the bat protection organization, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, “We still have a lot to learn from our bats, and we don’t yet know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the allegations of rape against him as “fake news” and says people want to “promote themselves” by using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping a woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375 000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on the Instagram live stream for 142 million of his followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the allegations and described them as “fake news”.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner said to the camera.
They just want to promote themselves using my name.
That is normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine,” the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit brought by Der Spiegel for allegations they have called, according to the Reuters news agency, “unworthy reporting of privacy concerns”.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, says the player is demanding compensation for “spiritual suffering in accordance with the severity of the violation, which probably means the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are reported to have met at a nightclub and moved to a player's room where he is alleged to have raped him anally, according to papers delivered to the Clark County Regional Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was “99 percent a good type”, but that “one percent” was disappointing.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photographs of his injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in a settlement because he was “horrored about the possibility of revenge” and worried about being “a victim of public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old now claims that he is seeking the annulment of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to the deal to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus with a $100 million deal.
Brexit: UK “will regret forever” end of car manufacturing
Britain would “repent forever” if it lost its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered the announcement of a temporary suspension of production in his factory near Derby in Burnaston to be “disappearing” from the EU without an agreement.
We need a deal,” Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of border delays will be reflected in job losses if Brexit is ended without an agreement.
The Burnaston factory – where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models were manufactured – produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be interrupted,” says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Burnaston unit at Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini-manufacturing plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern, according to the car manufacturers, concerns the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and cars are produced on demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Keeping a warehouse of more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire plant is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be discontinued.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement, which not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we need to take advantage of,” he says in BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers’ statements show that we absolutely need to be able to continue the series of well-functioning supply chains that have worked so far.”
Toyota does not know how long production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years as a trade union trustee at the factory, says a growing concern among members: “In my experience, lost jobs never return.
The government spokesperson said: “We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein may be "must be postponed for another week" due to the tumult surrounding Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia's interference in the elections, Trump's associates with Russia, and possible actions taken by the President to prevent justice.
Washington has been rumoured for months that Trump was going to dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardize Mueller's impartiality.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of the President's resignation on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the information in the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and it has been reported that the purpose of the meeting was Rosenstein's resignation.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so the day of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would “not rather” dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because it coincided with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump Press Manager Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News' Sunday show.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "There is no date for this. It could be next week, this week, it could be postponed for another week due to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
It remains to be seen, but I always want to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The news anchor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to reasons other than “attention-seeking” by TV reporters, but said, “I do not dispute the fact that they are attention-seeking.”
However, Sanders suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
The president holds more question hours than any president before him,” he says, adding, without quoting any evidence, “we have checked those numbers.”
Press conferences will still be held," Sanders said, "but it is infinitely better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen us do this many times in the last few weeks, and this will be replaced by press releases so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Presenting yourself at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the President may have shown the reason for this when appearing uninhibited and from time to time strangely assembled journalists.
Minister of Health wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from EU countries regarding fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to employees of the Scottish healthcare system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after Brexit.
A Scottish Member of Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter after less than six months of the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applications for ‘established status’ for EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: During the summer, the separation negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal break.
I know that for all of you these are uncertain times.
That is why I want to reiterate how much we value the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of nationality.
Co-workers from all over the EU and beyond will bring valuable experience and skills that will strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
Supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team had lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, reports the Tennessee journalist Mike Organ.
Head coach of the Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before the middle of the day.
He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it,” Reed says.
The trainers and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen at the sideline before placing him on stretchers and taking him to the side for a more detailed assessment.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told WSMV channel reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has been out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is no information on the type/extension of injury at this stage” and that the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays for the first time on the team from Illinois after his transfer.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and extra money will be used to help the homeless according to the Conservative Party's new plans.
The aim of the change is to neutralize Corby’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will inform foreign buyers today about the higher stamp duty rate they will be paying when buying real estate in the UK.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby’s efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises about cheaper housing and paid attention to the taxation of high-income people.
To raise stamp duty on people and businesses that do not pay taxes to the UK, extra money is directed to government action to alleviate the plight of the homeless.
The surcharge – which is added to the current stamp tax two years ago in addition to the increases in second and investment housing – can be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to yield as much as £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of London’s new buildings are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which increases prices and hampers first-time buyers’ opportunities in the owner-occupied housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the UK, especially in its capital, have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to facilitate the purchase of first homes for young people.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon the quotas for cheap housing to remedy the “disgraceful situation of housing” in the UK.
Corbyn has published an eye-catching series of proposals to reform the housing market, including rent restrictions and the end of “contributive evictions”.
He would also like to give the councils more power in matters related to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says: “I said last year that I was going to dedicate my Prime Minister’s term to the restoration of the British dream – that every generation should have a better life than its predecessor.
This means repairing our residential market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, can buy housing as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become a far too distant dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team”
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his “ultimate goal” is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about his challenge to bring the Northeast corner of the country back on his feet, and is currently in third place in the UK's second division.
Ross moved to the “station of lights” this summer after he had directed St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
As a player, I wanted to play in my country's team.
I made it to the second team and that was it,” Ross says on the BBC: Scotland’s Sportssound broadcast.
As a child, I often watched Scottish games at Hampden with my father, and that is something that has always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only come about if I succeed as a manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic leader says he was not worried about stepping into the shoes of his prominent predecessors in a prominent club, and he has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
At the moment, my own success will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
On the basis of the structure and ability of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he says.
It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I managed to take the team back to the Premier League.”
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years: first as an assistant director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coaching group.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third series of games and raised St Mirren from being a champion in the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his career as a player in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
I was probably at a crossroads with my career,” he recalls the time he took over the leadership of Alloa.
I genuinely believed I was better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a decent amount of money, and enjoyed some of the relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, like stress and work-related pressure, but team management seems just the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead a team, and now I’m working on it. I feel better in my body than ever in my adult life.”
The full interview is available on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time to enjoy a pint is Saturday at 17.30, study shows
The summer heat wave has given a boost to pubs struggling with British difficulties, but at the same time put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains grew by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, said: “Continuous sunny weather and England’s longer-than-predicted participation in the World Cup meant that July turned out to be 2.8% higher for pubs like June, while the month was even worse for restaurants.
The 1.8% drop in sales of restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales increased more than the decline in restaurant sales.
The pubs that focus on the food side also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than the restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to get out of their mind.
The sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, and the sales of food were down by three per cent.”
Paul Newman of RSM, a company providing leisure and hotel restaurant consulting services, says: “The results continue the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the home-based catering market.
It is no surprise that the struggle for restaurant chains continues, although the decline in annual sales of 4.8% is particularly sharp now that the industry is struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come to worse seams for food-focused operators, and only time will tell if the milder temperatures of August bring the industry the much needed pause.
The total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer following the sale of the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry, which collects and analyses results from a group of 47 industries with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion.
One-fifth of children conceal social media accounts from their parents
One-fifth of children – some up to 11 years of age – conceal social media accounts from their parents and teachers, according to the study.
A study of 20 000 secondary school students revealed an increasing phenomenon of ‘instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns that sexual content may be shared on accounts
20% of students say they have a ‘main account’ that is shown to parents
One-fifth of children – some of whom are up to 11 years of age – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20 000 secondary school students revealed a rapidly growing presence of ‘instagram fake accounts’, which refers to the Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has raised fears that sexual content may be published in the accounts.
20% of students said they like a cleaned ‘main account’ for parents to show while using other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager who hoped to be raped after colliding with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site.
A study commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Rector's Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 had two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan says: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to the Scottish Sports Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Board of Athletes and takes part in the annual General Assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete, and the chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, describes this as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the sport’s extensive, international experience over the last decade.
Eilidh is highly respected by athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to the board,” Beattie says.
Doyle says: “I look forward to my role as the mouthpiece of athletes and I hope I can be helpful and help guide Scottish sport in the right direction.”
The four Olympic gold medals won by an American athlete who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now serves as the BBC's permanent commentator, lost his ability to walk as a result of a transient brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.”
I could not walk.
According to doctors, only time will tell if and in what condition I recover.
This has been an exhausting job, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am already training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
A cow-like advertisement for mothers to share their opinions online
Breast-feeding mothers of breast-feeding companies have shared their opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a manufacturer of consumer technology, has launched a product called “the world’s first silent and wearable breast pump”. Its marketing is accelerated with a language-cheeked and music-styled advertisement that describes the new pump’s release for breastfeeding mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled barn, among other things, in the following song: “Yes, I milk myself, but I don’t see a tail” and “if you don’t notice, they are not udders, but they are boobs”.
The chorus continues: “Pull it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page caused a discussion online.
A video with 77 000 views and hundreds of comments has sparked a conflicting reaction among viewers, many say it is ruining the dairy industry’s daily ‘horrors’.
Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them soon after birth,” one commentator writes.

Another viewer commented: “I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why can't they be used to promote breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
The third commenter added: “A perfect reality-driven ad.”
I also received an ad from a defender: a woman admitted that the ad was “fun”.
I think this is a great idea.
I would get this if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is an ingenious product,” reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: “This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and ‘feel like cows’.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the advertisement, the women of the video reveal that they have danced with unobtrusive pumps wrapped in their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and fits discreetly inside the breastfeeding vest, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of Mother advertising agency, commented: “The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By equating nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with using the breast pump to the spotlight, and we brought out the feeling of incredible freedom of the new pump in an entertaining and reassuring way.”
The Elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk in the costume of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in silence
The number of moored migrant children has increased sharply, despite the relatively low monthly number of border crossings, partly due to the difficulties in placing children in foster families as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration.
Most foster families have traditionally consisted of paperless immigrants, and registering as a foster family can endanger their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy would have to give their fingerprints, and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level entry and customs authority, proved last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of detainees did not have a previous criminal record.
Almost 80% of people who are either foster family members or members of their households are illegal in the country, and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to look for these people,” Albence says.
In an effort to deal with children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which, in some cases, the matter must be dealt with by the court within one month of being apprehended instead of the 60-day time limit previously in place, employees of the reception centre say.
Many people prefer to appear through a video conference rather than face-to-face when advocating at a court for immigrants.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be expelled as a matter of urgency.
According to reports published in recent months by the staff of reception centres and the system, the time spent in captivity by children affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent eruptions or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, the concern is particularly pronounced in larger institutions, such as Tornello, where signs of a child’s desperation can be overlooked due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to leave immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were in the country illegally using an excuse for fighting terrorism, and that “they will be acted upon accordingly.”
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed “the war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and since then, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “sacredly fight until all Syria is cleansed” of both terrorist organisations and “illegal foreign forces”.
The United States has about 2 000 soldiers stationed in Syria, where they are mainly trained and guided by Arab forces opposing the Kurds and President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested in a unit of more than 1 000 soldiers to tear the battles to the ground.
On the refugee question, Moualem said the circumstances were good for the return and blamed the “some westerns” for “spreading irrational fears” that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
We have invited the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They politicize something that should be purely religious.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted reconstruction assistance until the end of the war, under a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last base of rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to drive political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on an area with a population of three million.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has “clear time limits” and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-related al-Nusra front fighters “who will be destroyed”.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee to establish a post-war Syrian constitution and to pave the way for the elections.
Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to “revising the provisions of the current constitution” and warned against interfering.
Why Trump is elected for the second season
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the takeover and scandal of his presidency ends prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential decision ever!”
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1,6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time of the year, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show has reached the peak of 3.5 million viewers on the most important news nights.
This is a blaze that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, chief executive producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor programme, about the minister who will rise after the attack on the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine what happens with the Roe vs. Wade affair, whether members of immigrant families can come to each other, and how the global economy can.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the responsibilities of a conscious citizen to look at the sixth hour expert panel that debates Bob Woodward’s use of source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort’s $15 000 ostrich leather pilot coat (according to Washington Post’s “arrogance for a stuffy piece of clothing”), and Stormy Daniels’ President Trump’s unpretentious descriptions of the anatomy.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario like I did before.
What he does feels like a reality show, partly because he gives something to the public every night,” says Wheelhouse Entertainment’s director and creator of the Pawnshop series Brent Montgomery Trump’s show on changing personalities and daily changing plot twists (NFL dispute, praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can’t miss a single episode, or you’ll fall off the cart.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, there was a wonderful sunny day on the northern coast of Kauai, but he could not go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not resign from the programme in which Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss said.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Money flows from the outside into a tight mid-term campaign
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania has faced a real cash flow, as the reorganisation of the constituencies requires two already elected candidates to fight in one place.
This newly redefined Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, who gained a seat in the second district last spring's special elections.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The division was resumed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituency division favoured Republicans against the Constitution.
The competition in the new 17th District has sparked an economic struggle in the main financial departments of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became widely known in Pennsylvania after the special elections in the 18th Pennsylvania constituency in March.
The place had been in the Republican Party for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won in the region by 20%.
Political commentators have taken a good lead for the democrats.
The US plans to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but backs down its intentions
The diplomats have noted that the DPRK and Panama have already listed the situation in Beijing and the mild response from Washington.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organization.
U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to call American diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the basis of “a recent policy that Taiwan is no longer recognised,” said Secretary of State Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American state with a high unemployment and life crime rate.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity. A similar meeting in the previous year was seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administrators made it clear that the meeting was to proceed and that this effectively ended speculation about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to send a signal to a scheduled meeting in mid-October about the weight the administration will give to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any further unpleasant messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesperson refused to comment on the details of the conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the protection of the anonymity clause.
History teaches
The next inevitable step might be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the right of President Trump, which is now very heavy evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to direct an investigation into whether the Trump campaign was secretly cooperating with Russia when Russia intervened in the US election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go back to his electorate, and may be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of ifs here, and I don't mean to say that the defeat of President Trump is inevitable - no more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We need to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions will determine how long this struggle will be formed.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, where the inevitable advance of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What will we do if President Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for the investigation of the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been embellished since the announcement that he had proposed to record the President's speech in secret and considered the President's possible inability to perform his duties.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' report is incorrect.
How do we react if the newly demanded FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's actions is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible claims of sexual harassment and dishonest witness testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these battles, our democracy will end up in a long and dark winter.
But I believe we will succeed because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovak Jewish and she was expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to America as an immigrant and sent me 60 years later to light the candles on that swastika table.
How can this heritage be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistically meets Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at their home on Thursday, knowing that after a draw against Villaréal in Spain earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to enter the European G-block.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from reaching the pitch this season before Villareal's 2-2 game, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good resistance,” says the 31-year-old player.
We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
Perhaps we could have won at the end of the win, but overall the draw is probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half and we got up and running in the second and we were better.
Thursday is another important evening in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game because their result was good in the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this team we can give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The composition is good and the boys enjoy; the training runs well.
I hope we can now press fully, leave the season behind us and succeed.”
Fear of pension savings takes women’s night sleep
Although the participants had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones about it.
About half of the participants in the nationwide survey said they would discuss the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they spoke to their children.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the initiative,” says Holly Snyder, deputy director of the national life insurance company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them about your wishes in time.
Talk to a professional and family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important cost-determining factor.
Take financial advice with you: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-expense insurance if you can afford it.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative so you can appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that your professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also the creation of a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to set up a trusted person to take care of financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parent would be in a health emergency on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about her medication and allergies?
Write such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
It’s not just about the financial side. Who is his doctor?” asks Martin.
What medicines are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready.”
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home late in the evening.
Around 40 years old, the victim was Ilfracombe in the Oxford Grove area of Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The police describe the attack at around 02:30 as “random works”.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim’s injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed to eyewitnesses.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the town of Palu in Indonesia on Friday.
As the communications to the area are broken, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the north of Palu in the Donggala area, which is closer to the surface centre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16 000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Key facts about Palau and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami hit the city in the middle of its 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometres (180 miles) to Sulawesi Island on the north-west coast line.
The municipality of Donggala is a provincial administrative district with an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, several tsunamis have struck the country in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the active Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake in northern Sumatra on the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia caused a tsunami on December 26 that struck 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude quake struck south of the most populated island of Indonesia, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the island's southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 magnitude quake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1 100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake struck one of the Sumatra islands of Mentawai, causing a ten-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck Aceh in the Pidie Jaya region, causing destruction and panic as people remember the enormous damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than a hundred people died in the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and presidential candidate, has been charged with assault.
According to a Saturday report by the Alaska Police, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and for preventing and resisting domestic violence at the time of arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took a phone from his female companion when he tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is in pre-trial custody in Mat-Su Pretrial, and a security deposit of $500 is imposed, KTUU reports.
According to the report, Palin came to court on Saturday and replied that he was “guaranteedly innocent”.
Palin is accused of three Class A violations, which means that he can receive a maximum of one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250 000.
He is also accused of a Class B violation for which a day of imprisonment and a $2 000 fine can be sentenced.
Palin has not been charged with a crime for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and reported an assault.
The case is currently under discussion at the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused him of beating his face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for combining her son’s violent behaviour with a traumatic stress disorder caused by a service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The magnitude of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications connections are broken and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
On social media, you can watch videos from the moment of the earthquake.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death penalty on a suspect in a NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the eight terrorist attacks that claimed the life of New York City.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in October to hit the West Side Highway in the south of Manhattan, where he drove over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the announcement of the application for the death penalty in the Southern District of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov killed “intentionally” eight of his victims and caused “intentionally” serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to impose death sentences on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court charged Saipov with 22 counts of murders to assist a terrorist organization. The federal prosecutors typically use this crime title in cases of organised crime. In addition, the charges included violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and preparation,” the prosecutors stated and described the way Saipov carried out his actions as “horrible, cruel and shameful.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harms and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the report states.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
A decade has passed since the death of the Southern District of New York.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murders of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in the New York federal case in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as doomed to the Soviet Union for espionage during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told the researchers that his actions felt good, the police said.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov also wanted an ISIL ticket in his hospital room.
He responded to the 22-point accusation that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defence lawyers, said the defence was "naturally disappointing" for the prosecutor's decision.
In our opinion, the decision to impose the death penalty and not the recognition and life sentence without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to the parties involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defence had previously requested that he not be required to pay the death penalty.
The Conservative MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged today in a protest against the Conservatives to “mobilize the civil army.”
Former Ukip leader said politicians need to feel pressured by Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested him to lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Bone said to the marchers in Birmingham that Britain would “be out already” if Farage were a Brexit secretary.
But May faces a deep division between her ranks as she reconciles a challenge that is underlined by conservatives in favour of remaining, who joined a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the surface under pressure from supporters and opponents of Brexit, as well as from the EU.
The supporters urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback - and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull he wanted to “screw the Chequers proposal to go”.
He suggested that Farage should be involved and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would already be outside,” he said.
Wellingborough's parliamentarian added: "I will defend Brexit, but the Chequers proposal needs to be eliminated."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: “We did not fight world wars to become subordinates.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.”
Bone stunned the idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: “The fact that the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely false claim.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and said to reporters: “I will just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by party members or activists who really go out on the streets and are generally responsible for our success.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs while they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians need to feel the pressure if they intend to roll over to the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class,” he said.
They’re trying to water down Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to accept it.”
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are going to run a Brexit to feel pressure from you.”
We are going to mobilize the army of citizens of this country, which gave us a victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is again an independent, self-governing and proud state.
Meanwhile, supporters marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved “Tories Against Brexit” signs. The group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party ridiculed the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party app at the beginning of the meeting.
These are the people who say they will get the IT systems in order and all the technology for the Canada plus plus arrangement and the smooth border operations for free trade in Ireland,” he added.
It is a farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering a presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering a presidential nomination after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts-based democrat was talking about his future in the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl in November, who was co-chair of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign for Trump.
Warren may have been expected to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th town hall meeting with voters since the beginning of the Trump season.
One participant asked whether Warren was going to seek a president.
Warren replied that now is the time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest place.
Arrest in LSU's Sims shooting case
The Louisiana Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that they had arrested a person suspected of the Friday shooting that resulted in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at the ET briefing.
The police had released a video of the Friday shooting incident and asked for help to identify the man in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus early Friday.
Wayde Sims got his head shot and died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted in the hearings that he had been present, held a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist when arrested and was taken to East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, playing 32 games and 10 starts last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Cup with his victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes' team arrangements played an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the stake and left Hamilton almost on his own to defend his seat in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the depot first and left Hamilton to drive a number of tails, which should have resolved the situation.
Mercedes went to the depot later and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton passed after a little contact and then the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the line to defend his position after two thirds of his move.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition as he continued to change tyres with the aim of quickly ending and taking fourth place in Kimi Räikkönen.
He eventually came to the depot in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed with the remaining eight rounds while Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has made an exceptional effort to win a double,” Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that she did not leak a public letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was evidence of the "nasty, malice and dishonesty of people".
That one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, mean, vicious and dishonest,” the President said.
When we see publications and leaked things and then they say ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you have this information?
Do you remember his answer...years of document — oh, what?
Oh no.
I didn't leak."
Have a look now.
Did we...No, we didn’t leak,” he added, scorning the Senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford’s allegations of Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s allegations and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein said to the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wishes.
But his ban was not acceptable to the president who commented on it on Saturday: “I tell you that was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused by three women of sexual harassment and thought that the Democrats would use the accusations for their own benefit.
They have decided to regain power by any means.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and control,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars claimed compensation for the loss of the Friday's Elite League match against Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early stage lead thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to levels before Dwyer reinstated the Giants.
Francois Bouchard evened out to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who won a 2-1 underdog in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time during the season after the Giants had won three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute of 3:35 of Kendall McFaull's pass. David Rutherford fed when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a hot opening episode, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered Cownie's handicap goal at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead of the Giants for the first set-off by hitting the second goal of the evening at the end of the first set.
The home team gathered their ranks and Bouchard once again leveled the goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen was able to score the first lead goal for Dundee at the end of the second round. He also secured the victory with his team's fifth goal midway through the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games at their next home on Milton Keynes Friday.
The pilot died to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board were able to escape the earthquake.
In Indonesia, the air traffic controller has become a hero after his death, ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely entered the air.
More than 800 people have died and several are missing after a severe earthquake and the tsunami caused by it hit Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are testing the area, and several people have been trapped in the fallen material in the town of Palu.
Even though the co-workers fled their lives in a shop, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation in the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufr Airport in Palu.
He remained in position to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was safely released into the air.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower, which he thought was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirait said that Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
A helicopter from Kalimantan Balikpapan was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter was able to return.
This news breaks our hearts,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims will increase to thousands, as the disaster authorities in the country have announced that the connections with the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong are incomplete.
The number of victims is believed to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo, the agency’s spokesperson.
Even six-metre waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and cargo planes bring assistance and equipment to the area.
Family mother Risa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: #Ambulances bring corpses all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
In an interview with CNN, Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross hastens to help the survivors, but we do not know what awaits us.
This is already a tragedy, but it may prove even worse.”
President of Indonesia, either Widodo, arrived on Sunday and said in a speech to the country’s armed forces: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, Indonesia.
Air Niugin says one person is missing after a plane crashes into the lagoon
Representatives of the airline that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now say that one person was missing, although earlier reports indicate that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from a safely sinking aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional passenger information, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was in a stable state.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy have both reported landing in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to wade in a sinking machine in the depths of water for emergency exits.
He said that the passengers had panicked and shouted, and that he himself had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working on repairs at a nearby dock were involved in rescue work by transporting people to the shore by a rubber boat before the plane sank about 30 meters (hundred feet) deep into the water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have been killed in the last two decades by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but Air Niugini has not been involved in the accidents.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a re-examination of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified hours as an expert witness in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on his mobile phone to bring together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the victim's death night.
Rowlett reported that he had received location data for several mobile phones, indicating that Tellis was against his previous claims with Chambers on the night he died, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers while Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford proved on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "s lies because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Based on the data stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The closing remarks of the defence are planned to be launched on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to Bristol-based band The High Breed, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages related to political and social problems.
They want to return to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark-skinned one?!
New York woman sues couple for racist SMS
A New Yorker woman sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from a child's mother complaining that she is "one more black".
The couple denies that they are racist and shares the challenge of “blackmail.”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed regret when Giselle Maurice, a new nurse, arrived at work on her first working day in 2016 and it turned out to her that she was dark-skinned.
Eiiiiii, again dark-skinned,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his men in a text message.
He then sent a message to Giselle Maurice, twice, instead of her husband.
After realizing the mistake, Plasco-Flaxman had dismissed Maurice, according to the New York Post, stating that his previous African-American passports had failed and had been waiting for the Filipino this time.
Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent home by taxi.
Maurice now sues the couple for compensation for the separation and wants to pay $350 a day for the six-month period he was originally hired to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
I want to show them that you can’t do that,” he said to the Post on Friday, adding, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the racist allegations, saying that Maurice's termination of employment was a justifiable solution because they could not trust him after insulting him.
My wife sent him something she was not supposed to say.
He is not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco said in an interview with Posti.
But would you leave your child in the care of someone you have been unkind to, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Truly?"
Plasco equated the challenge with blackmail and said that his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
Do you start chasing someone else in such a situation?
It’s not very comfortable,” the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, prepping their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddy's publishers feared that the public would not identify with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, says of the letter: "It is difficult to relate to the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It’s amusing now that the huge popularity of Paddington is known.”
Noting that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of a toy bear, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication felt bitterly sweet, as his father died the previous year.
He described Paddington as a very important family member and said his father was silently proud of its success.
He was quite a quiet man, and not of a perverse type," says the daughter.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child’s achievement to him; one that you are proud of, even though it is not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddy's success that way.
Although it was his creation, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dead daughter on the phone
His daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Nad called every now and then and said it was really bad that he was not expected to survive,” Ednan-Laperouse says.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter will die in a couple of minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, “I love you so much, honey.
I will be with you soon.
I am with you.”
The drugs that helped doctors keep his heart running gradually disappeared from his body.
He had died a little earlier and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was running out.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to hold myself together.”
In the end, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane among the other passengers - who knew nothing about the test she was going through.
No one knew,” he said.
I kept my head down and tears were flowing all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt tremendous compassion for Nadi.
That he now needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved my daughter.”
Grieving women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out cards with encouraging messages and a phone number that can be used to get support.
Davis's son, Tyler, was depressed at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don’t want any parents to experience the feelings I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said his son was a promising cook with a catchy grin.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile illuminates the whole room.”
However, he stopped working before his death because he felt “in the dark”.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old little brother found his brother, who had taken his life by himself.
Davis says he is constantly afraid of the after-effects.
Davis created the cards “to tell people that there are people to talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't stay silent - you have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for many years and lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother had died.
He didn’t say he was down or depressed or anything like that,” Humphreys said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He was in the country on Christmas Day. When the children opened their presents, he did not look at them or anything like that.”
He says that Mark's death was a difficult trauma for them, but they still have to make it clear: "It breaks up the family.
It will tear us apart.
But all we have to do is continue to live and fight forward.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation
I thought if we could really achieve what he hoped for - a time-limited investigation - perhaps we could achieve a little unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "decompose" into a deadlock caused by supporters.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an investigation by the FBI?
Reluctance is about timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if the Republicans’ success is poor as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country’s Supreme Court will become more difficult.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush's time and met with his wife, Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is prepared?
The Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow across the game and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors falls during Kimi
According to the South Korean legislature, the number of people who defected to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's seven-year reign.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Harmonization and reported that there were 1 127 defections last year - in 2011 there were 2 706.
According to Park, the decisive factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in the prices of human smugglers.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
Most of the North Korean defectors will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
More than 30 000 North Koreans have entered the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often returns them by force.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea have continued to improve significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on the stalled negotiations on the dismantling of nuclear equipment.
This followed the historic meeting of June, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed on a general approach towards nuclear non-proliferation in the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of seizing sanctions after the meeting.
Without any confidence on the part of the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and under no circumstances will we be the first to unilaterally dismantle our equipment,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was temporarily unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on it in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I could not help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, she would be called “hysterical,” Pelosi said of his own reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied allegations that she sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in control of his emotions and sometimes he almost shouted and lost his speech when he told about his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democratic members of the committee without calling himself a “grotesque and planned persecution of a person” organised by the angry liberals of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential defeat.
He said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unable to act in the Supreme Court because it showed him to be biased towards the Democrats.
I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” Pelosi said.
He was afraid when asked if he would prosecute Kavanaugh if his election was confirmed and if the Democrats could get a majority in the House.
Let's say this - if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not competent not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he currently works," Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working at the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal.
He added that as a democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible provisions on health care reform or the Roe v Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative jurisprudence.
During the hearings related to his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It’s not a good time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected to the court and we would be expected to say it’s great,” Pelosi said.
Women have to cope with everything
It's a legitimate fire-speech when months and years of rage overwhelm him, and he can't keep it without crying.
We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don’t think it’s unusual at all, do you?
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she too was crying when angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her speech partner in a situation where she got angry and began to cry: “You may think I’m sad now because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was ingenious.”
Tears are justified as a route of rage, although they are generally misunderstood in fundamental terms.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when I once wept speechlessly out of anger and an older woman - a cold-tipped boss I had always been a little afraid of - caught me from the neck and pulled me into the staircase.
Never let them see you cry,” he said.
They don’t know you’re furious.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they got upset."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship with a boat called Monkey Business in 1987 and got out of the race, Schroeder felt very frustrated that there was no reason why he would not seek the president himself.
It was not a very well thought-out decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates and the least needed was one more.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.’”
Since the campaign time was already long, he was behind fundraising and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he could raise two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
It turned out to him that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
Do they think I'm going to get a discount?" he thought.
When he made his speech and announced that he would not launch an official campaign, he fell into the power of his feelings -- for his supporters of gratitude, for a system of frustration that made it so difficult to raise funds for election work for voters and not for delegates, and for the sexism of hatred -- that he was unable to speak.
I could have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the reactions of the press.
You might have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my gravestone will probably be hacked into a memento
He was crying.
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war was an ear-catching one, and although the struggle is far from over, the break-up of the two countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing import taxes on China's main export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting imports of $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all imports from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded every once in a while, most recently by imposing customs duties of five to ten percent on US imports worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-to-eye way, and it does not seem that the world's second-largest economic power is easing for a moment.
In order to get Washington back, we should give in to our own demands, but the public to the United States would be all too humiliating for President Xi Jinping of China.
Experts note, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing its interdependence between countries.
A quick political decision, whether in Washington or Beijing, can create the conditions that will trigger an economic downturn in one of the countries, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than the bystanders have so far understood,” says Abigail Grace, a research assistant with expertise in Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syrian Foreign Minister says the country is “ready” for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country would improve.
The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore the normal situation in areas destroyed by terrorists.
The circumstances now make it possible for refugees to return voluntarily to the country from which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for the help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, winning 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside of Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown to itself when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson had a hard time during almost the entire tournament and hit his starting shot in the water with a 16-hole par-3-track giving a match to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of the four players to score 5-0 since the tournament was launched in its present form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America was forced out with a result of 5&4 against the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, ranked as the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European ever with a total of 25.5 career points.
I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
The year has been heavy.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said the moved Garcia after the European team's victory.
He transfers the torch to his fellow countryman Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods in Sunday 2&1 races.
I feel tremendous pride after winning Tiger Woods. I grew up admiring him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Weird statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and remains second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finauta, whose game was of high quality throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a failed performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We put pressure on the European team in this morning's games.
We put up with it.
Honor to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We are regrouping, working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we are moving forward.
These 12 guys are great and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to lift the hat.
We met our winners.”
Red tide bloom situation: concentrations fall in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota areas
According to the latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decline in algae levels in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more fragmented algal areas are reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Tide bloom stretches along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to the southern districts of Lee.
Ferries can be spotted ten miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer ferries than last week.
Red tide blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the Pinellas County coast in the past week, concentrations ranged from low to high on the Hillsborough County coasts, from background levels to high concentrations in Manate and Sarasota County, from background levels to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, and from background levels to high concentrations in Lee County Coasts, and in Collier County, concentrations were low.
Respiratory symptoms continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
In the last week, there were no reports of respiratory symptoms in the northwest of Florida.
