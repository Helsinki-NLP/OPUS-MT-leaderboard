One day you will know the truth.
You will never make him agree.
You can't do it without me.
You will not be late.
You don't believe what I found.
You will not find a better job in a hurry.
You would be safe there.
You don't believe me.
You probably don't have a knife with you?
Oh, hi!
The Zucchini are green.
