A 9-year-old boy was found in Tampere
The police have had a search task due to a 9-year-old boy’s escape from Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A report of the disappearance of a boy who had left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the Police Situation Centre, the boy has been contacted and is not at risk of life and health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanomat at midnight that he had been found.
He's fine and now we're going to start the after-explanation.
The boy was found near the home, my father told me.
Ronaldo again fiercely - tearing the paint difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued to work in the Champions League as well.
The fight between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League's goal kingdom turned at least for a moment to the benefit of the latter.
Real Madrid Ronaldo went to the top of all-time goal scorer statistics when he shot two hits in the Shahtar Donetsk network for penalty shootouts and one in the game.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80, while Barcelona Messi, who was even-reading with him before Tuesday, had 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian football league Serie A in the early part of the season, but in the Champions League's D-block it started with a 2-1 guest victory over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored just over ten minutes before the end of Juventus’s Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was blunted by the absence of knee-stricken Sergei Aguero.
In this weekend's Premier League game, Aguero came to the pitch only in the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, was also hit hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old defender Luke Shaw's away match lasted only a quarter of an hour.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking glide hit the ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium a dozen minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
In the 41st minute, Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno smoothed before the break with extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
The A-block Paris Saint-Germain started in the Champions League of the season.
The case involved Angel Di Maria, an Argentinian who changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right hand and raised the ball to the back corner past Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
In the second half, Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 for PSG.
PSG has been among the winners of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league’s small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the PSG star, first faced Malmö FF, his professional career starting team.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow TsSKA lost the B-block in a match in Germany for Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition Party demanded immediate resignation - President made the wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech he gave in the country's parliament again at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was in full force of spirit.
The main opposition party, MDC, demanded that Mugabe resign because he was too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only occurred in the staff of Mugabe and that the President had done nothing wrong.
In the past and now the influence of China on the country's economy was discussed by Mugabe.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Next week, Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders due to the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the heads of state should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are at the table of the Interior Ministers.
Teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend during an emergency call
During the emergency call, Shannon Lamb, a university teacher with only a little colour, tells the police that she shot her girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his “golden dog” is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the deceased woman’s immediate relatives can be found on his phone.
Inside the house, police found a handwritten message written on the side of Amy Prentiss’ body and book: “I am so sorry I could cancel this I loved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me,” said a letter signed by Lamb, according to experts.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 km to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed the teacher of history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Delta State University Chief of Police Lynn Buford said the university officials heard about the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
He said Lamb had made a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police besieged the voice.
The authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motive a day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher who, however, may have had problems.
The students told me that they were waiting for his classes.
The police of Gautier, the prentiss, said that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the “great people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, “as if something had been wrong”.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told me that he had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s remuneration principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
Rector of the University William LaForge said there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, but that there was clearly something in Lamb's mind.
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had escaped from the campus, the police were able to trace him when he moved back from the state of Arkansas in Mississippi.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile and a half south of his parents' house in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi," said Metel Johnson, a Washington County cause of death investigator.
Lamb's car was still running on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed a doctorate in educational science in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old when they met through shared friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a fun, older friend who for many years tried to teach Hairston to play the guitar.
He was quite a charmer at that time.
All the girls were molten wax when she was there, said Hairston, now 40, who lives in the suburb of Jackson in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he had killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the river bank in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O’Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
He's really shocked," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was her mother's best friend.
O’Steen said he hadn’t met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter, Abigail, that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail both appeared on the summer market three years ago.
Later they played together in some gigs.
O’Steen said that her daughter is making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
The bartender of The Julep Room, a dusk bar near Gautier, and the occasional entertainer Mike Shaffer, tells us that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his performance of guitar and harmonica for a sparse audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
Just a happy couple,” he said.
We fooled and threw together.
So they were both quite clever.
The deceased teacher Schmidt led the first year of the students' seminar program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, said the school's English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland, Delta State campus was held a candle-worship attended by approximately 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the fair, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
We are trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported on Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster from Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The story has been corrected by the police saying that Lamb has now made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it does not employ as many workers for the holiday season as it did last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that current permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, compared with 45 000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the interviews with the applicants will start this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
While there are months to go, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores, as well as the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film Back to the Future was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also worth noting for personal reasons.
We sat in the theatre waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to me,” she said in the upcoming documentary film Back in Time trailer.
The film begins and I think it happens that I'm just a bit of an act of yawning and a stretch of a hand from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future, where Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd were interviewed, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: “For me, it is without a doubt the greatest time travel film ever.”
Back in Time is available as an on-demand video, DVD and some cinemas in October.
UN Director says Syria's situation will not be resolved peacefully
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "will not be resolved militarily", and the additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director again urged all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced that he would meet with the five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - in connection with the General Assembly's ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces “has made the situation impossible to resolve.”
Ban called on the five permanent member states to demonstrate solidarity and consensus on the Syrian crisis as demonstrated by the agreement on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 support survey results that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him as a windscreen.
Others just think of him as a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the support polls, it has not been (yet) successful.
Out of the last 11 national surveys, ten Donald Trump has been in charge of a two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously reflect on what this means in terms of the title of the real estate king.
Of course, the parliamentary term is only in the early stages.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators note that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership to rising Herman Cain, neither of whom was able to secure any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noted Trump's perseverance and began to use his funds to overthrow him.
The following recent support survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a transitory step:
Trump's recommendations have been reversed.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, support surveys from Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the property king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At the moment, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a support survey conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60% of Republicans said they welcomed Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be “shocked” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% “enthusiastic” vs. Trump 40%).
The next most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters would be “unsatisfied” or “shocked” if Jeb Bush, a favourite of those in power, became a candidate.
The fiery nature of Trump is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to a Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 per cent of the voters who turn to the Republican side at the national level think that the real estate king has the right character for the president.
According to a survey conducted by Quinnipiac last week, the figure for the first party meeting in Iowa is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to a survey by ABC/Posti, 44 per cent think that his character is not suitable for serving as president, and nearly six out of ten think that his character does not belong to the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten thought Trump was the most likely option when asked who was most likely to be nominated for the Republican nomination.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information release: Republican voters have not always had access to the brightest crystal ball possible.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry was nominated, and only 28% were in favour of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters find the Trump campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as support against Trump has been divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Christie with 33 points each.
He's on a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump winning candidate?
If they were put against each other, Ben Carson would win a businessman Trump with a big 18 point difference.
The majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NOT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of the voters who support Trump have decided who their vote will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can be absolutely sure that they will never change their mind.
46% said they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on the Trump side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants “rape” in his campaign opening speech, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s mightiness drives Latin voters beyond the Republican Party and damages rebranding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
The frustration of the government has reached a new height.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their role outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in an ABC/Post poll on Monday that they would rather choose a non-political person than one with government experience.
They are also angry at the federal government.
A two-week survey from Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are “unsatisfied” and 21% are “really angry”.
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance in Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Labour Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn meets David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn raises questions about his first six questions shortly after noon, and is likely to be watched closely by both the media and the Labour MPs.
Corbyn has called for “less theatre and more facts” in this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the events to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first political test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual trade union convention meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour leader to stand silently during the national anthem in Tuesday's memorial service, which took place on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, has provoked criticism among Conservative MPs and has appeared in a number of front-page articles.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said he "has been respectfully silent" and that he acknowledges "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the Great Britain Air War."
A member of Corbyn's shadow government, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight program that he would have asked the leader of the Labour Party to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that he felt that the royal house should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's inner circle, claiming disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the policy differences regarding the party's position in the European Union and the government's subsidy ceiling have been "accumulated" even within the Labour Party since Corbyn was appointed.
Corbyn said at the meeting of the Trade Union Confederation that the Labour Party would propose a change that would remove the entire roof.
An hour later, the shadow government's Secretary for Employment and Pensions, Smith, stated that the party was "very clear" about the fact that they merely opposed the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26 000 to £23 000.
Corbyn becomes the fifth Labour leader to be met by David Cameron in the last decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has “forced” ideas into questions for the Prime Minister, and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Corbyn, a member of Islington North, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both witty words and scoring, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the financial secretary of the shadow government, will replace her during Question Time when Corbyn is not taking part - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the House of Commons President John Bercow on this issue.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theatre that was often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Hour has been an important measure of the leader's judgement, his control of the House of Commons, and his position with other MPs, although critics have criticized the question hours for becoming merely a caricature requiring far-reaching reforms.
Filmed in Joburg: Homeless young people trained as photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
I was shot in Joburg” is a not-for-profit studio in which young people who are homeless are taught how to take photos of their neighbourhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met with one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

Pounds rise as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers showed an increase in the UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the bidder SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK salaries, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of price increases.
The pound rose by more than one per cent against the dollar to $1,5505, and by 0.84 per cent against the euro to $1,370.
The FTSE 100 index closed with a 1.49% increase to 629.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share on the market and rose by 20 percent after competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9% after the encouraging news from the competing luxury product group Richmont.
The latest sales figures were better than expected, and also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore shares rose by 5% after the mining giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the index's largest calculators at 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1% after a sportswear company announced a six-month pre-tax return: an increase of 83 percent to £46.6 million.
According to JD Sports CEO, higher wages could damage expansion
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the UK, it could mean that “potential consumer purchasing power will increase”.
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill says.
The cost could be targeted at the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash launches a grassroots campaign against intrusion into Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trades from Aldi's attack in southern and western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in southern and western Australia before Aldi’s $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centres and the first deal early next year in South and West Australia, which will host up to 120 deals. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food retailers and build the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA’s retailers and suppliers have jumped in, and brands like Dunsborough’s ice cream maker Simmo’s offer tastings in IGA’s stores, and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defence strategy on 29 September, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and hardware will host an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot in the game, as South and Western Australia make up almost 30% of Metcash’s IGA trades, with a higher profit margin than the IGA network in the Eastern Länder of Metcash.
Shopping in Southern and Western Australia is known to have a perennial character, and IGA dealers have a much larger market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern states.
Analysts like Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will capture about 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the start of the first movement.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million in sales every year and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 stores in the west next year, generating $500 and $600 million in revenue in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash’s high fixed costs base can cost Metcash about $13 million in loss of profit before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, with its market share falling from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could “well possibly lose in a decade.”
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it is understood that a member of the board of Metcash would have contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and Metcash’s food and food business, which distributes products to around 1200 IGA dealers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, which indicates a reduction in the debt financing of operations when there is pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler stands by and has invested over $150 million a year in lowering prices of hundreds of products weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers renovate stores by increasing the rate of growing fresh food, and bringing on the market a better range of private label products.
Metcash’s CEO, Ian Morrice, says that lowering prices and improving stores have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Federation, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism for his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in the recent storm that has ravaged his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves credit rather than criticism for his own conduct, says Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian Tennis Federation.
The younger member of the talented duo called Special Ks, Kokkinakis, was unwittingly exposed in a case where Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly after that, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the chief judge was forced twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared: “Wawrinkan should have hacked Kyrgios, and I should hack that brat.”
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his racket after a cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been the unwavering defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another seat in the doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
I feel pretty strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into the brawl,” Healy said.
He broke his racket when he lost due to a cramp in the US Open, but he is not the first player to break his racket when he gets frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, also in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little harshly.
She is very mature to 19 years old, she works hard, fits in with the team and so on, and she has never had any problems with other players. She is appreciated in the dressing room, she exercises hard, is in good shape and is quite calm and a mature young man, and I think she should be judged by her merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in the important games starting on Friday, describing this ‘common decision’ as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the return of the Canberraian to the team’s standard fleet.
We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the polemics around [Cyrgios],” Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public to reflect on these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, holding back those who tried to enter the country illegally.
At the border there was chaos as hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral areas, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who have fled the violence of their home countries have now pitched their tents and set up an undefined road between inspection posts in two countries for an indefinite period of time.
However, frustration increased.
As the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants said, "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
Serbia’s Foreign Minister declared that it is “unacceptable” to return migrants from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels,” said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion on the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after a group of 28 nationalities failed to establish a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the allocation of responsibilities for the 40 000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece. The ministers spoke with hope of reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take on 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an additional EU summit next week to discuss the migration crisis on the continent.
Hungary does not, however, hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
Tuesday's emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to act in the crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country will also erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, not those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly opposed to that of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime the attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13 feet) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares an emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military position expected for next week, but journalists at the Associated Press border have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban’s home security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said the authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already gone further.
They got over the fence by damaging the fence, are now imprisoned by the police, and are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will repair the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points at the border with Serbia after they had sent a barbed wire-covered train wagon to close one of these points.
The main border crossing near Roszke in Hungary was covered with chaos as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to handle people and crowds shoved inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands remained outside.
A group of migrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to a national survey, Hillary Clinton's management of Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue to lead the two-digit Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders will catch her.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of democratic voters (down 58 per cent), while the second one, Sanders, is supported by 27 per cent (up 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will take part in the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton's supporters, however, stand behind their own choices more than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among a number of population groups since last month's CBS News Poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start with democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he is now on a par with Sanders.
Clinton, however, clearly leads the way with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the democratic voters in the country say they will support Clinton enthusiastically if she becomes a candidate for the party.
A quarter say they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not very surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 per cent of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number one Republican leader Donald Trump says the same thing to fewer Republican voters (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the appropriate experience (16%). After that, the most popular answers were that it was the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that he was the best candidate for the post (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being selected were also mentioned.
As the presidential candidate may be affected, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - although a third disagree.
When asked by democratic voters who they would choose as the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democrats, Hilary Clinton's management of Sanders will grow. If Biden joins, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he opts out, the figure will be 30.
55% of democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden is far behind in this respect, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most voteable has increased.
However, when asked what is most important about the candidate, democratic voters put their opinions ahead of the vote.
Also last month, no candidate or candidate for democracy was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in certain key issues among their party voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, reliable, and strong leaders.
Biden performs best on the three in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty per cent of democratic voters say Clinton is not honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent say they have no opinion of Sanders.
Democratic voters generally also agree with Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
Looking at all these issues, about a quarter of democratic voters say they don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal e-mail address and server while she is a foreigner still raises questions, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their general opinion about her.
However, it is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The views of the people were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that the email controversy did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
While Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters in the whole country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Among the six candidates in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
As a rule, Sanders is considered honest, but many do not have an opinion on him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in a study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
In the new survey, two candidates gathered half of all votes, leaving others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% on Tuesday to 27% on the previous CBS poll before last month's Fox News election debate.
At the same time, however, Carson rose from 6 to 23 per cent.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is ousting Trump among higher-ranking Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasichia of Ohio. The support for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has fallen most: from 10 % last month to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Governor Marco Rubio rank third in the 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest September survey is +/- 6%.
Last week’s latest CNN/ORC survey showed that Carson was on the rise in polls: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him at 32%.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson gained popularity last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgeon unnecessarily, even though Carso apologised for questioning Trump's faith.
We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the death of a student at a tribal shelling ceremony in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge has been brought against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi brotherhood of Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during the rite of membership in September 2013, and then delayed his admission to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with more than 13 kg of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled on the ground as he tried to walk through the icy field towards the goal.
In the end, Deng complained that his head hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng fainted, but, according to the accusations, waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact brotherhood's national president, Andy Meng, for advice," police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus put the welfare of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng," said Chief of Police Wagner.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng received repeated blunt object attacks on the head, body and thighs.
Too many families have been affected by the fraternity shelling since at least one student died each year since 1970,” said Doug Fierberg, a Deng family lawyer.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The great jury of Monroe County advocated that the first five members be prosecuted for third-degree murder
32 other members of the fraternity, including Meng, are also accused of violent shelling and criminal intrigue.
We don’t just want to hold individuals accountable. If there is an organisation behind the event that accepted the situation either officially or informally, they should also be held accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College denied the fraternity and the national fraternity broke its ties with the local department.
This is what happens when the U.S. central bank raises interest rates
Interest rate increases will come, and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise, and the economy will face a recession.
We know this.
What we do not know is how long it will take or how long it will take.
The past does not provide much assistance in terms of timing when it comes to the economy.
The recession has taken only 11 months since the first lifting, and sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the U.S. central bank in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the U.S. Federal Reserve officials have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but rather on the trajectory of time to normalise the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the interest rate hikes have been overstated.
The central bank’s first post-global economic boom will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, Capital Economics’ Chief Financial Officer for Global Affairs in a message to clients.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels to be such a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will respond based on past developments:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, waiting for an interest rate increase can make the situation unstable.
When an increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
It seems that the return on capital tends to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, possibly reflecting a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the central bank increase.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market is generally in a strong, about 14 % upward trend, 250 days after that, the situation is fairly flat (average 2.6 %) and the normal state has been reached after 500 days, with an average return of 14,4 % in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the leading capital strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on shares is usually more pronounced at a later stage of the growth cycle when returns begin to decline.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rate increases often contribute to their entry.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges that have not existed before, and that can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the case with gross domestic product, which will be close to its lowest ever level before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only been twice below 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6%, few believe it will remain, as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economic environment can be risky and raise the question of “is this time different,” Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants have been preparing for a central bank raise throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
While many of the strategies and financial experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trading anticipates only a 25% probability.
Our research shows that, since 1950, all the upswing cycles have so far appeared in the supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly since recovery has begun,” the report says.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has expected the longest period since the end of the last recession: a record of 35 months, and now it is already the 74th month.
The fixed return has also been volatile while the market is waiting for an increase in interest rates, and the model somewhat resembles the findings of capital.
The main difference is that as the central bank changes its policy, its effects are reflected faster in bonds than in shares.
The direction of bond yields seems to change immediately with the first increase/surgery of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the yield on the bonds will drop immediately,” Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that raising interest rates will bring about convergence between longer-term and shorter-term bond yields, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often produce better in such a situation, although “we are still wary of looking for returns,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-yield analyst at Schwab in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank’s policy expectations.
In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to a tighter monetary policy outlook,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more even, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
Generally speaking, companies with a predominantly U.S.-based business will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with a lot of debt perform worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have to finance.
History shows that ‘quality’ stocks are generally more profitable in the three months after the first interest rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in their customer report.
After the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases, companies with strong net sales surpassed the weak net sales companies by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than low-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable interest rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit with higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly the effect is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of the Classic FM, says Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the canal of ‘recognition’
He argues that its separation from the commercial competitor will become increasingly difficult
In addition, he received the BBC Music Awards, saying that they merely mimic the Brit Awards.
Member of Parliament Damien Collins criticizes The Voice, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is “becoming” a Classic FM, claims the leading political party, adding to the pressure of the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said to BBC executives that the public service radio channel seemed to "recognize" its content, and that it was increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "people-to-people" - is turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also starred at the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, only appear to be a British Awards gala under a different name.
So if you are trying to do something different, here are two direct examples I remember when you are actually just copying something you already have on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and information sharing for citizens.
Radio 3 teaches you things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first-rate.
I also think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, the BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than before to reach the public, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC’s offering criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins of the Conservative Tory Party criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and is by no means original?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, has been produced "in a rather BBC style".
He added that he wanted the production company to “find success within its own house” the next time it started a series of entertainments.
However, he refused to prevent the production of future seasons of The Voice, or to order that the money of the licensees be spent on other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was a rise at the lowest level since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales strengthened the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday could curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for more than a decade, turning many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a smoothing of online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew least since the start of statistics in 2000: only five per cent up from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a smoothing of online sales in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Looking back at the growth levels of previous years and returning to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more reasonable over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales strengthened as buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online and that they could be done in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it is leveling off, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday effect, imported from America, has been considered one of the reasons behind the slowdown.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the usual average, buyers flocked to their computers to grab deals, knocking down the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue over the findings, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds were spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on shopping streets.
Muslims bury Mecca's crane fatalities, Bin Laden's family's consequences
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse of the building giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed.
29 dead were carried through the streets in the air when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died when the crane collapsed in the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
Mainly white-dressed mourners filled the route to honour the first dead who made their last trip to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad procession passed the sacred place, where just a few days ago the crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and fell down worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden's family as guilty of a disaster in which 394 people were also injured.
Of the worshippers killed by the crane that fell in Mecca's Grand Mosque, 29 bodies were carried through the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton in the Manchester area, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that the Binlad Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision, published by the State-run Saudi Press Agency, stated that Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s directors are prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to investigate what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the crane, nor have its representatives been caught for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and of not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Mecca Grand Mosque, which are part of the huge building block led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi Arabian monarchy for decades and is leading major construction projects.
Osama bin Laden, the late leader of Al-Qaeda, was a rebellious boy whose family banned in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the deceased and permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says East European cheap workers are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants," Veronique Laury said.
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more professional Screwfix stores will be opened
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, city correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint brushes and prefer to hire skilled workers from Eastern Europe to do home repairs
It seems that if you are smart with a hammer or hook to paint walls, you are now in a minority.
The British are hiring more and more helpers to do their own work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, said that the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is behind the popularity and that they offer their services at a mock price.
This leads Kingfisher to plan to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single-woman households that do more home improvement work than before.
Laury said: “The majority of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women who lead the major companies in the UK FTSE100 index, and has reconstructed his management team with equal numbers of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with a group of exactly 50 percent of women, including its executive director and financial director.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the management team.”
Kingfisher announced the decline in both returns for six months and sales after the group took over the costs of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, the owner of Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The government of the three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation in order to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centre organisations began to be forced immediately, and as a result the country stands on Friday because of the widespread protest of workers.
Quite a few people think that then there is also reason.
The question is whether it is worthwhile to strike when things are going badly.
There is even a resistance movement.
More than 50 000 people have already gone online to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
This would have been impossible in the good old consensus time.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring a slander would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people by millions of members of trade unions does not take much time, but it gives rise to thinking.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay business, the government’s drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from the sky.
When things have seemed to roll by their own weight for years, now the unions finally get to the point, i.e. the rights of workers are being defended, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to captivate the role of the trade union movement, when membership in the trade union is seen to be more necessary than before.
Whatever you think about the activities of the organisations, it’s nonsense that Friday’s protest would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been declining for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
I think these things are forcing everyone's head.
The University of Lappeenranta has a hard time saving: The goal is to save 8.5 million, reducing the number of employees by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a savings programme with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operation negotiations for all personnel with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means a reduction of approximately 130 employees.
Another two million will be saved from other activities.
Underlying the negotiations is the 2016 budget, which anticipates an actual deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the cuts made by the government.
In this financial year, the university will make about 2.6 million deficit results.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding received from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university’s total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combination of massive cuts in teaching and research and a reduction in corporate funding at our university is very significant, says Anneli Pauli, Rector of the University.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the decline in complementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will begin next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks as prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail companies in the UK, says Souter.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
The first is commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the move.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus’ plans.
At least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail traffic in the rest of Europe, has expressed its interest in rail transport.
The U.S. central bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will follow when the U.S. Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters surveyed 80 economists a little over half of those who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and that interest rates are kept at the current level of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historical event, since the central bank cut interest rates to zero is seven years old.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get off the zero level and start normalising its interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has performed relatively well, and recovery has brought trillions of dollars to the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for withdrawal, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter filed an apology
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting his colleagues later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying she was "sorry" about the first murder and hoped to "cancell it", the authorities said on Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier Police reported that Delta State University geography and social science teacher Lamb called the emergency number at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me that he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said he had “killed his wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “does not bother anyone” but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell it.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss was found, along with a 45-year-old Lamb handwritten message saying: “I am so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 km to Delta State, where he killed his historical teacher, Ethan Schmidt, before eventually killing himself late on Monday when the police surrounded him.
Rector of the University William LaForge said there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, but that there was clearly something in Lamb's mind.
The authorities said on Tuesday that, despite the allegations published on Monday that Lamb believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, there was “no information or evidence” of any kind of “triangle drama”.
Shawn O’Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a “good person”.
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Steen reported that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was “shocked”.
O’Steen said that Prentiss and his daughter were “unfortunately best friends”.
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home online. Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
He always wanted to help other people,” said Knowles.
Police reported that Lamb had called his relatives at some point on Monday to tell them that he would not go to prison.
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car off the road, left it there and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb defended his doctoral thesis on education in Delta State in spring 2015, says a CV found on the University’s website.
The stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukaemia and in 2009 his long-standing partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
He was also reported to have had drug problems and was arrested in 2008 for possession of the drug.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw got a double fracture in his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defender remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno on the 15th minute after a 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for 9 minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, “He has a double fracture and is now in hospital.”
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day after, and then cut in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays brilliantly, and now it happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months and he doesn't play in the block stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee was mistaken.
You can judge yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot sticking.
Shaw said, “Thank you to everyone for your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery is starting now, I am coming back stronger.”

The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover from the June European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of such a disability, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played for the Mexican team Van Gaal against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
Moreno takes this seriously because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, that’s a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I did not see the situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible because of this, I’m so sorry.”
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know Lorax better?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long until you learn it almost by heart.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the prime minister about his favourite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss' The Lorax, a 1971 environmental story.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a post published on the SuperCamps website and continues: “Fun, mobile, creative and has a strong message. I enjoy reading this book for my children because it always seems to have an image or message we have not seen before.”
All this is true, but the next paragraph in which Cameron thought to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to fill the rather short original.
Inside the walls of the town of Needle, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted’s son hopes to win his dream girl’s heart by fulfilling Audrey’s wish to see the right tree,” the text says and describes a love story written by Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, the real name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this isn’t suspicious enough, Cameron’s text sounds as if it was taken from the plot summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database, which begins with the following: “In the city of Need inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even the air is merchandise, Ted’s son hopes to win his dreams for the heart of the Audrey girl.”
Given that Cameron is an active parent in public, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. In it, a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by greedy, tree-beating and needs-weaving Kerskanen, ignoring the short, mustache-like object Lorax, who “speaks for the trees.”
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesperson said that the text probably came from the office of the Chamber of Cameron.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at that time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined by the English team, but it was still a tough place
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see which team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think it’s likely that there will be a recurrence of the last 3-0 series loss.
I would not rule out any foreign profit.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it includes good twisters and the team’s mindset is strong: they don’t have scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is developing in his twist feeds and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England's cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his chief coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged by their results.
For example, there was no doubt about Joe Root’s choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs in Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England's chief coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform as well as he could, and it didn't surprise me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was elected seven times to the team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was able to play both at home and abroad.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes along and there is a batter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something we saw early this season in Yorkshire when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in the opener next to Cook has been scrambled, so that an extra pitcher could be added to the field, but four quick ones could be kept, and I am not against this.
I don't understand why the batter could hit there, and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moe may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is three for them and there is little difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games when the first lattice fell, before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup pitcher, and, as little as I’ve been dealing with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unpretentious statistics - hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and think it's gambling, but there aren't too many pitchers on offer and the pickers chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant to the games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest friends in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the white ball, bringing both energy and a relentless glimpse.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s playing or coaching, and he has the same exploitable stunner as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested on a one-day basis, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the chosen ones do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on light grounds.
Britain's exit from the EU (Brexit) may lead to a profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-wool renegotiation strategies for keeping Britain in the EU are facing increasing problems every day, even if he does not take into account even the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's election to the Labour Party's leadership or the indignation of the trade union federation in Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat recently explained that because the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of Britain’s self-centered agenda, full of dissenting concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which these countries largely do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade union federation decided that it would not want them if they eroded social protection.
We could call it Dave's and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, with or without the local eye, and then coming home saying they will win back the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside inside the UK EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says from Berlin - suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at such a point that they don't care about leaving.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her actions before it gets ruined in the same way that it did for too long for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande of France is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He too is a fading force.
Poland may soon have a national right-wing government, Spain may have a left-wing government.
It’s hard to see these countries sacrificing for the selfie Brits, when their energy would rather be aimed at preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – they don’t want that either because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even be consciously planning to make useless remarks in the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
The renegotiations were arranged” and “Renegotiations were of no importance to Britain.”
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press knows how to be and how EU-sceptic the press monarchs are, what they were not at the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our 1973 membership was confirmed by a 2:1 ratio.
They can vaguely recall Boris Johnson, the biggest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by spelling “EU direct bananas” as a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-enhancing rogues, phone-hacking foreigners, and people who have their registered office elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same about them, but realized that if you’re in a cage with a coveted gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of the deception, unless you want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairish than Blair himself when it came to discussing Cameron's renegotiation trick: Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back of me at the Westminster House on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-accepting Neil Franklin's 80's boycott of the Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
While it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not with me, but without a doubt with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC couch Corbyn on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he would like us to stay in a renewed EU.
Well, the majority of people outside of the Ukip war goal zeal and the most ferocious nationalists in the Conservative Party will certainly be able to stand behind this opinion.
Hilary “Benn, but not a fan of Benn” Benn said this both on the radio and on TV this week, when her inner patroller would have liked to admit that Corbyn’s election to appoint harsh John McDonnell as finance minister to the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his father-in-law struggled on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his government seat.
Hilary's struggles were more attractive.
But the fight for keeping up with the ‘situation anywhere’ – Benn’s statement – was not what McDonnell said, and from everything that Corbyn told the heirs and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24-hour television, and especially in social media vortexes, which is a suitable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corbyn's basic tour of EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a hard-to-understand discussion of left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal mischief.
As far as his duality with NATO is concerned (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to surrender), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have dubious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely useless?
The United States has already been somewhat disappointed by the British’s poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England's e-cigarette assessment
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency’s claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published this “pillar” report last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence”.
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial that attacked the "extraordinarily shaky basis" of the PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were ‘built on rock or sand’.
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say that the public expects that the PHE’s claim, “to the best of its time, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional tobaccos,” is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people, where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in a study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, a company previously reportedly funded by British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT’s public health mandate in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced that they had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not from the funding he was previously reported to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
There are no criteria for selecting panel members, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also report that they have received funding in the field.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Director of Tobacco Control at PHE.
The study produced by the group “substantially admits” that there is a lack of “controversial evidence regarding the disadvantages of most of the products and most of the criteria,” McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these connections or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s allegations that “there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, says that claims made in the BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says: “Electric cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking.”
Half of those who burn their lives die of addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively low, but we must continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence looks like and what it does not look like, especially when there is so much public uncertainty over the relative dangers of tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even if e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we meet our national responsibilities.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would “give anything” from hits like this soap set on Albert Square.
Johnson said that licensing fees should only be used to make programs that other UK broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs, which are likely to have a smaller audience, in difficult broadcast times against the most watched programs and channels of competitors, than the BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years.
I don’t understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programs that would suit clearly unsubsidised competitors,” Johnson said to the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its research on the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is kept - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this medium or in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programs that others do not do and produce.
The Voice will be sent to the main broadcast time, because the goal is to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would look like a show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why regressive tax should fund programmes that could also be funded without state subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, undeniably implemented inside the house.
Frankly, other channels would give any of it.
I don't understand how it's about a public service broadcast.
I don’t think it would weaken the BBC at all.”
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 in 2004-2010, said that the BBC is guilty of hunting for the number of viewers “because of the goals of the people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support.”
His comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's public service programs "are going to the BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC therefore meets its responsibilities and can then, when defending £4 billion in licence fees, hypocritically state that "of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that no one is watching."
They put them in a place where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the fee, Johnson said to the committee: “I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most value from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that £150 a year gets a lot of value, but I don’t know if it’s true for people for whom £150 is big money because they don’t spend much on the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its mission to “inform, educate and entertain” during the Reith era.
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as education - he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a model from the Australian and Canadian radio stations and change the mission to "information, education and entertainment".
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events like the Proms concerts, which, according to him, only show some on TV, and engage with commercial companies so that all of these could be viewed online.
Sound genetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems to control them with sound wave discharges.
The tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to be heard by the human ear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified movement nerve cells with channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Related: Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that the worms show the functionality of a new method called sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are transmitted to the human brain to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The nematodes do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they are surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles strengthened the ultrasound waves, which then go inside the worms.
Reinforced ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures that are present in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonically controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified worms, the microbubbles strengthened the sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they switched on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off nerve cells using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light that needs to be sent along optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unobstructed, so they can be sent to the brain from the head of the skull.
We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, it may be possible to temporarily induce target human nerve cells to react to ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment,” said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to your home!
Advertisements put the British arms trade to shame
Watch the video against Amnesty International's gun fair.
Terrible killer machines!
Footstools crushing ankles!
Grape bombs!
As well as electric stunning sticks that cause painful pain but do not leave any traces!
There is no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest gun fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to underline the British government’s willingness to trade arms for repressive governments at the ExCeL Centre in London.

A separate campaign also resulted in many posters for bus stops and metro trains, which require more detailed inspection.
Important information, Do you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?” together asked using the London-based font and brand, the DLR track changing into a tank image.
This September, a pack of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were exhibited at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Dismaland, Banksy.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using the “Ad Space Hack Packs” package. It is a six-pound pack of hex keys that, according to the collective, “access a third of the advertising space of the entire planet’s bus stops”.
Transport for London is not amused by this unlicensed ‘poster vandalism’.
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs Curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on the opposing fronts when they have realized that they need to go to the outside world if they want their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun poster greets commuters in the metro.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed over 100 000 times over the last 24 hours via Facebook, created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and background editor also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Leverin found that the gun fair was not advertised at all – and there was an empty spot in the ExCeL calendar at the time – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they are trying to avoid.”
They played with the idea of a more realistic obscure corporate advertisement, but “it was more stopping to highlight the issue with bright colours and animation”.
They have done a fantastic job helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair,” says Amnesty’s Tom Davies.
Now the UK government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the gun fair comes from within ExCeL when exhibitors are selling fantastically beautified products.
In a press release, Saab revealed that he had received an order from the US Army for an "at4CS RS" on the shoulder.
This includes a “unique pipe-laying warhead that targets excellent effects on the rear of the armour inside the object”.
Whatever it does, it is not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitory
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dormitory as an ignorant 19-year-old. At that time, I still believed in barrets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I annoyed - and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Much of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can be anything from nerves to completely frightening.
It’s tempting to talk: tell me where you came from, did you like a gap year and what you think about Corbyn, and why “I don’t really love or hate Marmite because it’s really just yeast extract HAHAHA finding me in my room.”
Take a breath.
And help others take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not the ones you don’t want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they share extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, film night venues and public venues, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don’t even imagine starting a university while in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of wandering from one room to another that is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell to someone who tries to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, “I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but now you have to leave so that I can recover the energy that I spent talking to you.”
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing - and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when the speech came: knock.
One type of student in my dorm was of the opinion that if the door was not locked, he had been invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Make friends through baking.
As you start the university in the peak of the baking trend, knocking on people’s doors with a chocolate pastry dish and introducing yourself seems to some extent less strange, less “welcome to the neighbourhood, bake something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions” from the 50s.
Providing self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your cohabiting partners feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they will combine your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk into your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they are boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy - but try to deal with it earlier than my dorm friend who mixed his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He is now in prison.
You should not make noise so that people are not allowed to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you are like that proverbial pot playing the pot.
The girl in my corridor asked her neighbour if they could play their drum and bass music quieter because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before making her own music roar, locked her door and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory with you?
Or, inversely, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you considered a dormitory partner your future spouse, teamed up, divorced, and then saw him every day and possibly lost all your common friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot dormitory partner isn’t really your future spouse, you could even try to talk sense down to yourself.
In the glamorous moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but is reversible in an instant.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not attach their property on a blue sticker to the ceiling more than twice.
Racist attack by foreign students in Kitee - house planned as reception centre in Salo
The foreign student residence was carried out on Saturday morning with a racist attack in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation facilities for underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping facilities of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time,” says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at the Kitee Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the Folk High School’s accommodation were bumped with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the accommodation’s windows, the police of Eastern Finland says.
According to Luukkainen, who is responsible for the education of young people in the Folk High School, there were an estimated ten people in the building under vandalism at the time of the attack.
It was a weekend and adults are free to move around, so some could be elsewhere," says Luke.
The Folk High School accommodates people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived underage asylum seekers.
All those in the messed-up building have a status.
Some students study in an adult education centre, some are in vocational studies, and some are studying Finnish," says Luukkainen.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police of Eastern Finland investigates the attack as an act of damage and a violation of home peace.
According to Lukeinen, there was a press conference for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here, and no one wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened,” says Luke.
According to Luke, the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected to be involved and had been on the road in a light car.
I think this is the main idea of a youth weekend night, when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," says Luke.
There is also a hospital in Salo where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident occurred last week.
MTV told about this on its website on Tuesday evening.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal report has been filed with the police.
15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of the people who lived in the building.
State stops Y-train for cattle - passengers annoyed, "just like an idiot"
Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karja will stop running in March.
The news was infuriated by the passengers on the train at Helsinki Central Railway Station at the beginning of the evening.
In particular, the landing strikes the Siuntio residents, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It’s just stupid, because the number of inhabitants is growing all the time and people in work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot depend on anything other than political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says in an interview video on HSTV that he will come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main line will be combined into a new R line.
The status of Purola in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes from which the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the next contract period.
The agreement period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will later be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that the state train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
Let's make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be remorse.
The Y-train is also used by people other than Raseborg and Siuntio, as it is fast and overtakes several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling farther away from the city area.
It's just bad for those who have to re-plan their trip," he said as he climbed the Y-train.
There will be a little relief.
A new train connection is expected to take the Y-train to the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL), which will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This brings additional costs to HSL, i.e. in practice to the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
We are now starting to investigate the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate costs.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y-train in approximately one million years, although the Ministry of Transport and Communications has done much more than that.
The R line on the main line misses two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of train services doubles.
In total, 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease to exist in the whole country.
The Ministry no longer purchases train traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
The number of trains will decrease on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year will be made with the stops, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring an annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book The Time of Capital: "It's worth exploring Marx"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakanen, who is known as the former Chairman of the SKP, in his book The Timeliness of Capital published today.
He is now being taken more seriously than he has for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalization and intrusion of the capitalist economy into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The author list of the book, based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen, also includes Professor Sixten Korkman, a distinguished financial expert at Aalto University.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is "now and forever".
However, is the former director of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Executive Board of the Finnish Economy not a Marxist?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a contemporary economist, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary expert.
The usual idea is that the history of ideas tells about the false opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the early stages of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
More relevant to Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
Now we are talking again about Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
Marx may be able to inspire those who want to understand the big picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
However, in his opinion, it is worth exploring Marx.
In the 70s, Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more so each other.
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weight of the past.
Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking - as well as other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war crimes in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a specialised court to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan civil war, the news agency AFP says.
A UN report on the Civil War between 1983 and 2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
At least 100 000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims either.
In particular, a major military attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report blames torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely to be men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have committed the coercion of bystanders and children as fighters.
Both sides have committed murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation on its own, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
The English yo-experiment was able to weigh social media
On Wednesday, in the autumn, there was a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16 000 candidates tested their English skills.
In the experiment, the subject could be written on social media.
On the basis of our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media made us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the text of the 150-250 words in English could be addressed to the editor of the advisory board of the online magazine.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the resting chair of Finnish Leelia.
She had to be asked how parents could look at things from the perspective of young people.
In total, there were four subjects for which one had to be selected.
It was the most difficult of them,” says Mia Lybeck, Senior Lecturer at the Swedish High School in Porvoo.
The third topic was just a quote from former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
According to Lybeck, the fourth topic was quite nice.
It had to write a fire speech on why companies should hire young people to work.
At least in our school, we have practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment as "quite normal".
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts that, for example, addressed the adaptation of the summer scale to climate change and the handling of large masses of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The writings of the autumn will continue on Friday, when it will be the second domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish exam.
In upper secondary schools, the experiment is normally held, i.e. it is not affected by the demonstration of employees.
The matriculation examination committee calls on the candidates to find a suitable meeting in time for the exam.
You can also get more time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
Trafficking with a gun in Oulu threatened
On Wednesday morning, a shop was looted in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and in a mask covering his face.
The man is normal-bodied and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the personnel with a handgun and had received a small amount of money.
The matter is investigated as an outrageous robbery.
Police prepares for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government’s cuts will clog up the city centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary information, tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK federations meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The task of working police officers is not only to carry out emergency tasks and other police activities, but also to secure the progress of the giant demonstration.
The roads leading to the railway station will be closed from the motor vehicles for about 9.30-14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, starting from the direction of the west from Mannerheimintie.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Senior Officer Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems that it is enough.
I do not take a stand on the industrial issues of the police.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the protest.
The police do not tell you the exact number of patrols.
There is some coming, but as a rule we can do on our own," Kujala says.
The police advises to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from early in the morning.
With the arrival of protesters from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They will not be allowed to enter the Railway Square.
Buses are basically quite far away.
The rest of the journey must then walk to the demonstration site," says Kujala.
The protest will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From the police's point of view, there is also a positive side.
The fluidity issue of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, will now be dealt with partly by itself.
The organisers of the protest have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to go peacefully.
The population is ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local protests will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's protest is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history,” says Martti Sisiinen, Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
As such, it is no wonder that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government,” says Sisinen.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also at those points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The hard grips of the government are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the trade union movement is actually trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday’s protests.
What is new now is the sharp division that the protest will bring about in the group that the trade union movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland protested at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday’s protest, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murtorstai, held in 1993, says Sisiäinen.
In the midst of the deepest recession, Murtorstai gathered together 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Aho’s (central) government is stumbling from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the workers’ organisations had never been as bad as during the period of Aho’s bourgeois government.
Now the relations between the government and the trade union movement may be even worse than in the days of Murro Thursday.
Besides, the Finnish bourgeois government is now in power very much, says Sisiäinen.
The current coalition of governments is still so interesting that it is so right-wing, despite the speeches of the Finns.
At this time there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The protest also halts public transport and possibly shuts down day care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the undistributed support of the workers, it can become the largest for many years.
In recent years around 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
There are all over them.
Traditionally, the Finnish trade union movement’s protests have been quite peaceful – even though the practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
The demonstrators are trying to avoid damaging or destroying the property, says Sisiäinen.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstrations changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs, and the police prepared to take on pork.
The firefighters' strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electric strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power and electricity strike in 1977.
70 000 metal men took part in the strike.
The strike was halted after seven weeks of the strike with a proposal from the Mediation Commission.
Metal workers received a 16 per cent increase in wages.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Breaking Thursday in 1993
On November 4, 1993, around 20 000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, gathered in front of the Parliament House to demonstrate their support for the work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
Firefighters' strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike in the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, the police were forced into a snowfall when farmers protested against the EU.
Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
Tons of snow fell to Spain.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass layoffs of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancies eventually accelerated the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors strike in 2001
Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of striking doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to a lively debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the Move in 2013
About 5 000 students marched from Senate Square in Helsinki to the Parliament building in 2013.
Central Criminal Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the central criminal police for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The cold truck had all been in good condition.
We have had information exchange with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility lies at the venue in Austria, says Tero Haapala, Director of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to YLE, which first told about the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company operates a restaurant business and its CEO is a man of a foreign background, who is about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested for human trafficking in Austria.
Captain who beats refugees, a former drug courier and a sublime businessman - the story of five smugglers
Magnificent king of smugglers, violent boat driver, style-conscious missionary and a taxi driver who sees himself as a good man.
Such people, for example, are involved in the smuggling of people into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist working at Trento University, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients", and their book, The Deathly Visitation, will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them right away
The Kerkna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer break.
For its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
Kerkna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for fishermen to transport people.
This is what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre-long wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can hold up to 40 people.
For one trip, Emir will earn about 8 000 euros after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him from all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis broke out again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that the customers stay alive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if you run out of money, that’s their problem.
Light bulbs turned off at midnight will enter the waters.
On the first night drive off the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves of 20 metres in height, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir leaves for the return journey.
Emir wants him to be feared.
That is why he beats his clients and at least claims to kill the hangers.
He says in the book that when the police once bawled him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
I took clients one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
He said he had to abuse his fellow countrymen for this.
I'll beat them right away, you think.
They need to be immediately shown who is here to determine.
Just a normal taxi driver
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine pulls its last and has seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi moves at all and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometres southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mainly accessible to families.
The men who travel without their families in the forests surrounding the city centre stay in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some also stay in private homes, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When people finally arrive in the Bogovaða area, a major hub of human smuggling, people are tired of death.
Goran's drivers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
They say their thing once and that’s enough,” Goran praises.
According to him, Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran does not like it.
Sloppy sloppy all the way.
For example, the price is set at €300, then they lower it to €200 and finally offer a price of €150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind man.
I am not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is three hundred kilometres, most of the motorway is comfortable.
I hear colleagues ask for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his riders a mile from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and whimpers away.
The work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Kampala, which hosts a large number of refugees from the Congo, as well as a small centre for helping Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business, where people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band on the white underside of the jeans looks elegantly under the low waist.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forwards to Europe.
The client will initially call one of the five telephone numbers of the Missionary.
He advises that it is advisable to arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money bluntly and slam among the merchants who cross the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee to the Ugandan authorities, it is necessary to tell that it originates, for example, from the war zones of North Kivu, and that it has been forced to flee its home from violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Missionary will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old identity card will be destroyed and replaced by another one.
The missionary's contact with the Ugandan police will help.
After that, the client is directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, to NGOs, and finally to UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He will charge for each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police will cost about one hundred euros, handling documents for humanitarian organisations about 150 euros, and the migration process, for example, to a European country of between 4 500 and 7 000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
A forty-year-old Irishman is on call on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They drive a motorway A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have to go to prison directly to arrange illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that, he's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the motorway to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the UK.
Tom chooses the right truck - you have to make sure it is heading to England rather than the Netherlands - and cut the safety wire for the protective cover.
It must be done silently so that the drivers do not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the action is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminium foil, similar to what is wrapped around a roast or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police's thermal scanner from detecting the hider.
Some people use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client's truck and leaves, hoping that the driver will not slam the passengers, at least before Britain.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world’s most famous human smugglers.
The sublime Turk has been called the marketing master and the undisputed king of the illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, who manages maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he knows it.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: Turkish ports are supposedly rented yachts to take American or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In fact, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported from Istanbul by land to a port and from there by sea to Europe for a fee of EUR 5 000-7 000.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are packed in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, it must be boarded quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive about 53 000 euros after the expenses for a luxury ship trip.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller agents to do the work for him.
During the summer season, there will be at least hundreds of transports and Küçük will earn millions.
He is thought to have bought land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he has apparently disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The book of the travel agency of death will be published this week, not next week.
The American Olympic runner talks about her illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times at the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
In her book, Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells about her career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the top of the class and ran the second best time in the qualifiers.
In the final, however, he was panicked.
He rushed to the top at the beginning and defended his leadership position on a manic run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his power was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him one after the other.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the goal line, says Favor Hamilton in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with other men.
He also overspeaked to his husband to accept his actions.
Prefer Hamilton's rate was €450 per hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
Another explanation by Favor Hamilton for becoming a prostitute was that she needed similar adrenaline rushes as she had had when competing in athletics.
Later, it was discovered to favor Hamilton that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former star runner came to light at the end of 2012, when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton took part in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world's first statistician at 1500 metres in 3.57.40, but was the last in the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion was delighted when the union put Norway's ski rooster under control: "Straight-backed"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
As in last year, Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been wringing over the sports contract all summer and autumn.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also not been a good fit for the many World Cups and Olympic winners.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the coming season.
The decision was commended by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski rooster under control.
Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the association," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the team so that he could promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that would also look after future generations, and would not let one athlete solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both economic and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I have been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own press release on Tuesday, in which he pledged that he would like to play in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup, as well as after the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals, including two gold medals.
Last winter, he was a member of the team that won the gold signal in Falun.
Fringe translators’ shield day will also be celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On 25.9. there will be events in different restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Frying Translators’ Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality food sector expertise and lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but that top-quality restaurants, which are inspected and classified by an impartial operator, can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of shield restaurants and the organisation.
In Vaasa, the day will be held in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
The Old Town restaurant will take part in the Kilpiday in Kokkola.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most important international events of the organisation, which will take place throughout the world during the same day.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of the Kauhava reception centre has been appealed to the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are co-operating to establish a refugee reception centre in the ex-Country of Kauhava, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent critical infrastructure of the crisis period in the area, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkkot Oy.
According to the Kauhajoki newspaper, the placement of a reception centre in the same building area would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area of the former Finnish Air Force Academy and the airport, the impact of which has also not been investigated in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
For the past two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (Ps.) and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of objecting to the reception centre in principle, but that the intended place in the former garrison area is wrong.
The City Board of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Administration means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions," Niinistö told reporters in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern to manage the refugee situation was shared by all the participants.
He appreciates the fact that in Finland, the government and opposition parties are able to discuss fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of the dialogue.
If it develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia can, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also touched upon in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia is told that the operations of airports will be managed by the management during the work stop.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes the streets of the centre of Helsinki
A demonstration on Friday will close the streets of the city centre.
The police report that the streets leading to the railway station are closed from cars around 9.30-14.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, cars will not be allowed to go to Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu in the direction of the railway station.
From Union Street, from the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be directed to Union Street at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people taking part in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tram drivers in Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers take part in Friday’s demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The association of tram and metro personnel told STT about this in the evening.
Most of the Alkia closes for two hours, including mail closed
Friday’s protest will also cause disruption to Posti’s services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross’ blood transports are handled despite the strike.
Meal deliveries as well as hospital deliveries and laboratory samples will also be taken care of.
Situational information on the services is available at Posti’s website.
Most of Finland’s Alko stores close on Friday for two hours.
Pam, a service trade union, has instructed its employees to stop working between 11 and 13 o’clock.
Pam has also urged workers in the grocery trade to take part in the demonstration of trade unions.
SOK’s and Kesko’s representatives tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open, if necessary, with the help of a supervisor.
According to Kesko, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual transactions.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
Helsinki day care centres do not operate fully on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency informs.
Due to the protest of trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day-care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of schoolchildren with intellectual disabilities and autism are normally organised.
The Finnish Early Childhood Education and Care Agency promises to inform more about the changes in its operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, various channels are needed in communications, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time,” Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches become repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on Yle’s channels in the future.
If other channels register as a channel, then we will look at it.
This channel is now being used tonight," Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that television and radio talk be given to citizens.
This whole issue, which is now being discussed, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That is why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast at 21.05-21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech will not indicate a more general inward turn of the government.
Is there an attempt to take the right to define the public debate more strictly into your own hands and refuse the public debate on the questions?’ says Professor Anu Koivunen from the University of Stockholm.
It comes to mind that Foreign Minister Soini's recent comment is that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these issues are not interrelated.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant at the announcement of Sipilä.
It would be strange if the media did not react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
The task of the media representatives is, by definition, to ensure that the agendas of politicians are not adopted.
According to Koivunen, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more that we have heard today?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old one, one has to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Even the general public takes a risk in this sense, if it is not a specific situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be labelled as a media for politicians or Parliament and the Government, which is certainly not in the interests of Yle or in the general line.
A clever bet from Sipilä
What the Prime Minister does not say is also important in the future speech of Sipilä, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, we need to look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what not,” says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuuti, TV talk is a clever bet from Sipilä, as this allows him to bring out his own view without gravel sounds.
This gives the message a large audience without a journalistic filter, as opposed to a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something about speech, because no more specific questions can be asked.
According to Kuuti, it is very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether the sweat is draining or shaking hands.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what needs to be done.
If Sipilä can present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to communicate something, because this is where a person speaks directly to another person.
This is what (U.S. President Barack Obama) and his partners do regularly.
Truly exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to be truly exceptional for citizens.
It has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns more sympathetic to the extortion ahead.
On Friday, wage-earners organisations will organise a demonstration and strikes against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow discussion on the speech.
SDP President Antti Rinne (sd.) announces that he will challenge Sipilä's dialogue.
Now there is no time for monologues.
Soon, six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of his discovery.
The boy has been found and OK, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The case is also confirmed by the Police Department of Finland in the Finnish Iltalehti newspaper.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he could no longer be contacted.
My father thanked all the people who helped me in my search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15 000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed by the violent fad of young people: You will get angry
Kurdistan MMA Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook, which specifically appeals to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani made a heavy speech against street fighting among young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and who came to Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking for an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account in which young people are fighting with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says that he is disappointed with the fad of young people.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62 000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick on the ground, sit on one another and strike without thinking about any of these consequences when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, the police officer of Helsinki, video games for social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and native Finnish youth.
It is precisely that you are fighting on the street in general.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, says Amirkhani from Turku.
Amirkhani points out that there are websites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become an outrageous number.
Little difficult, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be quite a long time guests here.
That is a slightly different way of thanking you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to racism, you will blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with it, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action contributes to racism.
You make me hate something that I don't like either.
You've got things pretty bad anyway and you're not going to improve them at all, Amirkhani concludes.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of SAK, says on Twitter that the Federation of Finnish Workers is considering its position on Monday on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Finnish Confederation of Professionals (STTK) announced that it would present its own proposal to the Government with a five per cent productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the Government will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest trade union organisation, SAK, soften its previous position.
Chairman of SAK Lauri Lyly commented on the matter in a sparsely worded manner on Twitter.
Lyly writes that SAK’s Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that agreements made by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä’s Government’s proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
In the past, Sipilä cut off negotiations on a social contract when SAK did not commit to the 5% productivity leap target.
Comment: A major demonstration threatens to pass - "It feels a bit funny to put up a fist"
After all, it feels a bit funny to put on a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere in the camp varies from side to side.
Is it to call the government to an end or to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's federal leaders spoke of holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened with arrest.
Uho also spread to the Akavas.
The teachers’ trade union OAJ threatened the closure of schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ argued that no school or kindergarten would be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), the chairman of the STTK, appeared in a conciliatory manner.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and prepared an alternative proposal for a five per cent productivity leap called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central Finland).
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder (Kok), hastened to announce that his paper has already been prepared.
There was no yard at the SAK office at first.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to agree on when the federal leaders just on Monday told him to put the country to a stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal by the employees, SAK should be inclined to accept a five per cent productivity leap.
It is no wonder that Palola STTK has relations with the Government of Sipilä.
Jukka Ihanus, who is responsible for the social impact of STTK, was previously a special assistant to the Prime Ministers of the Centre Party Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola says that the Board of Directors’ trade union expertise has improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola’s departure took a bit of a breath away from the Finnish halters, whose foreshadow is Marko Piirainen (sd) from the ACP.
After all, it feels a bit funny to put on your fist if you already have a paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, an autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July Helsinki Assembly.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union's sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to come to the meeting - a matter for which the President reminded journalists.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin said, according to Interfax.
Naryshkin’s criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, to which he had also been denied entry.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia uncomplicatedly, so Naryshkin continued to scorn Finland by praising and applauding Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the General Assembly of the European Union will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be hindered.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanerva, the leader of the meeting in Ulan Bator (Kok), who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
Lock meets real playoff troll: "Paints tight"
Killing and Lock will continue the oxen days in Hakametsä today, when both are on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no actual goal parties in Hakametsä today.
Yesterday, Tapatra went to Kuopio to drill for a 3-2 extra-time win over KalPa.
The rise was masculine, as last season's silver group was at worst out of a loss of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was more win-win.
The guests of Blues, who had started their catch tangibly, were round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any, the same game as last year, Lock-attack Janne Lahti predicts the layouts on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
In the previous two seasons, Tapatra has dropped in the semifinals from the final series of the Lock.
Both times a decisive seventh match is required.
Last season, Lock took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tapatra rose in the next three parallels and passed by.
With the exception of goalkeepers, there are no major changes in group compositions.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday will have a flute turn today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the lock posts Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of view: An ace is in a terrible play
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It is a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a film called Rocky, in which he played the lead role.
The underdog sent a sensational campaign to the world heavyweight Apollo Creed.
Rocky had great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a turbulent Cinderella story in Pori.
An unnamed and wood-handed potted box made it to everyone’s surprise in the Finnish finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Porin Mattia and Pele Peltonen.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
Hope became a blonde.
Great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the silver won.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The screenwriter Toivola believes that the novelty of this season works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports manager for aces has built a potty on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have battered jacks in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Copperinen are something other than disc games.
Toivola has forgotten that rock VI is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed Rautakallio into Sean Conner.
Rautakallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in his original 1976 book in Rocky, written by Toivola.
There is no rock in Iron Rock other than the nickname.
Rautakallio’s game philosophy does not include rushing and small-chicking.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Assänen Garret Stafford tackled the head of Tapatra's Jere Karjalainen.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I do not approve of such a game and it is not part of the ace disc, Rautakallio, which has become hot after the game, raged to the people of Satakunta.
The aces of this season's team are strangely built.
There are juniors, veterans, policemen and uplifters.
There are practically no key players of the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season’s events have an impact on purchases and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface is smouldering.
In 1953 Rautakallio was reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
Aces in the three league matches of the season have an equal number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivolan would not have supported the scripted sequel.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santapuk
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I play my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanna’s ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but for the first time, Olga plays under Tuukka’s direction.
Olga's role in the film You Make Us Beautiful, which tells about the early years of Apulanta, is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapukki, Sirkka.
Sirkka supports his son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my real example of Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He is a great type and I am grateful to Tuukka for having trusted me in the role.
Olga had already met Sirkka before the film project, but since then the duo has converged a lot.
They have met, talked on the phone and communicated.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We have gone through a lot of their history from different angles.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is a drama and the truth may need to be slightly coloured.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the 90s, there was a recession and a real bleakness.
There was a fairly small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirkka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuukka since she was a young man before her film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
So, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, then how much parents really know what you are doing.
Olga reveals that her youth was completely different from Tuukka, known as Heinola’s notorious skater.
Olga was a day-to-day girl who had nothing to do with the film Tuukka.
At most, he could have been enamoured in secret.
According to Olga, she has collaborated so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that a large joint project does not frighten her.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the whole production group goes to Heinola for a month.
The couple living in Iitti, however, often plans to drive home for their young children for the night, because the distance is not too long.
We will take over Heinola for a whole month.
They have warmly welcomed us, just asked which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 becomes the most expensive play film in Finland
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
The filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the science fiction film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive drama film in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been at Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The ongoing Angry Birds animation will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, as the film’s budget is over 100 million euros.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, starts in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will go to Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I've been sick and relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the film should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It is great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the public," he tells Iltalehti.
The budget for the film was originally planned to be 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
The budget is big, but there is a big story.
However, 100 million people could be intruded into the film because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything has been twisted so tightly that there is no slack at all.
The film’s production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond on Wednesday, paying an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest after two years, the company will pay back the loan.
Actors in the film include Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The fronts of trendsetters have recently been decorated with large logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or t-shirt was seen as something of a juncture.
But times are changing.
Sport has become a true fashion megatrend, and so have old, well-known sports fashion brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often, the boundary between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already really junta, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. fashion, where trendsetters were surprised by favouring as boring basic clothes as possible as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Instead of the grey basic college, the sweatshirt buried at the bottom of the cabinet is now worn with the manufacturer’s logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas’ recognisable track nets, favourite team shirts and New York Yankees caps have also made a comeback to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the bottom of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sport brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breast of the Versace autumn shirts makes it clear what brand of clothing it is.
Would you be ready to show the logos on your dress?
The Russian politician released the proof: I didn't get stuck for hours in the tank door!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 presented Russian war industry products.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page, in which he seems to be looking out of the door of the armoured vehicle in a very good mood, and at least not based on their pictures, it's all about getting stuck or angry.
Total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, but it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army television channel that he had admired Russia's new technology at the show, because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the tailgate, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all tanks and all tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also insulted the journalist who wrote about it as a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and heavy, but nothing like that that that I would be stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen," he told Russkaja sluzhba novosei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photos of the alleged jam have been published, even though a total of 50 000 people visited the gun show in a few days.
The allegation of Zotov's jamming started with a story on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told that he was hanging out of the tank door trying and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his pint.
The Bloknot website later published a follow-up article in which the organisers of the exhibition told their own views about the event.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers jump quickly out of armoured vehicles.
But the lawyer Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said Alexander Pisarevski, the exhibition coordinator, to Bloknot.
Here is a favourite item of interior bloggers
The candlestick of the two architects Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen from 1962 looks like it was designed today.
A cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and that is what it was originally.
Architect brothers are known to have refined the shape of the candelabra for a long time and with mathematical precision.
It was first introduced only to the gentlemen's esteemed guests.
Kubus candle holders are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of renowned brothers.
The candles are hand-made in eight, four and one candles in four different colours in Holstebro, Denmark.
Kubu is available in black, white, nickel and copper.
The candelabra is now topical and suitable for a wide range of homes.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilä mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand basin to the ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
Usually, the water is pumped either for reuse as process water or, as permitted, passed through the surface drain field to the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
Leakage was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the dam structures of the basin.
The company says that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Danske’s Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
Finland’s country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed for comprehensive structural reforms in order to solve economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime compensation and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäki, Chief Economist of Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are small differences.
The IMF’s assessment contains a lot of messages that support the government’s actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to Taloussanomat.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be carried out as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to have a 0.4% growth rate for this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects growth to be zero this year in its new cyclical forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention has been paid to low industrial confidence or other so-called softer metrics.
However, differences are only a few percent decimal places.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appoints new director
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is no surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for tracking Iwata's footprints, estimates Hideki Yasuda Reuters, an analyst at Ace Research.
Kimishima’s mission is to involve Nintendo in mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread on the traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children have disappeared every year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of underage applicants disappear every year in Sweden.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear "under the ground" per year?- A total of 156 asylum applications were filed in Finland in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were submitted and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelma says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue to process the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were rejected because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past 123 years, he says.
Is the amount on the rise?
By 6.9. this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for single minors.
There are no overall statistics on the number of missing minors in asylum seekers this year, but the number of underage applicants is known and has clearly increased, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What will happen to those who have received the decision to convert?
Will they disappear as well, for example, in the "dark labour market"?
It is difficult to assess this from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the decision-making process.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered immigrants.
He has taken action.
Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the meeting of the EU Home Affairs Ministers, reported on Monday on practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see photos of the equipment
The equipment used for TV and radio productions by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media sector who has lost his ability to work due to medical attacks, is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells devices on Huuto.net, which were once one of the most advanced professional tools in the industry.
The online magazine Iltamakasiini was the first to announce the announcement.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been left behind by technological developments.
In the digital media world, television programmes for Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interest will be found.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date, but these are still needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbyists - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move out of its current home.
We cannot take all the goods with us.
I have slowly started to inventory and see what goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
Own use of TV and radio equipment is no longer available.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man who has had a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life’s work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited a box store to collect films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to become more crowded than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the metro and trams will decide today whether they will expand their efforts in connection with the Friday protest.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the duration of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop all day.
Pekka Hirvonen, Chief Trustee, says that the echo is great in the field.
The cuts in night and shift allowances are severely curtailed by the drivers, so the government's plans to reduce the number of allowances raise opposition.
Hirvonen thinks, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stops on Friday, public transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area will be almost completely stopped.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
On Friday, there will be no local or long-distance traffic.
Trains departing before the morning drive to the destination stations.
According to HSL’s data, most of the buses remain in the depot.
Members of the ACP will be absent from work on Friday from 3am to 3am on Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by a supervisor,” says Pirkko Repo, HSL’s spokesperson.
Repo says that HSL will not be able to say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Employee organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move on to Europe, says news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas - teacher thought self-made bell was a bomb
In the United States, in Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after a teacher considered his school-bred self-made clock a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to introduce the output of his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were summoned, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed in a youth detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made a watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police said the clock looked like a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days of compulsory school leave.
His father is furious about the incident and the country's American-Islamic Council wonders if the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is raging - Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The right-wing press has also shared Corbyn's own labour party.
This has offended the public," said labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview with the BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's commemoration commemorated the battle of the British Air Force pilots against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in an official statement and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots' participation in the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
Corbyn's election as leader of the party has divided the ranks of the labour force.
Especially among the MPs there are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn advocates unilateral disarmament, the abolition of austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
Corbyn is due to appear today for the first time as a party leader in Parliament during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the end of the week, Cameron announced on Twitter the election of Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families," the Prime Minister said on his own account.
The cause of the family killing in Minnesota remains unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit
South Lake Minnesota Police have been investigating the family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later the police confirmed that Brian Scott Short, 45, was the father of the family.
After firing a shotgun at his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in a garage in the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found the Short family dead across the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million houses and a successful company
The South Lake Minnesota Police Chief Michael Siitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood acts is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created a fortune for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short reported that there were four million different visitors to the site each week.
I have received 50 bids from the company over the past ten years.
I have rejected all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I will sell the company, but not yet.
The success was reflected, among other things, in the fact that the Short family bought a magnificent house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate site Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also enough garages for eight cars.
A lawsuit pending
According to StarTribune, the father of the family was still waiting for a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers a variety of prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no defamatory comments had been removed from Short’s website, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short’s business.
Vesku Loiri offers coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month prize at the trotting event.
This is great, Loiri commented on her high note.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned €100 000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the big competition.
I still do not think it has happened.
According to Loir, Korpi, coach of a successful horse, gets full peace of work when working with a horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I keep my mouth shut, Loiri shook.
A stunning gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadian superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital press release, it is the largest individual donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising activities for the next seven years.
Subban signed an agreement with the Canadiens eight years ago and worth $72 million.
Subban's donation is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
Subban receives a lobby space bearing its name from the hospital.
In the past, Canadian players have made significant contributions to local hospitals.
A year ago, long-time Captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city, which provided the PET scanner needed for cancer investigations.
You can order a wife from a Japanese café for the evening - serve only a bikini and an apron
Themed cafés are a big deal in Japan.

The website provides you with all the information on the length and weight of your wife candidates, whatever type of bed they prefer.
Soon, 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: preparations for attacks against car security began
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to Intel.
The Board is made up of top experts from all over the world in the field of security.
ASRB researchers will conduct continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of best practices on cybersecurity.
In the future, the company will update the report on the basis of the ASRB report.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting company, estimates that by 2020 about 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same assessment, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars," says Chris Young, Intel Security Director.
With ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been waiting for years as the moon rises.
Finally, the car is also starting to be in sight in Finland.
Ford announced the RS data now that the car world is looking at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new all-wheel drive RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds with a maximum speed of 266 km/h thanks to its 2.3-litre 350-horsepower engine.
Finland is also interested in the price, it is reported to be 52 000 euros.
The car can now be ordered, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you in its announcement.
The favourite brand Kia introduced two new cars at the Frankfurt Motor Show - the new Sportage and Optima
One of the most important of the two novelties in Finland is the new fourth-generation Sportage, where Kia plans to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The Sportage, created under the leadership of the new European Design Director, Gregory Guillaume, is rounder than ever before.
The wheelbase and external dimensions have reached the other centimeter here and the car is splitting air more efficiently.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
More information on Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be provided closer to sales.
We have to wait a bit longer for the new Sportage to arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty does not seem to have changed, but it is a completely new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
Start with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate with the arrival of Optima GT with a 2.0 litre turbo engine.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima Farm will begin.
Chisu returned to the stage - sparkled in a bold uniform
Singer Chisu participates in the Life for the Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue trousers have an impressive, open neckline.
The outfit presents the graceful waistline of the singer star.
The whole is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has lost her pregnancy weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Going back to the stages and getting up in front of the public after a long break doesn’t really bother me.
I miss everything I do about music, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release her fourth album, Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style astonishes again - now you can see the chest
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives talks one after the other.
She shows off her gynaecological belly and breastfed in softly sexy clothes, last night at one o'clock in America, when she and her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, left her husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent on the breasts.
It reveals the skin colour under the dress when the flashes.
The last time she was wearing an amazon-like maternity dress was when she went to a friend's house for a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was accentuated by black overknee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last Friday, when it was the introduction of a pregnant stomach.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamor and champagne celebrations.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths about the model business.
The magazine "Harpeer's Bazaar" gathered Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you had posed for top designers in the previous season, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces in the industry, competing for work with veterans.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and it can take a year for the hotel to have a hotel or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their designs.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There is not just one sort of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to lose pounds, but Paris then says that you are too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
At fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion week ends, the difference is bitter.
The models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are devastated by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a show of clothes.
The models also want to be their own persons.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their next year’s collection.
Scrooge Salminen plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Scrooge Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the founder of the band Apulanta, based on the early years.
Latula founded Apulanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I am a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I play a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I did not want to meet the real Antti before the filming because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown person in this group, so I think it’s good that I only learn his playing style from video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a person.
The man who runs the Scrooge Salminen and Dogs band does not play the role.
The punk manes come naturally according to the man.
In the punk section of the stars, many certainly saw a foretaste, as well as if they have ever been to our shows.
Our appearance has never been anything small, but always goes to the fullest.
In 1993-2004 Tuukka Temonen directed the bass at Apunta, the main actors of the film You made us beautiful was released today.
The band's core group, which has become familiar to the general public, is played by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a hint of his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously announced on Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already posted a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in whiskers and chin beards, has shaved his face to smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair to black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling you about it at all?
There is no need to force the matter, a member of the SPR crisis team, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected and not be allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in the mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has come across TV news about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is a good idea to discuss the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he or she is afraid of.
A child should not be intimidated unnecessarily, even if he or she is distressed and frightened.
A smaller child closely follows the behaviour of his or her parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child feels safe as well.
Older children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to discuss the matter with them if the matter concerns the child.
The fact is that not everyone in the world is doing well.
Parents, together with children, can think about how our family views this.
In the end, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand: If the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This may be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
Your own forces at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
Hard to control the spherical lightning that strikes the vermo
Perttu Pohjola was able to fine-tune Apila's ball lightning in midsummer.
It only trotted victories and second places until at the end of July there was a collapse in the trots of Tampere.
Since the stallion was completely clotted, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of protection from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not at its mildest end, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
As Apila’s Ball Flash had to exercise lightly, the Nordic Region says it was pleasantly surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was the second SE-mama after Taruntuuli in its record time in Turku.
The Clover’s Ball Flash was under great pressure from the break when it had been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, the small deflection at the end was understandable, the Nordic region says.
The coach assumes that the proper competition made the stallions sharp.
The horse's vigor certainly went from there, and hopefully it would have been evened out.
Clover's Ball Flash has been a so-called humorous horse.
When it has not been amused, it may have been able to throw fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallion has been detached from a flash that the opponents have been amazed.
In the long run, co-competitors will not be able to cope with the ball lightning, from which even warm-blooded rides will be removed.

That's why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple’s iPhones may sometimes be removed in the future – but not all of them.
Apple plans to remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, says Tim Cook, CEO of Buzzfeed.
There are a number of programs on Apple’s iPhone that are relatively few to use: FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stock Exchange, podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple software is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to someone else on your iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems elsewhere on the phone," Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating, because the company does not want to waste memory space on users’ iPhones.
Eurozone inflation slumped to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, by 0.1% year-on-year, according to Eurostat, the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% estimate a few weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, inflation stood at 0.2%.
In August, the so-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9 per cent from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of underlying inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than a year ago.
In the EU as a whole, the average inflation rate in the 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Of the euro area, consumer prices rose most, i.e. by 1.4%, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest at 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent down on the EU's harmonised price index.
Euro area inflation remains persistently far from the European Central Bank’s (ECB) target, which is an increase in prices close to 2% in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% in the euro area for this year.
Next year, the increase will increase to 1.1%, the central bank predicts its release at the beginning of September in its new inflation forecasts.
US Fed to try to tighten monetary policy
The next US recession will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly in three years after the Federal Reserve Federation starts to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the downturn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it might start raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed on at its fastest by next autumn, and as a financial market price rumble before that.
Or at least that is what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets function as they used to do - and if they react to the tightening of the Fed's money taps as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker of Deutsche Bank's London market research strategies in their extensive research on long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies behind the study and report do not believe they know exactly when the Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they use their cool facts and calculations to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and since the Fed interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they look at what key economic and financial market variables are now on the same or different pattern as at the time of previous interest rate hikes - and what might result from that.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more shaky condition to bear the rise in interest rates than they were before in the 1950s.
A year may not be the beginning of a recession
The leaders of the Fed’s monetary policy and its respective stance have all hinted over the past summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for interest rate increases.
The first interest rate increase in more than nine years can take place this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter for its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds interest rate was in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small interest rate hikes of 0.25 percentage points over a period of two years ended, with the Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial market symptoms began in 2007 with the most risky housing financing problems in the United States, and a year later, the financial crisis broke into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
The last time the financial markets and the real economy were hit harder than they have been since the previous Fed interest rate hikes.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the world's largest economic ups and downs, as well as financial market trends since 1950 and in some places since the early nineteenth century.
The Fed’s interest rate hikes and their economic and financial impact will be reported from the 1950s onwards.
The fastest period since the start of the recession is less than a year, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
Since the early 1950s, the Fed has increased and decreased its key interest rate by a dozen cycles.
Each time has deviated from the others in some respects, and there are relatively few times in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude with any certainty about the effects of the following interest rate hikes.
The strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
And not only better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be undisputed, even with decades of research.
But there are three factors that lead to the crisis and increase its destructive power, which are perhaps indisputably clear:
1) In the 2000s, the Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks kept their interest rates too low for too long.
They patched the traces of the technobubble, and at the same time raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulation of debt in different parts of the financial and real economy, and the already excessive amount of debt, increased even further under the influence of central banks’ excess monetary policy.
The biggest debt bubble in the history of the economy so far was born.
3) In particular, the almost undistributed crazy debt financing in the financial economy swelled the largest exchange rate bubbles in the history of the financial markets from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
There is hardly much controversy about this, either, that the financial markets, rising to heights due to increasingly complex leverages, were in a very dangerous and volatile situation when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
The financial structures tuned to leverage, let alone valuation bubbles, could only last a long time after interest rate increases had begun and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give rise to criticism, for example by mentioning the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter even longer than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for longer.
2) Indebtedness has for a long time not been crazy cheap as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt burden in the financial and real economy has not eased, but now the debt burden in different parts of the economy is much heavier than before the financial crisis or ever before.
3) Liquidity from central banks has largely remained in the financial markets, and has lashed the most important securities and assets to the most expensive ones, either before the financial crisis or ever.
And not only do the strategies latish the atmosphere with financial market warning signs, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades since the heaviest recession to the model it has seen in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but similarly, the pressures and risks on the financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next begins to tighten its money taps tighter.
Perhaps the future image of Albert Edwards, the strategist of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it might seem.
For some time now, he has been preparing the Bank’s international investor clients for Fed’s following translations:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out - and soon it will be time for the Fed to rush to extinguish the financial blocks with even larger QE cash syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to reduce up to 33000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are directed at HP’s corporate services side, the company says.
HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., a PC and printer company focusing on corporate sales in November.
HP had the highest number of employees in 2011 when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, the number of personnel was reduced to 302000.
The company recognises one-off costs of EUR 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 25000-30000 employees.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
Last year, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system on your iPhone after Apple’s update release
To request a new operating system, go to the Settings app, click “General” and then select “Software Update”.
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems with this installation when a “Software Update Failed” error message appears on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update through the iTunes program.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include deleting apps to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests the apps to be deleted and then reinstalled when the update is complete.
It is advisable to make sure that the phone is charged or near the charger during the upgrade, so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery is running out, it may result in the update being broken.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the Board of Directors of a tax haven company
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Centre Party) has acted as a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company, Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner herself says that she has filed a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked and it is enough to have filed a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, says Berner in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served in the Government of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Government of Kährs and in the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs’s holdings in Luxembourg go through a multi-tier ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs’ second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to take care of the benefits of the capital of a Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the income from the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this connection,” says Berner.
Berner says to Yle that the ownership of Hartwall Capital in the company is not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in a tax haven is due to the fact that the largest shareholder of Kährs, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
The first reception centre for adult asylum seekers is opened in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants as early as this evening.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which specialises in the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agreed on security arrangements for the Centre.
STTK is preparing an alternative working life tightening package
STTK is preparing an alternative package for the tightening of the government’s working life.
The organisation also wishes to include other employee centre organisations.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, attention is currently on Friday’s protest.
The alternative means of reducing the cost of work will then be reinstated.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday, Palola pointed out to journalists during a break from the administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not ready for discussions.
STTK’s economists have calculated that the change security included in the Government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if a party is very keen to have a conversation if there is a one-hundred relationship on the receiving side.
Palola: Negotiating link has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) has requested alternative proposals by Wednesday, because the Government is then to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing for reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue with the government exists and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, the cutting of Sunday supplements is a painful place for the field of STTK.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation that it would be implementing some of the blackmail.
According to Palola, it is not warm for the alternative package to be prepared with the SDP.
On Friday, the employees will meet in Helsinki to oppose the labour market tightening package presented by the Government last week.
As part of the package, pay for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
STTK emphasizes that the central organisations have invited workers to protest, and the aim has not been to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder praises
Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, thanks STTK for its announcement on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now on the same lines as Akava, because Akava has for a long time been outlining an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, hopes that Lauri Lyly will join SAK in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a five per cent competitiveness jump as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks,” says Sture Fjäder, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on the Akava lines, as the STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers in the country,” says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau meets on Thursday at 15 to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
The same boat, the same coal, the same volunteers" - playing bingo when Sipilä talks in the evening
University of Tampere Green Left
Vivan bingo voucher for the green left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously delivered exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä uprising and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the Yle channel on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister’s last speech, it is necessary to go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister of Finland when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers made several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation War.
In the 1990s Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train operators by televising.
Single-calling, the monarchist spirit
Sipilä’s speech has been the subject of criticism and speculation all day about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow discussion of the speech".
According to Greens Ville Niinistö, "a single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned the "monarchist spirit: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä’s dialogue: “Nearly six months after the election.
Not a single appearance in the media from the Prime Minister with the opposition.
It has been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public Service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on by SAK’s Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK’s CEO Jyri Häkämies.
The public has been criticized for presenting Sipilä’s speech.
We considered the matter and noted that it is a public service task to promote public access throughout Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle’s publications, in the news.
Like us in the time of the oak trees
The speech has also provoked tantrums.
At the end of the evening, the dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are combed and dressed for their best.
The mother wears a pretty dress and the father fits the tie around her neck.
At 9 a.m., we are still on TV as we used to do at the time of the Tammeloids," writes the blogger Saku Timonen.
In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also explains why the Finnish government is settling in tax havens with millions of people hiding their capital, who are making amnesty laws for their fellow tax evaders, and at the same time claiming that it is necessary to cut the money when the state has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has published a bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear about the same boat, the common coal, living in debt and team spirit in the evening?
The tickets and pens are ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: West rejects Russian proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected the Russian offer to give up the power of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, says President Martti Ahtisaari to the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan whereby al-Assad would, after a while, have resigned in style.
However, the West did not adhere to the proposal because it believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Thurkin listed three points in his bilateral discussion: the opposition was not armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately connected and al-Assad's renunciation had to be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Churkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what to do, Ahtisaari remembers in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says that he delivered a message from Thurkin to the United States, the United Kingdom and France, but nothing happened.
Churkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all agreements with which he would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speech, because his experience shows that Russia was never ready to discuss al-Assad's fate.
Russia has officially supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that the Turks spoke under Moscow’s authority.
If he had told me about Thurkin's speeches, I would have answered that I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's trick to hold power over one of al-Assad's supporters.
The flow of refugees from our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7 500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own act.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Asylum seeker's centre in Tornio
The asylum seeker organisation centre, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the building of the Tornio Joint Lyceum, which is empty in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the Ministry.
According to Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio Sauli Höppinen (left), this is not the case.
When the whole council was not in session and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting to next Monday to decide on the matter, he specifies to STT.
Thirty-six of the 43 delegates were present at the meeting.
The organizing centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
On this basis, one could expect the decision to be positive, says Höppinen.
Mayor Timo Nousiainen said the city got in touch on Monday, and they responded quickly.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers could be accommodated at a time.
The expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party), half of the public holiday allowance would only cover part of the reduction in the price of work that the government is aiming for.
However, the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations succeed in reaching such an agreement.
In Parliament, Sipilä told journalists that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for substitutes for the labour market blackmails announced by the government.
If such an agreement arises, we will certainly welcome it with pleasure as part of the overall package.
According to Sipilä, halving the holiday allowance would work as a means, as it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government’s planned Sunday supplement cuts.
Labour organisations could agree among themselves on a cut in holiday allowances, as they have been recorded in collective agreements instead of the law.
The Government is currently reporting to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a government communication next Wednesday.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work will then start, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become more and more difficult.
Now is a good time.
It won’t take long for such things to happen, if there is a will,” Sipilä said.
The list published by the Government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of the Epiphany and Helatorstays into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, pay for the first days of illness is cut, overtime compensation is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and holidays are shortened.
The reforms will be implemented as mandatory legislation past trade unions, which has provoked strong criticism.
On Friday, a major demonstration will be organised by the employee centre organisations, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the expansion of the warehouse in the hamracic hall
The Tohmajärvi Council unanimously approved the expansion of the Nordic Koivu Hall, which is the warehouse of the stomach hall.
The criticism was due to the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than had originally been discussed.
There is also a busy schedule.
It was also slightly wondered that the need for space was unknown a year ago when the decision was made on the previous extension.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock by 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk on the agenda of an investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, but at the meeting, the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the estimated price would be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it would bring work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays for the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Location of Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Board relaxed its earlier strong position to bring Karelian street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct, considering the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there is no historical basis for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no street name signs in the city centre in the Karelian language.
However, the City of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, also prepared to use the Karelian language, for example, in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language should also be viewed in a broad sense now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still the region’s speciality, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be used for various marketing purposes in the province.
Stopping train connections cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections hit the county’s vitality with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And that has an impact on the ability to live and work here at all," says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also points out that air transport, the continuation of which has also been discussed several times.
It is important for the whole region that our opportunities are not reduced by the measures of the state, as is now the case.
We should look at the effects of the closures of these transport connections on employment, for example," Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to have students and employees,” says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor mobility also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market the university to Western Finland because the connections are weak in the transversal direction.
Currently, about half of the students of the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu became one of the gravel voices for the Siu war
The views of the Joensuu City Board on the regional Siun sote project seem to be unanimous, but there is also one gravel sound among them.
The City Board member Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the photo) presented the resignation of the entire project at the Government’s Monday meeting, but his proposal was no longer profitable.
The Government approved the Mayor Kari Karjalainen’s draft decision, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although less than one train.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains will be left out, but five times a day you can still get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to the state's austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ rail transport purchase money for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes stop altogether.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys climbed onto the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys shook off
The rescue department let a 12-year-old climbed on the roof, who could not come down from the roof on his own.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys went down the same route, but one did not.
As a result, others were shook off and the passers-by alerted the rescue department to help with the draw ladder to safely return to the surface of the last roof.
FedEx doubles operating profit, lowers tax outlook for 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast, as a result of lower demand for freight services and higher ground service costs.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent at the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the end of the tax year in May to result in $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook, despite the average price increases of 4.9%, came into effect on 4 January, and despite the higher surcharges that started in November for the transport of heavy or large parcels on land.
The company said it expects the operating profit to continue to increase from the previous year, as they have cut costs, turnover has increased and the e-commerce market is growing.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “will perform steadily, taking into account the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade.”
Plans for salaries for the holiday period were announced the day after a competitor UPS announced that it was planning to hire 90-95 000 extra employees, about the same as it did last year.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
Profit per share came at $2.42, which is left with an average forecast of $2.44. A survey of 12 analysts conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In the Zacks survey, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been suffering from a decline in international priority transportation that has halted its Express unit’s revenue development.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved the results of the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of the land unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenue from operations was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
Express unit revenues were higher due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight operations decreased due to higher labour costs.
In the opening auction, approximately an hour before the opening clock, the shares of FedEx fell to $3.85, or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed a 11% drop for this year and a 17% lower than the June 11 record.
This week, the U.S. central bank’s decision makers are sitting around a huge mahogany table for two days in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the nation's financial interests above all else.
Congress has put two responsibilities on the shoulders of the Central Bank: to maximise employment in the United States and to keep prices stable.
However, since the Great Depression, the Bank’s executives have accepted that there is also a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is this third requirement that can be decisive in a public decision on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the record-breaking incentive brought by short-term interest rates that have remained close to zero since late 2008.
While most of the data shows that the economy is growing steadily, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets may have made the already cautious central bank officials increasingly timid as regards increasing volatility.
Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be monitored,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief financial expert at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
However, I believe that if they are looking for justification for a return on interest rates, the increased uncertainty in the world market is enough to wait,” he says.
There has been no agreement on the decision of the Central Bank, which also gives rise to nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of the economists predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only around 30%.
This suggests a fall in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, if the decision-makers did not succeed in softening the shock by promising that the next draw will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 599.85.
The recovery was brought about by the expectation that the central bank will maintain its level this week, says John Lonski, Chief Financial Officer of Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It will be surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,” he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, “they have to make a lot of effort in their policy to support the financial markets so that they do not panic.”
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm down the financial markets as it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards slow tightening the monetary situation, which would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals are demanding more economic development in their election.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of recovery.
Although inflation is still below the central bank’s 2% annual target, the main reason for this is the temporary impact of lowered oil prices.
The economy will “survive and also need larger interest rates, taking into account the tight labour market situation,” says Ian Shepherdson, Chief Financial Officer at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell by up to 16 percent from its May record, when investors feared that China would slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now close to 10% below the peak in May.
For the central bank’s decision-makers, the turmoil in the market is an additional factor in a complex equation that explains why interest rates need to be raised.
Without these financial market events and recent weeks’ news about China’s economic weakness, policymakers would be tightening the level at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
The possible impact on the US economy is still quite unclear and they do not have much information at their disposal as regards the consequences of the events in China,” said Oliner.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous.
In 2013, then President Ben S. Bernanke's suggestion that the central bank could "decrease" the amount of money caused upheavals in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, said this month that “the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that appeared to be distinct from the fundamentals of the economy.”
The Federal Open Market Committee, which is making decisions, has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a member of the Committee with the right to vote, calls for example for 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings, “despite its limited, recognisable impact on US economic growth,” says Lacker.
A year later, these cuts were cancelled by the central bank.
The central bank should put economic stability first only during a major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The latest turbulence is nowhere near its level, Posen says.
No one wants to be in a situation where raising interest rates is feared because the market is getting upset,” says Posen, Chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a twofold requirement and does not mention financial stability. As long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazilian Pediatrics Association in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding women
The Brazilian Paediatric Association (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the necessary nutrients to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by around 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing the number of calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
Seven Channel Sunrise is a favourite in audiences, despite Nine Channel's efforts to report on the leader's revelation in Today's Show
The rush by Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report the aftermath of the Liberal Party's leadership disclosure failed to increase Today's number of viewers.
Nine channel morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull derailed Tony Abbott.
The rival program Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the week-long series of international broadcasts including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance between the ballasts did not seem to be detrimental to Australian TV viewers, as the average viewer in Sunrise was 397 000 in five state capitals, compared to 339 000 in Today.
Today's average rose slightly from Monday's (317 000) and last Tuesday's (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday's (343 000).
Today has been catching up with Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318 000 and Sunrise 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
So far, in September, the average for Sunrise is 349 000 spectators, compared to 314 000 for Today.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds are blowing this morning, not just in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news for the seven channel was the 800-word series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered an average of 1.219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson is the driving force behind the popular series without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night gave him real certainty.
Seven Channel The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1.136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
Seven had a dual fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz program hosted by Andrew O’Keefe attracted an average of 446 000 viewers.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 spectators - which was a small enough victory for Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat program (613 000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia had a first half-hour average of 520 000 viewers, with a second half-hour average of 720 000.
Hot Seat averaged 620 000.
The chase Australia's second-night average decline gives Nine the confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on McGuire's programme.

The final trio agree that Sam Wood is the perfect type - but who will he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah McCarthy and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who won The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret, with whom Sam Wood ends up together at The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls are not really slipping who got the last rose.
However, when talking to Sarah Mack, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could unwittingly give a hint of the winner’s identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women turned out to be poetic, telling them how Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humour, ambition, family value, and positivity as the reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, who should it go to?”, their answers could offer a revelation of who won the bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeanvons-Fellows and Markoski quickly referred to her as the best alternative to Wood after themselves.
Sarah McCarthy and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah's) energies and Sam's energies seemed quite compatible, and that idea was in my mind throughout the series," said Jeanvons-Fellows.
Sarah is really down-to-earth, it’s fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I have seen them together and there is chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah McCarthy believes that she and Sam Wood would fit in well as a couple.
Patrick said that last week's visits to his home made him realize that Wood could be "the right one".
When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now with my whole heart in this,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, she was enigmatic.
I don’t know if I can say,” he said.
I like the rest of the girls just as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 19.30 on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his move to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him since his open training day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first air kick in return for the team winning Minnesota Tuesday with a figure of 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight kick and took her into the running game after the injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula's true character was also reflected in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of barking at his new arrivals as a batter in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne in the post-game press conference.
49ers' special journalist Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the ball dropped and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the air kick that the Minnesota Vikings scored in the first quarter of the game
This was certainly not the start Hayne and her many Asian fans wanted for a man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on the way out of the field after the fall, and later told the Australian radio duo team Hamish & Andy on the 2DayFM channel at a frequency of 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his career in the NFL.
It was just one of these things now, you just have to think about the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared her groping to her 2007 Origin debut, when a feed in her own goal area led to a Queensland goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for her Instagram account in a photo published with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested with a gun, threatening the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 killed by police shooting rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal from police shot rubber bullets in a crowd protesting against the country's new draft constitution, the authority said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
The region's senior official, Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, said more than 1000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have been killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The confrontation took place in the last weeks of violent protests across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus group calls for its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
At the time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but the process was speeded up by the legislators after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted this week on the constitutional draft clauses in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said that the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
US National Hurricane Centre NHC says Cape Verde has a 60 percent chance of a cyclone in the south
The wide low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Island group, has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Centre of the United States reported on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front, located midway between the Cape Verde Island Group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, a weather forecast center in Miami added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) launched a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees entering Europe fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being informed by the director, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her personal experience.
Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations are made by four non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: the Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match every donation made worldwide on Google.com/refugeerelief to $5.5 million, with an overall target of $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the Syrian civil war that has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
It takes a long time to get the mortality data,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery specialist who wrote the editorial for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
For weight loss or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects in the study have been hospitalized obese, and their BMI has been 35 or more.
BMI, or weight-to-length ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the BMI is more than 30, they are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Taiwan-based Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric miniaturization, to the treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of those treated by means other than surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
Thirty-six per cent of the people who had had surgery had a complete and 28 per cent partial improvement in diabetes.
For comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partially by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgery group,” the authors said.
The researchers also monitored the blood hemoglobin A1c levels in patients, reflecting the long-term blood sugar levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
Postoperative hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this improved “glycemic control” described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over a five-year period, says Chief Research Scientist Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The study group also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
For the fifth year, when compared to a group that had undergone gastric surgery, the group that had undergone gastric bypass surgery had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased their body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased their hemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 and 2.1%), and was more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that while the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where surgery led to a longer life in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people undergoing weight loss surgery had a 29 percent lower probability of dying over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for those with less than 35 BMI who are interested in surgery.
The results of the study are crucial precisely because they show that surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group,” he says, without the increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their physicians should take weight very seriously when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
I think we wait too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that when a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it will be very difficult to reverse the situation.
Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in refugees’ home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the present situation the needs of all mankind should be put before the individual peoples, or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
Not everyone can come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their efforts in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime, we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The fundamental thing is to think about how we can reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the US's violent response resulted in a chain of violent events.
After the 9/11 attack, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in a letter and told him that a solution to this problem can be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the ingestion of a hand disinfectant in children has increased fourfold
Poisoning data centres across the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400 percent in alcohol-containing hand disinfectant ingestion in children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgian Poison Data Centre.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, the cases of disinfection in children under 12 years of age reported to poison control centres in Georgia rose from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
Children are more likely to be interested in these products, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are on call,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or respond to a challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap riser.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
The pleasant smells of disinfectant can attract younger children.
The child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand cides) are those with added fragrance.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant can contain anything between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few injections are needed for alcohol intoxication.
It’s really concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, director of the University of Kansas Hospital Poison Information Center, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So don’t leave the whisky shot lying on the table, but hand disinfectant is left out, and if children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four sprays of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school and was taken to first aid for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit for drunken driving in adults, says Chris Ritchey, a first-aid clinician who took care of the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
When she spoke, she slammed and was unable to walk when she arrived at first aid.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children’s hospital for possible brain injury, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head,” Ritchey said.
It was really frightening,” Nahijah’s mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
The situation could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and remove disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York, three fourth graders planned to poison their "bad" teachers by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from his class.
The police consider the plan to be a “untidy nonsense” and leave disciplinary action to the school district.

The lack of a Scottish championship is boring for the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax' current ambassador de Boer said: "The Netherlands is no longer showing the highlights of Celtic games and why?"
Because the Rangers are not involved.
People here are just not able to talk about the return of the Rangers.
They talk about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that is what they are interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and non-Scottish players also want to follow them.
Deila vows to turn things around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League quickly resulted in a loss to 10 men who played for Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the league with a five-point difference to the next.
However, Deila said, “Celtic has had bad episodes in the past, and we will rise again.”
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it is important to stay together.
Warburton on guard for January player transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on potential January player transfers, he is alert to the recruitment frenzy, convincing him that he does not want to confuse the team with a consensus.
Former Brentford boss said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the whole time before the season, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests retirement
Swansea attacker Michu, whose name is associated with Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
For two years, a 29-year-old player has had ankle problems and failed to find a new club outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later overturned, and this was already the third red card to be overturned in the last eight months.
Neilson stays behind his message, saying, “I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was reprimanded for admitting to singing an insulting song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before Derby at the Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
It was a derby and it was a whim of the moment,” the attacker said, adding: “It is safe to say I will not return to Tynecastle unless I then move on to play Celtic.”
Tannadice's government believes in the leadership of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly argues that the government of Dundee United still has faith in the leadership team’s ability to turn things around, but admits that the weakening of players must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We’ll get the boys back in shape,” Donnelly says.
McInnes delighted with the "ugly victory" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Acces, but managed, thanks to Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick, to achieve their seventh consecutive league victory, which raised them to the top of the table with five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, “There is no team that would have won anything, whether it be a trophy or a league that would not have also won games in this way.”
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the UK's overall growth
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164 000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK rose to 1.82 million people.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9 per cent higher than the UK's 5.5 per cent, according to the figures of the National Statistics Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over the three-month period, and the number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
Scotland's employment rate fell during the quarter to 74 per cent, which is higher than the UK average by 73.5%.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: “The government’s long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I witness execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, later today I will look at the man being executed.
If so, and I hope not, I will be sitting in the viewers' gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary Prison watching Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I am beginning to fear this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than free seats, participants are selected through a horrific draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media from twelve to five.
No matter who you choose, you’ll watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I come to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also made my own connection with him through calls made over the months, as well as a two and a half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I must not have a notebook and a pen with me to save what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner the way he wants, and you will be able to participate.
I chose the editor.
The wedding admitted that “could have laid out better” but still believes that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what to write and I won't do it even if he says so.
I have told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help to reverse the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post Reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to a series of podcasts I made.
I will not go through all the details again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would in any case make him guilty of aid.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he has not committed murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And so this is the point of view from which I consider him to have died.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists there who will take care of it.
For me, you get a description of what it feels like to watch a man I like die badly.
Man lured out of Canning River after watery police hunt
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry as he lured the man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to mislead the police went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres away from a policeman who tried to “slowly lure him back to the beach”.
Canning Vale police were summoned to Beckenham on Tuesday for unauthorised intrusion.
When they found the suspect, he tried to mislead them by heading to the Canning River.
However, he did not get very far.
He stood in the water saying ‘I’m not coming away, come and pick me up’,” said Senior Officer Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: a good police negotiation.
Sometimes people do funny things in an attempt to escape,” said Senior Officer Castledine.
Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspired locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims officials have tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that the officials of Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate their spies in his stables last year, and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He blames the officials and Racing Victoria's integrity division for claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to a treatment incident on the day of the race was the last staple.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition, and that he has faced a difficult situation after Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue under control for a year and a half about spy claims, and he did not want it to look like jealousy.
I didn’t mean to say anything about this, and I’ve been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that it all comes off at once,” Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with sanctions, and I have to live with what I have said.
I go home today and sleep well.
I want to go head on and I want the owners to think that I am doing my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I should no longer continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which he reported that the integrity department had tried to spy on his team.
A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I'll name him when asked - and offered him a job at my stables if he conveys information about what I do there.
They clearly see me as a fraud.
If that is the case, they should, of course, dismiss their lawyers, for they have failed to kill me.
Robert Roulston, former President of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a man, and perhaps to shift responsibility not only to coaches for what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I am saying may make them think just that.
But I am now at the point where I don’t care anymore, and it grieves me.
It really saddens me.
I urge them to make the decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has increased with the long-term study of Lidar's cobalt, and the late rejection led him to conclude that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for coaching the invincible champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of day care “laughing” after the mud or clay bath is put on the horse’s feet, which is wrong.
It is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on it.
It could have had a bath last night.
It could have had it yesterday, as it was.
It had it on the day of the race.
Moody may be faced with a three-month non-competition ban due to the day’s bath treatment, from which the officials started the study.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Driver arrested in Cobra
The police have arrested a man who ran into a cyclist during the weekend in Cobra.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after being seriously injured when a car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police reported that the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia came to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in the event of an accident, neglecting assistance and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, is still in hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL rugby league champions’ claims that his team’s tackles are part of the ‘line’.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to “wrestle” on his own side when he unexpectedly won the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely managed to cover up his reference to Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the finals. Bennett called the game the rugby league's "show window" and said two teams in Queensland were not "very excited" about the wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team’s tackles and said they were just focusing on “contact” when tackling.
Bellamy added that her confidence was boosted by two leading coach criticisms of Storm, as it means they are afraid of losing to the team.
This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or techniques throughout the year. In the last six weeks, we have only emphasized contact in the tackles, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he is probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett’s idea of an “exciting rugby” by reminding her mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons, coached by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing “boringly”.
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team that is able to play rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
This is the kind of game you want to play when you have those types of players.
He brought that up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby in his style - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I become more confident when they say things like this because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably did not think of us as an adversary to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more point-rich than the game between Broncos and the Cowboys.
Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it exciting rugby?
Or is it a violation of an exciting line of defence and a failure to score?
For me, this is about policy.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to play a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks at the premiere of Saturday night at AAMI Park.
$200 000 in guarantees for Serbian men for drug charges
A man who is threatened with a life sentence from an attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland is released for a $200 000 guarantee.
29-year-old Marko Maximovic is one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police tracked 100 kilos of the drug for the Solay yacht that came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in August in Coomera.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina throughout the morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in the Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovic is threatened with a life sentence from a business-intended cocaine holding company, his lawyer argued that there was no evidence that Maximovic was trying to hold the entire amount, and that he could be in the café for completely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
He has close links with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maximovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200 000 guarantee to ensure his release.
After reading the sworn certificates of both individuals, it is clear that setting a $200 000 guarantee amount is a real financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to prevent him from not appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on the condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports to the police on a daily basis and maintains his ban on outdoor activities between 6 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to the online communication service, where Hogg received numerous indecent pictures of the children sent to her by another user.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl looked at her phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five images, examined the computers on the scene, and found “distressing” online searches with keywords that had been used to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done this to "attract paedophiles" on the Internet before he "presented himself as a police officer to scare them".
Fiscal depute spokesman Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he is dependent on people being frightened.
He admitted that he had completed the searches on a computer, but said they had only been done because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman in order to scare the paedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him pictures and when Hogg asked him to send further pictures.
Hogg said he did this only for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking, he is sick and wants to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she shouted at her mother, shivered and wept.
The mother saw the indecent pictures on the phone and then faced the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she reported that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to making or taking images of indecent children on 14 June last year. He violated his guarantees on 25 January this year and failed to appear before the Court on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hoggia not be entered in the register of sex offenders, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a “significant sexual element”.
Mr Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence to October so that the social services had time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was given guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he was arrested before the hearing.
He was added to the register of sex offenders before the day of judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
Africa's oldest leader, Mugabe, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the speaker's podium.
He did not hurt, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening ceremony of Parliament was also tainted by opposition legislators' claims that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them against booing to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him with a cries while he was speaking to the House on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages from their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the title of the message is ‘death’,” Gonese told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
The message warned the members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they step out of office, the immunity would not apply.
The group discipline supervisor said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is “concerned” about the threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cutting efforts in the business services industry.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the fastest growing enterprise hardware and services.
Expected job cuts will bring about $2.7 billion in costs starting in the fourth quarter, according to HP's press release.
These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP President and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services to help companies move into new business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it will “focus on delivering unrivalled integrated technology solutions” for companies, according to the company’s press release.
The division breaks down the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, graduates from Stanford University, founded in the 1930s to manufacture electrical equipment. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, which is called “the birthplace of Silicon Valley”.
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates need to support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draws
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now, and assuming that his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he will not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire misses at least four of the next England games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in next summer's European Championship.
The biggest pity with this latest problem is that the end of Wilshere's last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
Such an injury is not a threat to a career,” Wenger said.
It is a bone that does not heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It is not related to his ankles or previous injuries he has had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, there is always a risk of further injuries when the player tries to return midway.
An uncomfortable model is also emerging.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since she made her debut six years ago.
In addition, in the last five seasons, he has played only 65 of Arsenal’s 157 league games.
Looking at Arsenal’s broader overall score after the 2007-08 season, in six of its eight seasons it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger acknowledges the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their improvement in last season’s disability statistics will continue.
Sometimes, when you recover from an injury, you may be vulnerable to a period when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will get a career that he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing on Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be on their way.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
I’m trying to maintain balance and give a pause to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up favourite of the F-block, the Maximum Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most daunting in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned from last season's Champions League surrender to Monaco, and is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand we can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in the series, especially considering that men’s need to open up is more desperate than ever, and young men’s suicide rates are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and is three times more common in men than in women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 Men's Year to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study included more than 2000 high school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. The study found that a person’s ability to recover doubled if a high enough percentage of his or her friends were “in a healthy mood”.
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the probability of potential mental health problems occurring was halved if they had healthy mental friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this time of communication through social media, the style goes beyond content and the immediate response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call externals: money, image, social status. All this takes place at the expense of internal values - personal growth and friendship - that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And, as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really does not get any greater happiness.
The greatness of the Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Not a single character defined their work, but rather their personality, which stood out clearly in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, although they often hesitate to fully explore their feelings.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me: “When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really understand how the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better.”
Men who contact us often feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of “getting over” is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to provide longer-term survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my unbiased, out-of-the-box position at the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And if you attend the FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a coffee?
Or, better yet, if you see someone lonely in Starbucks, smile and say hi.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria finishes and helps PSG beat Malmö to the side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored the Champions League in his debut, helping the PSG to bypass the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is a match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right track when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the Champions League goal in her debut in less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French league champions, but the team lost several chances before finally adding their lead when Cavan hit the goal in 61 minutes.
Paris, which is in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a sequel to the game, but also an improvement in their quarter-finals-leading games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the score, it was not a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot in front of the goal and was later changed from the pitch. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team in which he started a great career in 1999.
In the Champions League, it is not easy to win at home or away, so a 2-0 win will create problems for the opponent and look good in the statistics, and it is a good start, even if there are things we need to hone this season,” Blanc said.
This is foreshadowing the good.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we did not manage to score one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team with one of the three changes made after the team was left in a 2-2 draw against Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, an Argentine winger named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he testified why when he ran behind the Malmo defence line to catch Marco Verratt's feed, and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland at the back of the net.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win for PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a clogged opponent, winning the Celtic settlement match by reaching this level, with nine international players and a five-man defence in its opening field, and two players in the deep midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than a Nikola Djurdjic shot at the 34th minute, which passed a button on Kevin Trapp's goal post.
PSG, on the other hand, was sometimes in trouble due to lost inputs and poor finishes, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in a total of five attempts in the first half alone, and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in at the touch of Ibrahimovic at the very beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in his pre-work with his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's feed that Di Maria sent a spiral kick, which tilted around the Wiland goalpost at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally achieved after an hour of play, thanks to Uruguayan Cavan, who hit his sixth goal in the season, after Ibrahimovic had tapped on Maxwell's cross-feed from the left.
Malmo's hopes of getting back into the game ended, and only Wiland's brilliant fight against David Luiz's straight kick kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal of changing was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was one level higher than his team. The Norwegian said: “Our latest game in the Champions League was last December.”
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I put my hat on Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in stock sales
The mining industry in Switzerland left Glencore, which suffered from the collapse of commodity prices, raising on Wednesday $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of its extensive debt cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported in a notification that it had sold new shares for approximately £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities as China's economic slowdown strains demand and causes havoc in all markets.
The neo-marking raised the value of Glencore shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in the mornings of Wednesday.
Shares rose by 2.77 percent to 131.60 penny in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had revealed a $2.5 billion deal as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third the previous week.
The company sold a new share capital of 125 pence, which meant a 2.4% discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, totalling 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about the long-term stagnation in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while carbon, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a statement issued by the White House on Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington takes place on September 25th and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and President's spouse Michelle Obama will host a dinner for X and his spouse Peng Liyuan after bilateral negotiations have been held by the leaders.
The visit by President Xi will allow us to expand our cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to constructively discuss issues of disagreement,” the statement added.
On a visit that was first announced in February, Xin is also expected to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet a number of US technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington's concern about China's alleged online espionage and the country's increased absoluteness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon plays down the difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon met with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown to discuss the difference that, according to him, is not needed behind the scenes.
In a Sunday night episode of the HBO Project Greenlight, the actor interrupted Brown by stressing the need for different perspectives on the dark-skinned protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
When we talk about difference, it is taken into account when choosing actors for a film, not a series,” he said.
The shocked Brown reacted with disbelief, commenting "Oh, wow," while The Martian actor's comments remained hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series of finalists.
I want to encourage people to think, no matter who the director is, how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is a whore beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People called for the rights to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied rudely that their direction could “end up giving us something we don’t want”.
After the debate was broadcast, the social media exploded to disapprove of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip by writing: “Matt Damon talking over the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts.”
Since its publication, the tweet has collected over 5000 retweets and 4000 likes.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the exact racial representation in the media is in the foreground of social debate.
After white police killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement as the winner of the Grammy Award for the Album of the Year nominations.
Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently issued a statement in response to the Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, it was reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
On Monday, professional rock climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and receive a $1 million main prize.
There has never been a competitor in the competition programme that has just finished its seventh season, who would have survived all the sections of the obstacle course of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made their way to the final round.
In the final task, you had to climb about 23 metres of rope in 30 seconds.
Britten first climbed and explained the challenge on time, making him the first athlete ever to find out the exhausting 4th leg of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero explained the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a hard win and was still in shock about winning the $1 million main prize.
So it’s great to think about this when I’ve never earned or lived more than $10 000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big salary increase.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten won't get more commission money, even though he's the first competitor ever to get through the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
If more than one person passes, the money gets the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels resentment for that.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He is a great type and a good family.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If someone had to beat me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
The American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, which begins in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers creep past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season has not been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was once one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central division.
Tigers played his spoiler role perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
The Twins lost the chance to get to the other half of Houston Astros in a race for another slot on the American League wild card.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the second half of the season.
All wins are fun, no matter how they are made,” said Brad Ausmus, team leader at Tigers.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit ran three times in the first two innings, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in turn and released three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
I just want a strong end to this year,” Simon said.
It’s hard to feed a changer in every game, and that’s why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers replacement batter Victor Martinez hit three times and made it possible for two runs that were his first hit after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night after he hit the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
He waved the bat well,” Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting exercises), looked much better in batting exercises, and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the tide by hitting twice out on the left field line.
On the right hand side, Aaron Hicks came home with a click of one nest, and Simon was able to burn the second nest directly to the player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy was walking against Maurer, the only player to stand in front of the novice striker Miguel Sano, who pulled the two nests running left of the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the pitch and a leveling runner on the 2nd nest, VerHagen got a third runner, Trevor Plouffe, who hit the double ground.
This was the 27th time in this season when Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had secured the start of the ninth, Mauer pulled two beaten runs against the Tigers' closing Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned the Word in three passes in his fifth rescue.
At first, Detroit took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers received three runs in the first two tiers against a right-handed veteran player who got off the injured list before the game after being off for more than a month due to lower back inflammation.
It’s obvious that I didn’t want that kind of start,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I was doing a few nice feeds in the third round.”
After Hughes took the starter to the first nest, he allowed the second nest player, Ian Kinsler, to go one go.
On the right side, J.D. Martinez's walk in the event of two fires brought Victor Martinez to the batting turn, who took himself by midfield to the first nest and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 pipe while the runners were in good running positions.
Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing the second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned in his attempt to advance to the third base.
Tigers continued in the second inning and received one fire, two nests in the situation, a run from James McCann, and two fires, one nest in the situation, a run from Center Anthony Gose, after which the situation was 3-0.
It was an important shot,” said Paul Molitor, team leader at Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be in the feed and fed a non-running third inertia, after which he was replaced by the right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes was given three runs out of six beats and a four-fire walk.
NOTES: Tigers right-handed pitcher, Anibal Sanchez, was thrown away due to a shoulder strain.
He was examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder stretch, but had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start off against Twins.
Norris statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after the left-handed pitcher David Price was traded to him on July 30.
Norris has been outdoors since 20 August due to the stretching of the right crooked abdominal muscle.
The three-game series of Tigers and Twins ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is standing against Minnesota's right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
The economy must open up more to the outside world in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, whose task is to steer reform.
China should commit itself to attracting foreign finance and expertise and developing a policy of openness," he said at the 16th meeting of the lead group on deepening the overall reform.
Supporting transparency while driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality, and will create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, a loosening of border control principles, an invitation to state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created that will identify the sectors and companies to which no investment is allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant, as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to run their business.
The opinion also said that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation as well as new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up government-controlled sectors to private financiers, more sectors are opening up.
The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, the application process for foreign permanent resident permits, “green cards”, is facilitated by optimising the requirements and lightening the application process.
The meeting also discussed the safeguarding of the rights of lawyers to practise and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in a statement published after the meeting.
