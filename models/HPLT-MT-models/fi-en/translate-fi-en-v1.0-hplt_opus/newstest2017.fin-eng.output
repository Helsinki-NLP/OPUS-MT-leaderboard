28-year-old chef found dead at a shopping mall in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre this week.
The victim's brother says, however, that he does not know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, "His affairs were finally going well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Medical Office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was considered a homicide and that the investigation was ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line chef in Boston, had had his dream job as a line chef at the San Francisco-based restaurant Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were “horrified and shocked” because of his death.
We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be badly missed,” the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying in hostels at the beginning, but that his affairs were “finally going well”.
He found an apartment and dated a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he knew no one who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a big heart.
His way of feeling cohesive with the family was to make us food, to make dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who was drifting with the stream.
In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an unscrambled diamond that shined brighter every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information on the matter is invited to call the San Francisco Police hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical Practitioners on strike: Demands for new industrial action
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade union to accept new industrial action in their dispute over the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) calls on the entire Council to support new industrial action from the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
Medical trainees and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement agreed with the BMA.
58% of the electorate rejected it.
In a letter to members published via Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained “insistently quiet” on issues that, according to her, led to the rejection of the agreement.
In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the completely proposed new agreement and to call for formal renegotiations of all your concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to mandate an early September progressive and expanding industrial action programme.
The controversy has resulted in medical trainees taking part in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS healthcare system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the director of BMA's medical interns, resigned after the vote had been rejected on the terms recommended by the BMA.
He had told the members of the BMA at meetings before the vote of 54 000 medical trainees and students that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would be handed over to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands and declare the battle of eight months of words and economic sanctions officially over.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
Yes, the event was shaken.
But Putin's smile seemed violent, and he did not breathe much heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, was constantly talking about his "Dear friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I messed up in the bills.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels, but even to better ones.
The next day, the newspapers here described the behaviour of Erdogan as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the radiant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in his back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to rebuild true trust.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led an astounding, in-depth attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious accusations were made by high officials that the Erdogan family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received his apology from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of agreeing a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdoğan needs all possible friends after he was almost out of power in last month's failed coup.
The constant terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
In addition, there is an economic motive.
Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90 per cent.
For Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved as flights eventually continue.
They are hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as formulated in the Vedemosti newspaper's report.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding a long-standing grudge to the snail’s pace of advanced EU membership negotiations, Putin is keen to take advantage of the coolness and erode Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly received loose points from Ankara, where he called after a revolution attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is the case with Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the brazen seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce an “external alliance” as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel that the West has abandoned them and mistreated them, joining forces.
However, the two have major disagreements despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
It can be a lot to say that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question about their disagreements, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear understanding of where they can seek a common ground for Syria.
After months of open hostilities, and given the possibility of a full-blown NATO member as Turkey shoots down a Russian fighter plane, it is certainly better that the two leaders are again on speaking terms.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s international goals.
Since the bank collapsed almost eight years ago and had to be saved, it has given up on these goals.
At the moment, the Bank’s strategies have used the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but will not be restarted from the beginning.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, with the exception of the main office and stock exchange listings, are converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by Irish and Northern Ireland customers.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and our employees, because we will now become much more of a brand bank.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
It’s time for us to move in the direction of the brand bank, because basically (we’ve asked) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focused on our customers’ needs, not ours, I think you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins Newmarket with Prediction and wins 3000
Dettori sprays champagne after he has a total of 3000 wins after a double win
Racing rider Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved a milestone in his second victory on his home circuit as he competed with John Gosden's Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in a race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: “This is special.”
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20 000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The Dettor absorbs cheers as he leads the Prediction out after the victory.
Two riders have reached this milestone in the obstacle race - master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had record-breaking careers with over 4300 victories.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best riders of the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical crank distinguishes him from others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his passion and charisma have been pulling fans into the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have ridden 6000 winners if he were not just a weekend and big race jockey!
Franky has been riding the winners for most of the 30 years in the UK, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is good for British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a milestone in his branded flying landing from the saddle.
From flying endings to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
A heap of victories in major competitions, including his famous ‘Magnificent Seven’ victory at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft accident and suffered a non-competition due to drugs.
Three years ago, he had difficulty at first returning after six months of non-competition, but he showed considerable character strength when challenging the suspects and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin separates Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Environmental and Transport Specialist.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin had ordered Ivanov to move away from the post of head of the Russian presidential administration, but no reason was given for this.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in 2012 at the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) in Tallinn, Estonia, and served at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he led the president's protocol and government staff, said the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State when it comes to drafting laws and managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that Persecution be appointed in his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet security service KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a state television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once promoted as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real suspicion.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in the early 2012 I asked you to give my four-year responsibilities this very complex, if only to say laborious, task.
Well, now I have been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov accepted the assignment in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service (KGB), as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia Putin after the second term, for Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson gets a shoe after hitting the producer
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at the filming site of the series in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the scene.
I regret that it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how to remove the character of Gibson from a series of FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the drama & Greg sitcom, has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
I love the Criminal Minds series, and I’ve given it all for the last 12 years,” said Gibson in a Friday statement.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the series can have.
The start of the twelfth season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
Mysteries ended up in the garden in Banff
A man living in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a whirlwind.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material about the revelation in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now stretches to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
The engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossing and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four locks between the “cover fans” that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It has 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 wire ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the overpass of Queensferry.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, where more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge section alone.”
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precise dimensions must match.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the last section of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lockout represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
After the last section of the road cover was installed and combined with the expanding north pole road cover, we then had to close the remaining section from the north, that is, from the inland side.
This was done by pulling the northern fairway ground bridge 700 mm southwards.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the land is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of about 3%.
Demanding, because the allowed dimensional deviations, according to which the team worked, were tiny, only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Salvation at Moelfre Bay: Three men are “lucky while alive”
The three men are “lucky while alive” after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station alerted at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing in the Moelfre Bay.
Three men tried to swim safely as their boat continued on its own.
We saw the boat going closer to the men and we thought the worst,” said Vince Jones, the helmsman of the Moelfre lifeboat.
Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving,” he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
The men were taken to the coast rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “The three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill switch rope, but it had somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these friends today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go gets people to get up from the couch and take part in some activity.
The screen time was initially limited to television, then to video games, and now recently to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude each other.
I refer, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed for video games in the 1990s (later they became a series of drawings, playing cards and other follow-up products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat dilute before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
How does it work?
In a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon, which are tracked by GPS, and which can be “photographed” (by phone screen capture) or “catched” after discovery.
A generation that played the game when it was younger has joined the craze and jumped up from the couch to join the quests.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the “average person”’s daily steps.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which follows 35 000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% for users followed by Cardiogram.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the training level data.
Many public health campaigns have called for ‘find 30’, ‘get up on the couch’ and ‘be active every day’ to have made no difference because the majority of public health warnings are boring and caring for people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity cannot be underestimated.
People who move regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, resentful spoilers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There has been a breakthrough.
Although earlier there were applications like Fitbit that could track activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The charm of the novelty disappears and the use of it will fade in due course.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people who are hunting to be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the public outcry.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Energetic jumps.
Smooth with a boom.
Incredibly on a permafrost.
Great everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached a multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than that of the silver medalist and teammate “Final Five” Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The party became the fourth American woman to successively win the multi-game championship, and overall the fifth American champion, while strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement brings him into the same category as other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
For the last three years, Biles has dominated his sport, winning 15 World Cup medals, including 10 gold, with programmes whose mix of ambition and precision has been so astounding that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I can see".
The final test was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the other competitors, but between him and the over-expectation burden.
Returning to the family home in Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles, left of the United States, and Aly Raisman, after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) for women's gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, when he served as the culmination at the start party of the retiring national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he goes his long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanence programme, which includes his trademark volt-pass, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be great for the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted as a toddler by her grandparents, and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a force.
He has not lost in a multi-match since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balancing boom and the permantus, where Biles is the dominant world champion, were waiting.
He rose to the top of the boom with 15.433 points and crossed them by getting 15.933 permanence.
Raisman hugged him kindly as they waited for the final points - a mere formality - and tears rose in the eyes of Biles in glitter red, white and blue when the dream he once wrote about in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a reversion from four years ago, when he was in third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina during the rerun.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call “grandmother”, was clearly in charge.
He sent flight kisses to the public after his permanated performance in emotional turmoil about a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old’s widespread tweet this past week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims were shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in the deadliest attack of the first serial killer in Phoenix in the last decade, were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police statement published on Thursday.
The authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on June 12.
The bulletin says that a gunman standing on the passenger side of the car launched a handgun up to eight times and then escaped with another vehicle.
According to the police, the third death did not seem to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take handbags or another adult victim for $2900.
A Phoenix police representative, Chief Inspector Jonathan Howard, said the shooting allowed the investigators to examine whether it was linked to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks over a four-month period, which have been carried out in two predominantly Latin American regions.
These are happening in the residential area in front of the home,” Howard said earlier this month to CBS’s subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used a number of vehicles, including the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers have not agreed to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are interrelated and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also issued a police bulletin on the shooting, which took place just half an hour before the triples were killed, targeting an empty open van, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The researchers found bullet sockets, a bullet in the seat, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: “The situation will be made easier”
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is a small-headed man. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I could not do this.
I can't do this.
I did not promise this.
What is not true at all, of course, I promised,” he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
My first reaction was that I didn’t know people were still doing it,” Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still does not speak.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
She also loves to play with her two brothers and to sing.
Elizabeth shows me how the signs that Edmund invented are signposted "Sing me a song."
We teach him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language - he says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different causes: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load of an uncertain future.
I just asked what was going to happen.
What will happen?
He still does not really know.
In fact, I have not asked for a forecast for a long time, because I do not expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
The situation will be made easier.
You can believe that the situation will be easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, with more rain expected for the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks and posed a widespread threat of flooding due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities, and that help is already coming to the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, the Governor's Security and Emergency Preparedness Office, said they would receive requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that tens of thousands of sandbags were requested by the Tangipahoa County alone.
The flood guard is valid until Saturday in a large part of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that three to five cents more rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood guard was in effect on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouge and the River Amite near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a flood record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a threat of flooding down the river in Ascension County as the flooded rivers slowly fall into Lake Maurepas.
To the south of the Mississippi State border, the Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at its highest ever level on Friday morning at nine o'clock.
Rescuers still pick people from floodwater in Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and son-in-law were close to Gloster on Friday.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that the water in Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that the other, near-by stepson, warned him.
We woke up, and the water just kept rising,” Hansford said.
It extended all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she had not seen the water in the brook so high during the 48 years she had lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have injuries, and that he is the only one with swimming skills.
Hansford said the rescuers rescued the trio in a large army-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station where the rescuers stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods “spread rapidly” as heavy rains continue, and that evacuation orders are being prepared by the authorities.
Krautmann says that one eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated with heavy rain since Wednesday.
The heavy rain and the flooding of the streets led to the rescue of the residents of Tangipahoa County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipaho, a member of the city council said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under flooding.
The county president, Robby Miller, said the authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets that had been overcrowded.
Protects have been opened for those who have been evacuated to the cities of Amite and Hammond.
They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water starts to fall,” he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, about twenty streets were closed due to rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
The last major flood here was in March,” said the city’s administrative authority, Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, the emergency leader of Harrison County, Rupert Lacy, said that the steady rain continued along the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded, but so far no flood incidents have been reported on Friday.
The head of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amite, Keith Townson, has been living in the area for 40 years.
I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen before,” Townson said, “and the rain continues.
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives the Philadelphia shooting
Police report that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, which means a second six-year-old was shot in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown had several gunshot wounds on his groin, leg, hand and stomach, among others, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
He suffered a lot, his small body was full of bullets," the son's grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the condition of the boy is recorded as critical, and several surgeries have been performed on him.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the status reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems there was a cross between several shooters.
The attack weapon type shells, which originated from various attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a constant struggle.
There were sockets on both sides of the pavement on the street.
It therefore seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in an active fight,” said Anthony Ginaldi, Philadelphia Police Chief.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and, according to the information received, the police are investigating the recordings of the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old girl was hit by a stray bullet in her hand on Tuesday as she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighbourhood.
He is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s how I call this year’s women’s gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Olympic Games since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and the second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised as an Olympic winner, and America was cheering.
Now the world has witnessed the amazing performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they perform unexpected but mastery gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to successively win individual gold in a women's multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation does not look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are “Final Five” (the last five), because there will be only four gymnasts in the next Olympics, and this is Marta Karoly’s last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts mostly practice in private gymnastic clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as families) and the list goes on.
Much of these gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighbourhoods that can support the sport.
In these clubs gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities where there are many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15 000 urban youth (mainly black and Latino) and we have trained national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mind diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team’s inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious “girl power” by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young women.
Doctors organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved deal with British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37 000 interns who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that the NHS was on ‘unknown soil’, and that even minor additional delays would harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new agreement, which will include changes in nighttime and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Committee of Medical Practitioners of the BMA, said last night: “Medical Practitioners still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it will accelerate the existing labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally.”
When the time before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract is only eight weeks, progress must be made and the time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have met with reluctance on the part of the government to participate and, from time to time, deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, I saw that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the sanctions and take into account the concerns of the medical trainees.
If he does not, then the medical trainees are ready to continue their industrial action.
The most recent strike at the end of April meant a postponement of nearly 13 000 routine surgeries and 100 000 appointments, when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to serve as substitutes for doctors in the strike guard.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials.
BMA wants better weekend pay for 54 000 medical trainees covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, Managing Director of NHS Employers, called on medical trainees not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, carers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of Guardian Role and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional education for returnees, education costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education England Training Association and the Ministry of Health are in November, February and May for compliance with the agreements reached with the BMA.
A £2 daily medicine can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a £2 daily medication after the authorities recommended that it be given to people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
The NHS supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140 000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them get a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat build-up in the artery wall, which forms stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot falls off, it can go with the blood and cut off the blood supply to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, lowers this risk by making coagulation less likely.
It is recommended that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective preventative treatments, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating.”
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to add available treatment options to many thousands of people who may benefit from them.
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially with regard to the risk of bleeding - over a period of more than three years are limited, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
Culture of political correctness allows election fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving a boost to the government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the widespread disregard of voting fraud in Muslim communities, revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles scolded the police, election officials, and city councils for ignoring evidence of election fraud due to “race and religion-related hypersensitivity”.
The former Community Secretary, the current anti-corruption emperor, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to put security chains outside the polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the electorate only has to say its name and address.
The report even proposes that the voting person’s finger be indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for wider access for the press to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud,” he said.
The government commissioned the report as a result of the voting scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous corruption and illegal prosecutions.
The court found that Rahman “cynically misrepresented” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of a person voting for someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the election fraud in the postal vote, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made a number of recommendations on the cleaning up of the voting system, including proof of identity with an identity card
In his report, he says: “The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
Concerns were raised that...the state institutions had ignored such conduct because of the hypersensitivity to the ‘politically correct’ race and religion.
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists being allowed to process ballots received by post in order to end the “collection of votes”.
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for more stringent checks on registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Look at the options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of a person who votes in indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent political activists from handling completed mail-borne sounds and envelopes in which sounds are sent.
Let the police set guard chains around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to blame people for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Confirm the training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the voter should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is running the Greater London Police Force, saying that it is “amazing” that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets incident.
The Electoral Court was left behind by Lutfur Rahman and his officials for a number of corruption and illegal acts,” he said.
On the basis of a number of grounds, he was found guilty without any doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticized ineffective “tick-box checks” at city council polling agencies.
Sir Eric said: “The Tower Hamlets judgment last year was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a brilliant legacy as a Parliamentary birther, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threaten this good reputation.”
Mad about Kate's bicyclist and other celeb pictures at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Games have gone crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of his own famous double - at least according to social media.
So, in honour of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the US men's archery team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's twin on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the US men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his pictures surfaced, where he appears to be scaring like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, becoming aware of the social media zeal, the archer admitted that he has heard since childhood that he looks like Leo.
I personally do not see a great resemblance, except perhaps for the beard,” Brady told Huffington Post.
He’s a good-looking person, so I guess this is a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: a startling resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, has been said to be the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has for years been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks that Nathan is the “sporty version” of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both with similar strong eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the tanned skin and pale hair of actress Analynne McCord, while the American team, Nathan Adrian, reminds fans of the "sports version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, share the same facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presenting the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between the two
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that “others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the American football star and the actor at Dexter really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide smile matches Bring It On star Gabriel's smile to the Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for saying Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Instead of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan, Byron MacDonald's analysis of the women's 4x200-metre freestyle message angered CBC's viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC must have apologised after one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer had "lost like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig".
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the 4x200 meter women's freestyle message final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's commentator team to bring "color," was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China shuddered, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.”
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79 to 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘died like a pig’????
The idiot didn’t realize he was still on the live stream.”
China's Ai Yanhan was filmed in the women's 4 x 200 m relay final as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China slammed, baby."
A review of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was tough and quick, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how careless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group. #disgusting.”
Shortly afterward, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologised to MacDonald on the live broadcast, saying: “We regret that the comment on the bathing performance was sent.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened.”
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times for people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Colleague Scott Russell had to apologise for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologised and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and were sent live.
Last night we took quick action and apologized to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised in a live broadcast and tried to define his remarks by stating that he did not intend to interpret it as a personal attack.
I would like to apologise at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said in the CBC Olympic broadcast.
I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not him as a person.
Needless to say, I did not mean it to be disrespectful, and I am really sorry.
Primark's client was shocked by a woman who boldly fitted her underwear in the middle of a shop
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of the Primark movement to try underpants.
Things were not improved by the fact that after assessing what she looked like in her trousers, the woman peeled them off and placed them back on the shelf.
He went on a tour and eventually matched four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman fitted underpants and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, said that after experimenting with underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and walked away from the store without buying anything".
He said, “People didn’t believe their eyes.”
She stood in the middle of the shop floor, took a pair of presented underpants, undressed her own pantyhose and underwear, and put the fit on her legs.
He did not even try to find a remote place in the atonement, he just stood there shamelessly.
Everyone stared, while he undressed his underpants and obviously did not like them, because he put them back on the shelf.
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding he didn't like anything he saw, dressed again, and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care who was watching – or thinking of a person who would end up buying the underpants he fitted.”
David, a 33-year-old living in Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone takes home underpants that someone else has tried, but hasn’t been cleaned.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is all right.”
It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they have not been washed.
A representative of Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in the movement of Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
How to defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Krav Maga Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrach, who lives in New York City, to find out how to deal with gun-sweaking robbers in close proximity.
Whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video shows you how to pay the attacker with the same measure.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, you must first turn to see your attacker and “clear the line of fire”.
You then grab a gun between the forearm and the shoulder before hitting the attacker with your free elbow.
Continue to strike the knee into the groin, and when the attacker goes from pain to a barrel, wring the gun out of his hands, hit him at the back of the gun in the face, and retreat while keeping the gun directed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to launch.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun from his grip, retreat and point at him with a gun.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing this.
But remember that if you are not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery is to give up your money.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveller has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflex by licking some of Europe’s dirtiest and most repulsive places.
Suffolk-born host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked the railing, railing in the Piccadilly Circus, the flushing button on the train toilet, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each item, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to face.
However, the experiment, which was made after a film called The Inner Power, yielded surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem completely uneasy, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the sink in the kitchen.
On his journey across Europe, Wright constantly talked to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him with any other bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well-known test of his gut resistance when he traveled the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, extending from the rails of public railway stations to the flush button of the toilet seat, really tested his immune system.
In the film, he said: “Since I was a child, I have been fairly carefree about my health, and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth since dirt, worms and curly water.”
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had more than 4000 units read in the photometer.
For comparison, the reading of freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the result of the photometer showed more than 4000 units, and the result of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist film, The Inner Power, along with the Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said, “This is almost the worst thing I have smelled in the toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything, because there's something out there.
On the trail of internal power was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which help to improve the efficiency of people’s gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Director of Valio’s snacks, juice and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of ‘let’s call Ian’.”
They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary film we can interestingly tell more about it to consumers.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, the director of the documentary, added: “Let’s say this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him, such as the staggering Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Understandably, some of the things that were licked were easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I’m glad we managed to save some of those dirty licks.”
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents specifically linked lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they at least occasionally use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The bully family destroyed a rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, before eviction
The bully family caused £50 000 in damage to their rental house after they were evicted for terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints.
When they had been forcefully removed from the property, the staff of the housing company were shocked to find the property in poor condition.
Gaping holes had been made in the walls, floor boards had been torn, waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been wasted with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don’t think people should have to live like this.
Here are a lot of things to consider, as this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious.”
The couple had three boys who lived in the property, and according to the police, the family’s tyranny included street fighting on baseball bats, intimidation of close residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, quarreling, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was leased, received a decision on antisocial behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under threat of demolition had old waste.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs were previously transmitted, were pulled up.
The neighbours said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing evicted a woman and her partner from the property by force this week, giving them an extended period of time, 11 weeks, to change voluntarily.
The relieved neighbours thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become one hell of a thing.
One said, “They didn’t care about anyone.”
We lived with them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We have seen the police here incredibly many times.
This morning we could not sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of Cornwall Housing neighbourhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down to the feral wall of the rental house.
He added: “It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own and his family’s behaviour, for eviction is always the last policy considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme, and their actions certainly horrified the neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the courageous, informed community members.
I hope this development brings some comfort to our neighbours and sends a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
After an eviction, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
Workers in the housing company must now clean the piles of waste surrounding the house
In 2014, the police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis and scales, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined for acknowledging that he was guilty of possession of a class B drug with the intention of distributing it.
He claimed that the money was intended for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partners live homeless after staying in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
For many of the walls of the house, graffiti had been scoured.
The police say they are trying to evict residents who are mocking the rules of their rental.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
This is a message for those who think their behaviour is without consequences, and for those who suffer from such behaviour,” he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew down the beach at a low altitude
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal have experienced the shock of their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane swept past really low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Right now, the horrified tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came close to touch with the sun worshippers on the sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not initially see what was coming towards them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, last afternoon.
One of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of a dramatic pass-by on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It passed twice at a very low altitude, and at one point it seemed as if it was about to crash.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and it really felt like the plane was falling on me.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown much lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force assured that no one's safety was at risk.
The fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, and four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly due to low visibility conditions, smoke from wildfires and thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
Excluding the first half of the year results better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) made a better result than planned in January - June of 3.4 million euros.
Exote's result was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has enabled the dismantling of institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Exote aims to shorten the action queues.
Exote covers the deficit that was previously created with the surplus.
The excess of it may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Government of Exote will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Jaegers Swear Military Oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military cetaceans of the Border and Coast Guard School were held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Jaeger Course was held in the garrison's sports field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special Border Jagers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border jager.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special Border Jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the war-time frontier forces were present at the veteran meeting in connection with the cetacean.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
A few minutes ahead of the bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has had an RTA, i.e. a crime intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible to the outside.
The Häme Police Department has a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is run by a superintendent located in Lahti.
The Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Directors in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian person dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian fashion.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the other police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would less and less often leave the straws in the mires only when they receive an alert.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, day-to-day police operations are targeted where they are most needed.
Along with the reform of the police administration, a crime intelligence centre, its three national units and its own crime intelligence unit were established in the country.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, leads the operations nationally.
PTR units, as their name suggests, work with the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in shared areas according to the police departments, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Enquiry extends beyond your own territory
While the individual police is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department.
The inquiry also extends beyond the boundaries of your own institution, because this is what crime does.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, an alert function database and observations to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of working.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
On the basis of the method of action, a certain image is formed of the author.
Serialization can be done either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which of the police has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not move up the collars in the city, but their work is not entirely public either.
The methods used by both individuals and criminals are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus preventing crime prevention attempts by the police.
The police will publicly report on the methods if they are anticipated to pose a threat.
For example, in the early summer, such a case was reported as a way of marking empty dwellings used in apartment break-ins.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the outer door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really travelling.
The pre-trial material is public at least to the parties.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest ones order the minutes of the district court, which can show, for example, that fingerprints have been found in the place.
The next time the thieves go hand in hand with gloves.
For the case, Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police, Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finnish Police, Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station, and Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collects and analyses information that is used to plan practical activities.
Against the background of a decrease in labour and financial numbers.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage ORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation collects information from outside the own institution and Finland’s borders.
Isis-related student killed in Syria from London
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join the Isis, is reportedly dead in Syria.
The lawyer Tasname Akunjee said that the girl's family heard that she died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the foundation of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a gravestone and a testament to others, that there are real risks associated with going to a war zone - that it could get people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London students flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The family of Sultana was told that the girl had married an Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow only after a few months.
Reid says Clinton considers Garland to be a candidate for the Supreme Court if she is elected
Secretary of the Senate Harry Reid says he is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected as president.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, says that the next president will elect a late Supreme Court member to replace Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday, in a teleconference, Reid said he predicted with some certainty that Clinton would choose Garland.
A representative of Reid later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would name Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the head judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the "goals" and "facilitators" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says that the naked calendar is “for women as well as for men”
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they are going to find the next top model generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of naked pictures is different from the old school Playboy because “Playboy is for men”.
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks that the calendar is for them too.
We must begin to reintroduce the timeless and classic nudity in which women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the naked female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of vinyl: who actually buys the records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before rushing to fill in the comment section with irritable insults, which are written by the nickname NotAllSolitaryMiddle-agedMen, note that this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed re-entry is not because more and more people born in this millennium are inspired by the novelty of physical objects, but by the longing for middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, most of all, the most unlikely age group to buy records is 18-24 years old.
It’s not just about collecting hobbyists, it’s about emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are a bit more likely to have their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But is YouGov’s results correct?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would sign up very vividly before I stop, I would make a cup of my hands and say something authoritative like, “Let’s look at it in more detail.”
Let's look at it in more detail.
While Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and office stores now fill the buildings that used to have independent stores - a handful of great specialized record stores are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment as I stand very close to a variety of men in some of these shops trying to assess their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, who I follow from Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and travels around shops to spend a few hours.
I ask if he is a collector.
I guess I am,” he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 discs.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent a sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and cashless.
Much of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, discs that were released when there were 11 or 12, discs that I was probably a little too young to buy,” he says.
He agrees that buyers of records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my vice.”
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit into YouGov’s profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the enthusiasm of the media, people who have heard that the plates have come back into fashion and who have had a need to buy back their old plates.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back,” he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of vinyl wake-up calls of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the plates?
It takes a few seconds for a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the persistence of familiar album covers; items that evoke memories of teenage days.
I think it can sometimes be about filling a gap or some kind of consolation that the possession of objects creates,” Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
We’re like their social workers!” another employee suddenly said from a stack of records.
The April ICM poll revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable they would never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyls do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably seem seriously worried about browsing the stack of bossa nova collections.
This “prize” aspect of the revival is something Jonny, 42, has also noticed working in the Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men).
Someone came in a while ago and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead album so we can put it on the shelf’, he says.
This is not a big deal, but it definitely is.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a record player.”
Not parents, but younger people, late teenagers who are just getting excited about it.
Foppi, where almost a whole floor is reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
70-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned shops - from speakers to fresh Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-filled pop, and not improvisation jazz - it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to prove a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes watching various discs on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says that he doesn’t earn much, so recording isn’t really an option.
It’s expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on your computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” he sighs in love.
I don't know how to explain - it's truly unique.
My last stop is said to have attracted a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While trying to look at my jeans shorts, I observe a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before their father and daughter contemplate buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left, there is a staircase with a wall covered with the plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely ‘art vinyls’.
But given that even a small amount of attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho for more, there is not much to complain about here.
It comes as no surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They don’t really spend their Thursday mornings delving around Berwick Street’s record stores browsing through records and avoiding the look of a creepy, 30-year-old television presenter as he peers over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest live vertebrate animal - video report
The researchers say that the holker has a longer life span than any other vertebral column on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is for a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old, which is five metres long.
French court rejects application to unload trades from Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected an application by the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops, where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pennies), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect’s office argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a tax-exempt parallel economy and because they pose a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a government-backed organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The Court of Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evictioning 72 people who ran the temporary trade, but said that the prefect’s concern “was perfectly understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants played a much greater role than feeding people who lived in “extremely uncertain conditions”.
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids’ Cafe in the camp, which operates on a non-profit basis and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, as well as asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lone minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter sent to the Guardian said that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
On Friday, two charities, Help Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, estimated that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - peak readings - since the sharp rise in the number of arrivals during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall significantly faster than the EU average
In Finland, food prices fall sharply to the delight of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price in EU countries has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen most in those EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
Only in the UK, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is presented in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager at Statistics Finland, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then there was a turn, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now set by Russia’s bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the producer prices of agricultural products have decreased.
Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as an impressive advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not a low-cost food destination, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland with a wage level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the comparator countries had the same VAT percentage, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland with the same level of wages.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven per cent in the comparison countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finnish ones.
If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average of the EU countries and the price competition must continue,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations with VAT percentage are indicative.
School is no longer exactly the same
Those returning to school may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline according to which all Finnish schools operate.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan outlines the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
For example, the teaching of fiction will be abandoned, and instead the schools will start to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies start at the fourth.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of the students.
It used to be thought that the teacher teaches students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate shark found - an ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even the known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It can then live for another 250 years, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebral column in the world today.
In the animal world, it is only passed by a clam whose oldest known individual is dated to 507 years of age.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to follow-up only about one centimetre a year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females trapped in fishermen's gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon timing of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters of amazon, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that the ice shark females reach sexual maturity only more than four metres long, the researchers calculated that they are at that point at about 150 years of age.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann to fire nearly 300 - sellers are not reduced
Almost 300 employees are laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
The cooperation companies in the company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant," says Stockmann in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers of department stores will not be reduced in order to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, about 80 employees of the support services will be offered new jobs as a seller.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3 000 employees.
At the time of their start, it was estimated that there would be around 380 employees.
The aim of the reduction is to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which will be implemented in the coming year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
This is due to Stockmann’s difficulties in making the department store trade profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the department store still makes a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, the Acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen says in the press release.
The second quarter profit improvement was due in particular to the good success of the Lindex clothing chain.
The chain achieved the best second quarter turnover and results ever.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the operating result of the entire Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist at HS.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but there will be a lot of rain in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20°C throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees will remain.
Kenyan athletics team shakes doping scandal - strange explanation for coach's rapture
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah performed as a team athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform was the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample as a Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials visited the Anzrah authorities.
Anzrah was sent home because he "had committed a crime against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept this kind of behaviour," the chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, Kip Kei, said, roaring the news agency Reuters.
Athletics at the Olympics will start on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year on the way and is ahead of Rio's top picks.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah traveled with an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being revealed," the source said.
Where is everyone?
Rio athletics stadium rubberizes its emptiness
Where is everyone?
Not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to watch athletics.
On Friday in Rio, the battle for athletics medals began, but the world's top performers were able to show off their skills to an empty audience.
On Friday, Rio announced that only 58% of the first-day morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets had been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium swelled with cheery people.
The finals tickets are sold out in Rio too.
The demise of the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the spectators of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70% full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, with only about 30 percent of the grandstand for 12 000 people.
Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not able to complete the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, spokesperson for the event organisers, said that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though they cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
Volunteers and military personnel at the London Olympics were allowed to sit in empty spaces, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, as organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren for lesser-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places at Rio Stadium in the morning.
Not even beach volleyball on the sand of Copacaba has interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were plenty of people in the galleries.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
The foundation, founded last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, corporate and entities can redeem the ownership rights to land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is divided into virtual blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to have a right of ownership for a fee.
The holder is entitled to veto its 187 square metre block, which means that approval is not required for each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
Acquiring a right of possession is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Leviakangas, who acquired the right of possession for his company.
The acquirer of the right of administration receives precise location information from the block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of the persons acquiring the right holders are shown on the same map where the block data of the land area can be found.
Leviakangas sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the foundation’s operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation will act in some way unbiased or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltaja project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of holder rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves are the worst in big cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves are the worst hit by large cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in the other nine major cities.
Based on the bicycle theft reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat explained how many bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen per thousand inhabitants in the ten largest cities in January-August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti reached the top.
According to police reports, four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants took place.
In Espoo and Kouvola, the police reported only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
That's the big difference.
In other cities, there are twice the number of thefts relative to the number of inhabitants," says Police Inspector Tommi Reen.
The police in Turku are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
The prevalence of theft can be affected by how much people move around the city on wheels and how many wheels there are at all,” says Teemu Äikäs, Senior Adviser at the University of Helsinki.
Tommi Reen, the police administration, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The amount of bicycle theft goes largely according to what are the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense city centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
Espoo, for example, is a very different type of city, where urban centres are at a distance from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport,” says Reen.
In the whole of Finland, there have been slightly fewer bicycle thefts in January-August than in the same period last year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police become aware of just over 20 000 bicycle thefts every year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and only about 4 000 bikes a year in Helsinki.
They are large quantities," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report theft of bicycles, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are reported.
A typical bicycle theft is one in which the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in the blood.
Cases can also be found in connection with another investigation, when, for example, in a drug case, stolen wheels can be found in the apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from shopping centres’ bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja is the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, via the internet.
They remain in the domestic market.
At least it has not been known to the police that stolen bikes would go abroad a lot," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bicycles are ordinary Finns.
Some people will probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some of them may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a hidden offence or violation.
Alarm bells should ring if a well-functioning bike is sold at a clear price,” Reen says.
Senior Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the Kallio library in Helsinki for the entire working day.
He has had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen," says the elk. "Never taken, there has been a good monk."
Perhaps this is not so attractive to thieves, there may not be any hipster value here," says Helsinki-based Hirvi.
Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike was squeezing against the kiosk wall, but usually Valve locks its bike in a fixed frame, such as a bike rack.
It will take a lot of thought, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki who says about his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
All the time I hear from my friends that the wheels have been taken away.
Mostly bad bikes, such a sloppy Jopo.
A bicycle was stolen from the valve itself from the courtyard of the housing company a year ago.
However, the bike had not been locked, so Valve was waiting for it to be seized.
Are you under 15 years of age responsible for your crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-to-peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal responsibility.
The peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender himself may join the jury to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may include a family letter explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used side by side.
Everyone steers the young person’s actions in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined by the first mistake,” says Laitio.
The peer jury is modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person does not face an adult panel after the first crime, but reflects on what happened about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service design agency that followed the experiment, Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, says that this was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
The first crimes of children under 15 years of age in particular may not have been dealt with at all before.
It has been a message that you will continue along the path of your choice," says Lovio.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki Youth of Immigrants project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to all those who need them, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding the Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the US newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, an open letter is addressed to the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be channelled to the Congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his indifference, incompetence and record-breaking disfavor, threaten to bring an avalanche to the democrats in these elections," the letter says, according to Politico.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in a Trump ornamental anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as the chances of Trump winning the presidential election are reduced day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a prominent anti-Trump Republican.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of acts by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief for US families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton explained the details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am looking for a president to make the US economy go well for everyone.
Donald Trump is striving for a president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by the tax increases of the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a hand-stretch for American workers who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paid jobs since World War II.
We are a building nation, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to facilitate the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, however, he sounded like Sanders, emphasizing that the rich should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it will have to pay the tax at source,” Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
As [President], I am opposed to any trade agreement that works against workers or wages," Clinton said.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise the economic programme announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "favouring only such millionaires".
Trump's proposed rebate on corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's loophole".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small entrepreneur.
He reminded listeners of small businessmen whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and clothes that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are Rio’s viewing figures: The races have not glued Finnish to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear as sharp mountain peaks in TV viewing statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a huge number of viewers.
At one time, 12 per cent of the population have been glued to the screens: Tuesday evening swimming followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison, the European Championships in athletics one month ago attracted almost 800 000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Championships in football attracted well over another million.
So far, the Olympic sports have been most interested in Sunday evening cycling and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, head of sports, is pleased with the number of viewers, and reminds that for the first time at the Rio Games, viewers are divided into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns are also watching the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the number of TV viewers who choose the Olympics at all.
On the television side, viewers are also distributed to TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports games for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When broadcast 24 hours a day, and there are viewers from 20 000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts come at night in Finland.
Another reason for the dilute interest - if someone now considers it dilute - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the first races, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as are other Finnish sports of interest: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, the viewing figures explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the competition in the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150 000 times.
I’d bet we’re already around 200 000 downloads.
We will only get the viewing figures for the network later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
There are updated versions of the applications that should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics are more visible on Yle’s channels and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be followed from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio, Yle Speech broadcasts the races every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last that can only be followed through Yle channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 meters at Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technology diving instructor Matti Kanela found a printout of about 20 square meters on Ristiselkä, the bottom of which was 104 meters deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried to strengthen the observation by echo sounding.
The method may not find a small recess of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Over 80 meters to Lake Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
There may well be unknown depths," Kantela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In this sense, your Son will not be among the ten deepest ones and Suvasvesi will still be farther from the top.
Correction 12 August at 14.29: Corrected the last paragraph where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Ihalainen from the tax sector: Taxation of pensioners continues to be tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that maladministration came up under parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised equality with employees.
This is not included in the government proposal.
In our opinion, that should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be followed after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received income reductions that eased taxation.
The matter was heated in Parliament by opposition representatives who embellished the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (Co.) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Finance Minister Petteri Orpo on tax cuts is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, as salaries will not be raised next year.
He says that a tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä’s (central) and Orpo’s messages on the desire to honour the competitive agreement reached with difficulty.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done with the help of labour market organisations, so it should not be misled by questioning.
This is necessary because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people’s own faith in the future.
Prolonged unemployment in the barn
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was about 17 000 more than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s target of raising employment to 72 per cent will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of protracted unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No known Finnish victims in Thai attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and in Finland last night.
The Embassy calls on Finns in the country to pay attention and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is advisable to follow the embassy’s instructions with caution,” Westphalen says.
Very little Finnish in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there is currently very little Finnish in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand takes place at the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to find out more about the situation in the city, especially in Hua Hin.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalia says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalia, there is still no information on the perpetrator of the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thai divided society and the recent referendum on the constitution of the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who reportedly objected to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is a ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It is a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalia says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
The traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks would affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism is also excluded, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand over the past 24 hours, with 11 bombs exploded across the country, such as in tourist-popular Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in the tourist destination of Finland, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require any fatalities.
Two of the bombs exploded in a newspaper in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was wounded.
According to local authorities, four bombs have exploded in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one person was killed in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village and town of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
It is also known to many tourists as it leads to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayt Chan-O-Cha, leader of the military junta in Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not encourage people to panic any more," he told reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators had intended to destroy the country's tourism, as all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finns in the country to pay attention and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is advisable to follow the embassy’s instructions with caution,” Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
So far very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
Last night's attack on Hua Hin has given us a bit more information.
It killed a local woman and injured more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the second attack of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded as an attraction near a well-known bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found one more bomb.
According to the governor of the province, the suicide bomb in Surat was hidden in a flower bed.
An employee of the municipality died in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
The police chief, interviewed by CNN, said that two bombs were also used in the attack on the city, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles wins women's four-game
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60.098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia with the third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for scaffolding championships in Rio competitions on the pavement, jumping and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to an extent in recent years.
He had eight personal world championships for the last three years.
He has won the four-game and permanence championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last year and the year before.
In the US team, Biles has won two world championships.
The fainter World Cup medals have a jump and boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "The attack has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombing on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I don’t think this will result in anything more marvellous, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies near Thailand.
There is always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a avian influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If even these past ones have not expelled tourists, then this is hardly the case.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
The villa heard about the attack from its own employee.
The employee called around 9 a.m. for local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
The villa says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put because of the Queen's birthday, says Huovila and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere was calm and the movements on the main street were allowed to open around 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o'clock in the day, the traffic in Thailand was normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the impact site, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the impact site.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmitie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men with signs hidden in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately caught.
Another left, but a man was later found in the woods with a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to the motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the hints.
Director of Research on Russia’s leadership changes: Clear Exclusion
On Friday, the highest-ranking change of leadership took place in Russia, when President Vladimir Putin dismissed the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino from Estonia.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second man.
The brook says that the reason for Ivanov's separation may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been caught up with other leaders or messed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, an insider of Putin, will take over special duties in environmental and transport matters.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other positions and proposed to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in the station.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but the president rose to Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin changes his immediate family to a younger age.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when withdrawing from Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarbulus so that we would not target them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbiji Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarbulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to Isis.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected earlier news at 19:30: Previously, we misreported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually the Isis fighters abducted civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document publicity policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participants in the Ministry of the Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the minister’s calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Director of Communications of the Ministry says to STT that the Ministry has noticed a need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time under the ranks.
In the early part of the season, he broke his hind legs and had to skip the Jamaican Olympic Qualifiers.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I have practised well and that is the key," Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included little-dressed samba dancers and fan-turned journalists.
Around Porina Bolt, it is underlined that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt's last loss at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200-meter initials by 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose exercise attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and the competition's self-confidence, despite the final celebration of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career point with a watch.
The world records of 9.58 metres and 19.19 metres in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and a 19-second record, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
At 100, Bolt's biggest challenge is the 2004 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin of Athens.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundredth second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost in the finals of a prestigious competition if he has just made his way.
In Daegu, the 2011 World Cup final was left unrun by Bolt for cheating.
Bolt fills up in just over 30 weeks.
He is an old man of the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final goalline for his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I am older and this is more difficult.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio disclosures: two athletes suspected of doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi found traces of banned substances in a doping sample.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
He finished fourth in the women's 100-metre butterfly swim in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide could have been found in the sample given by Xinyi on Sunday.
Other suspicions of doping have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female fluid runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping test with signs of an epo-hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has moved from Rio to the home of an athletic coach due to doping.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) reported that a Kenyan coach had performed as an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping test on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan running coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre running Ferguson Rotich race pass.
Phelps won't stop anything - historic gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, U.S. Michael Phelps, swims in a 200-meter mess with his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive race of the same sport.
Phelps won 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was second in a mix before Chinese Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun," BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
Helen Skelton’s (right) Monday story is one of the most read on Iltalehti’s website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not stress much if there is a little noise in the social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress with at least enough exposure - at least for the eyes of many conservative British spectators.
However, there are no back steps.
It’s important to look good, and the little ones are just a fun thing.
Skelton is sure to want to startle and perhaps even startle, but he emphasizes that he does not want to play the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We are watching sports here, and the focus must be on sports.
It should not matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the upheaval has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that focuses on how hard these swimmers do their job and how much sacrifice they make is ok for me, Skelton grins.
Do you know what?
It's a tumult from nothing if it comes from a (host) dress.
I am a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio Police made two arrests for suspected terrorism
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety control of the games.
At the same time, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects were Brazilians.
According to G1, people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were already arrested by the police in July.
The detainees are believed to have links with the Islamic extremist organisation.
The detainees had reportedly incited violence on social media.
Among other things, messages to encourage violence were posted on the popular WhatsApp service.
85 000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police exploded a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed it to the public.
The police let the public in after the package had been blown up in a controlled manner.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that the police have carried out a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The public got in after the police had blown up the package in a controlled manner.
The audience did not reach the stadium by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police detonated the package and did not let the public into the hall until then.
He woke up the Spanish team that had started the race sleepily.
With two losses, Spain won Nigeria with 96-87 points.
In the last two competitions, Spain achieved silver.
Police carried out a controlled blasting task for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.

Argentine lady banging Petäjä-Siren - Finnish reflection on protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren experienced hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady banged Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the start of the day of women's surfing.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away," Joakim Wilenius, Finland's chief coach, said.
The athlete considered protesting for a long time.
It was not worth it, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finns hung on their board until the last day because they didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
With the accident, Finland remained in 27th place.
In total, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in London is the eighth.
With regard to the tip, the crash did not have much effect.
Friday is an important day when we are competing for departures 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life lengthens.
Sometimes, things that a person cannot influence themselves can bring him or her additional years.
These include a tendency to middle body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't always have to throw yourself in - just applying for a milk can is enough.
The secret of longevity has been investigated through a variety of studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre results of the study.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "decreased risk of death", especially in neurological or cardiovascular diseases.
Studies on alcohol suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can prolong a person’s life by up to six years, a study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases in the rest of the human body.
A study in Norway looked at how laughing affected a person’s life span.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54 000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test.
Sex, when it is taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, simply having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of his or her life, he or she should also have an orgasm.
Of course, exercise will bring additional years, it is not a denial.
However, reaching a long life does not require absolute saltiness.
A study from the University of Oxford found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it’s an athlete who has reached the Olympic medals or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live beyond the usual bunnies.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring additional years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which, on the other hand, makes it possible, for example, to seek recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over the age of 65 found that a person shopping every day was more likely to be older than a person shopping less often.
This is due to the fact that turning around in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring about death.
So, count your credit card in your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driving driver derailed into a truck
A serious truck and passenger car crash took place on Friday evening in Koske, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place at Koskentie and Sorvastontie in mid-Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that had arrived had drifted into the lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck remained in its lane, but burned.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car went into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972, who carried a passenger car, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to the Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of drunken driving.
Mail sent loose candies to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket’s selection of loose candies, because the mail had delivered part of the load accidentally to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was on Thursday buying loose candies from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose sweets, because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We will receive more when Posti receives the delivery of the load!
If there is no congestion in lawn mowing, the sign reads.
The trader’s foxy sign relates to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
Lawn mowing is available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with surprise.
Representatives of the media have been calling all the time, and the attention this raises is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia’s update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to grab her own favourites in a bag of loose candies, even though a few of them were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the transport services business of Posti Corporation, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The reason for this is that three of the five stages were diverted yesterday to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we did not go on to do part-delivery (Salo) three more, but we only took five stages today," Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
The first news item on this issue is the Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not indignant with the sign because she found all her favourite loose candies in the selection.
30 kg lighter Lotta Backlund published a picture of her change
The comedian producer has slendered dozens of kilograms since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of life change.
Lotta shared a couple of photos on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss contract in 2009.
He has undergone a total lifestyle change and has slowly lost 30 kilograms.
On Friday, Backlund published a couple of photos of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
The Backlund before and after pair of pictures has collected several commendable comments from dieters.
You are wonderful.
We are on the same journey, motivation is hard!
Piia Korinen, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your photos when you travel the same way, another says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Let's Do it Now project.
At that time, he told the newspaper that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was ten kilograms away.
During the three-month fitness course, the kilos eventually dropped to five.
Family wishes of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered for police dog work instead of flowers and addresses.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the family’s wish for donations to the benefit of police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoon Veterinarian Centre and also completed his/her practical training there.
The veterinary clinic remembers with words that touch a woman.
Cheerful, smart, humorous and unafraid of work.
Dear friend.
We still cannot fully understand that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donations go to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own yard in the village of Koskenkylä in Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbours have said to the Evening newspaper that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a cock.
The 27-year-old man suspected of the murder did not know the woman and they had no contact with each other.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was injured in the arrest.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court handed down a judgment to Posti in breach of the Equality Act
Posti was not entitled to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise himself with the leased employee, the District Court of Kanta-Häme estimated in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the salary of the lecturer, which corresponded to the share of the induction throughout the day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the Union for Postal and Logistics PAU’s decision on the prohibition of induction.
During last year’s November postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees did not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who violated the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Ps.) in their reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in his letter, the Association of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression to Turkey.
Putin sacked the head of his administration - the Estonian-backed Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
The Soviet communist leader Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will replace him.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
Persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax says.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's tight-knit inner circle, will be assigned to special tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to the Kremlin's press release.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other positions and proposed that persecution be replaced, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB spying.
Many considered Ivanov to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but the president rose to the rank of Dmitry Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin's re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU gets banned - not seen in Premier League opening
The world record for football transfers is not seen in the field when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed in England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition of Paul Pogba is sidelined by a ban when ManU opens its league on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said on Friday.
According to British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million for Pogba to the Italian club Juventus.
However, the English Football Federation (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was left out of Juventus.
He received two warnings at last season's Italian Cup and will be banned from playing a single game.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, madness is a virtue
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival’s position as an internationally acclaimed event, which is starred by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival’s event area is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just have a main stage and a beer tent,” says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind the success is: what kind of event would the creators themselves want to go to?
In event production, it is quite different to think so.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors to 70 000 last year by 5 000 people.
This year, the festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because the activities must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled by huge lanes.
That is not what we want.
During 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been expanded so that there are 130 performers, art installations, as well as numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area decorated with artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage performances, the venue this year is a tent for 15 000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I’m a bit crazy, but at the same time we’ve been able to keep Flow’s spirit.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even big visions are practically possible today.
In the early 2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of around EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "creatic things" like the construction of the 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not deliberately profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit into Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan base in his genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked, because this is probably the last time we will see her at a gig in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
Not just what is played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and she has been doing damn good gigs in recent years.
Thai tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and exploded with the help of mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were blown up while tourists started leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, according to police representative Samoer Yoosumran, CNN.
Since 1989, the protector of wild animals in Asia, Edwin Wiek, has referred to the much-discussed image of the attacks.
If you don’t see the tv here, you can see it here.
At least 11 people injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The people ran up against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It took place on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time exploded with two bombs in the city.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which is also popular in Finland.
No one is reportedly dead.
At the same time, another double-bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bombings, who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organisations that traffic in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby troops will first go into battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are only ordered to fight after several months of taking the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Chief of Training of the Finnish Defence Forces, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, who serves 5.5 months in a military situation, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible to fight.
According to the training manager, first, reserve personnel are assigned to the service.
No conscripts or reservists are ordered to perform a task that has not received the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training conscripts in the units of immediate preparedness as of next year.
If necessary, the units can be used for military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola gets huge compensation for a homestay
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house was EUR 330 000.
However, after the transaction, the house revealed a serious moisture problem, which caused a dangerous microbial plantation for health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in a demolished condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal issued a judgment in the case on Wednesday.
It maintained the judgment of the District Court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the costs of the couple’s trial and investigation.
The court moderated the price reduction a little, because the buyers had already been aware of the need to repair the apartment when the purchase was made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the construction errors that had occurred were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
Tola is looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a good home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had come to the conclusion that the building had been renovated and in good condition, and that there was no harm to the matters mentioned in the condition inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and flaws of ventilation and the fact that the control of rain and melting water flowing along the rock surface is not sufficient.
However, the discussions did not indicate that this was in any way a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that rainwater from the rock might have to be controlled a little over a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
In the inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013, the building found microbial vegetation, which according to witnesses were caused by both rainwater on the rock and soil moisture that had risen capillary.
On the west side of the house, it was estimated by the inspector that air contaminated with microbes could also enter the interior of the building via the veranda.
Moulds or yeasts above the limit values that enable a health risk were found in brush samples in the utility room, in the basement staircase, in the window marker in the living room and in the washroom in the basement.
The terraces were built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision to amend the apartment in violation of the permit prior to the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, mould problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the transaction, assume that the building was suitable for living as it was and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that there was no special reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their obligation to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children to the Nazis - also Finnish in the register
In a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes about the total number of 218 500 women who wanted to marry SS men stored in the National Archive of Microfilms in Maryland, USA.
Most of the women are Germans, but there are also Americans, Frenchmen, Dutchmen and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become a Nazi bride.
Documents and registration cards come from a breed agency in Nazi Germany.
The Finnish Race Agency served under the SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children before being examined by an SS doctor.
The same goes for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were carried out on women to investigate the matter.
The Finnish Racial Agency examined women’s backgrounds, for example, by studying church books.
The aim was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breed agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Finnish Racial Agency wanted guarantees that the women were "child-loving", "sparing", and "good national socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The article does not tell you what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that every SS man should have four children, either inside or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, according to the website of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The honorary cross of the German mother was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, according to the museum's website.
Petäjä-Sire's sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the Finnjolls’ day at the first departure at the Rio Olympics, but remained at the top of the team at the second departure of the day.
Nirkko was 8th in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day departures at positions 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470s, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren left 23 at the start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are number 19.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna recorded a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so caught up”
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has made the cruise ship’s bartender king of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dance stages and festivals, is still on the verge of turning upside down and he is currently in a rush.
Jari Sillanpää, a book about the life of a favourite singer by Mari Koppinen, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career took off in a total take-off when he won the crown of the tango king on the Seinäjokin Tango market in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen arranged in a slightly different format.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us, however, that the recording of the song did not go as planned: Sillanpää sang on the tape with a terrible hangover and just after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so caught up!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that has become a huge hit would not immediately guess that it has been sung in a hangover.
Even though I was not physically at my best, the imprint was still good.
I learned that it is not always necessary to claim the perfect and the highest.
Another coincidence related to the man's songs, which is reported in the book, took place almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time and the case ended up in the text of the song "You deserve gold", which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true, it was written on the basis of news from 7 days.
In the newspaper's news, Jari's and ex-love's separation was explained as the reason for Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but according to Jari, it was a complete bunny and was not correct.
According to the book, Jari played to the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the polling week's polls predict the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their view of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid," flew into a scrap box in the UK's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides the profession with answers to the Brexit disaster.
The typical answer is that economists were not listened to because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the reasons economists explain is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still imagine that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it’s out of the UK.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing, as it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were christised by the fairness of the BBC, which allowed just as much room for a couple of percent of economists representing the EU’s withdrawal as for an overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in explaining what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, LSE and other economic power combinations think of the consequences of the breakup.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with which voters do not feel that there are common interests.
Academics like economists in big cities would have remained in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants will take your job, immigrants will congest your hospital, immigrants will take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every café has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would a British doctor’s appointment be if they didn’t exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they got rid of them?
Foreigners live in each municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they disappeared?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepared for Brexit in Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
In Aberdeen, he said, early preparations were made for Brexit by drawing up plans for A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the victory of the EU-based camp, began to be prepared a few weeks before the vote, in case the result would be a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We started to grow cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," says Vanhanen of Aberdeen's only open daily quote of the real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The value of the fund at that time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds of the UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or even below 10%.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trade
When the EU-based camp won, Europe got confused.
However, the two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, they sprang up the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund had to close its doors one after the other.
Aberdeen’s situation was good because of the cash raised, but it also had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worth taking the money out in a panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it won’t be worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down the situation, and most withdrew the notification.
Since then, the market has been fairly stable, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks,” Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen’s continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonably attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closing of real estate fund transactions received too much attention.
The open funds affected by the closures account for about 4% of UK real estate.
Aberdeen closed for six days and sold out less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may hold its funds until 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been razed down, but the situation does not seem to be "worse" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought some real estate investors even new opportunities, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market in relation to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought minuses to the London real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning the situation did not seem very good.
But at 4 a.m., when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate investment manager of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That was the power word.
I realized that this is now going to Plan B’s side,” Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
The City of London was already fully alive in the early hours of the morning.
The TV screens, which were normally silent in the office, were telling the news, and the usually loud crowd was completely silent as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed red only.
It was the kind of morning you would never have thought you would live, says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in the UK, completed two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. on Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, which is why the situation was calm in a way," Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote started a correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate severe declines in the UK property market, especially in London.
London's office space was expected to have a minus of up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of UK real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after the other.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty is still raging in the air.
It does not appear to have been on the face of Vanhanen this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about what will happen with Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the London real estate market has already been obtained.
The real estate service company CBRE’s data on price development cover about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the office buildings of the City of London, the minus was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and there have been worse figures for only five months,” Vanhanen says.
All equally large falls hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
Olden thinks that the comparison is not quite apt, because it is now a home-grown crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like those of the past, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There is also funding normally available.
The repair could have been in front of you anyway.
In fact, the correction of prices is no wonder to him - one could have been in front of him without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other world’s number one cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City, and especially the offices, are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
So the fall started really high.
London’s prices have been upwards for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is becoming globalized, says Vanhanen.
The Middle East and Asia have become new players in the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, the prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new properties.
On top of this, the loan has been easily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the debt lever has now been used clearly less than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the rise in prices levelled off last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some twist to be expected, and now it came.
What to do from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to judge much for the future, but says that there will hardly be a surge.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or flat front.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And still he is an optimist who believes that the pits can be overcome by work.
If you are prepared for the risks well, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim.
If there is a decentralisation, the risks are also decentralised,” says Vanhanen.
S Group begins to register shopping data more accurately than before
S Group knows what you are eating, because today the trading group announced that it was starting to collect even more detailed information about its regular customers’ purchases.
So far, when information has been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin to collect it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
S Group comes after Kesko here, as the information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used subject to authorisation for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group registration change.
Kesko already categorizes its loyal customers according to food purchases alone into ten groups.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchasing information is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not currently planning to do so.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty program, which can be joined in the selection houses, Siwa and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product or product-level information, we will stick to the total amount of the receipt.
In other words, we know in which store the purchases were made and on which day and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the same level as the K-Group or the S-Group,” says Anu Ora, Commercial Director.
According to him, the loyalty program will be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
At first an experiment
SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal data and address data, basic data also included occupation, education, form of residence, and the years of birth and previous personal data of children.
Persons belonging to the same household and their role are also registered.
The purchase date and time, place, the total amount of purchases and payment method are saved from the S-Emotion Card purchase.
In addition, the S-bonus partners’ information has been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Home Terras and ABC chains, data is currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Activities.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored at the checkouts in any case, whether they want it or not.
A willing person can check his/her deposited data on the S Group website.
For example, the cash registers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is the latest dog confirmation from Customs - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever’s kitten sneezes vigorously at five boxes placed in the same row at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila to play with his favourite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of powdered gas-scented sockets was revealed.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the dog Heila.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be located at Helsinki Airport next year.
If needed, the duties of Heila and Suntio may also be taken to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs and, after the attacks, supervision has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and an explosive dog for Customs’ duties are postal deliveries through Helsinki Airport.
With the increase in internet sales, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport every year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 finds related to weapons, parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine registered luggage and postal items.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila-puppy training is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio will also train with Heila at the police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to be chosen for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is in contact with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at the home of Suntio, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing can be done without Heila at home, says Suntio.
The subtle orders go to Heila from the one-off box.
The cameraman of the evening messages loses the cover of the microphone for a quick dog, but Heila returns the cover that looks like a soft toy right away from the command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
Level tests are still ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron a dog wearing work vests, says Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately 60000-70000 euros per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active working hours only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a fierce competition for working dogs in Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees were applied for as the owner of Heila.
Onni was hit by Suntio, who has not had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and supervision duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
The Olympic gold of less than one million inhabitants of Fiji in rugby is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was resolved.
The holiday is held the day after the team returns home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in the capital Suvalla, where a screen had been erected on the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage," said Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish lifter fainted after a ferocious performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one has been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos and 145 kilos from the rapture.
His combined result was 320 kg.
Tokola tried to push 175 kilos at the last, as well as each other.
At the third company, weights rose accompanied by fierce roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lifting.
The joy of the Finnish lifter was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Football Club, which plays in the men’s football league, has concluded a lasting agreement with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player for our team who has the power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
Together with more than ten players, we went through more than 50 players from all over the world.
Little by little, the crowd started to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa," RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinn's Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi residents will meet the Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goal king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Voluptuous Modern Family star shrugged again: teenage star shorts reveal almost everything
As a friendly Alex Dunphy of the Modern Family comedy series, Ariel Winter reintroduces her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also this backside.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour to become much bolder.
The star has been posing on social media in very few photos and taking numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very tight outfits.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has also recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If the image does not appear, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
In this case, Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television for almost his entire life and grew up in the age of the Kardashians.
He’s learned that the more you look at the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood,” says Palmer to Fox News, adding that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has infuriated some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she will be in ten years’ time, when the downhill is already so hard,” says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her not to care about criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, a young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the Northern Lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese tourists to start Northern Lights trips already in the early autumn," Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
The northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly linked to heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a good demand for winter Northern Lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and continues well into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision a double fairy tale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 who live in the city and dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, for example, by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers at Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more clear and unique sights in Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights have enormous potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown significantly more than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting as a target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
UK settles for rugby silver with Fiji's championship course leading to gold
The UK's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed to Fiji's last challenge at the Thursday night final, when the team experienced a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji held a masterclass in handling, chewing, dodging, supporting, running lines and sheer power as they won their first Olympic medal.
With the defeat came a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third of the British Day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic games at the rugby start-up tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The heavy 7-5 victory in the semi-final played earlier that day in South Africa may have bothered them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a top-notch team of 15 in this condition.
Britain may - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach is Ben Ryan, England's former boss from Wimbledon.
Great Britain's journey has been quite a lot.
Eight years ago, they, coached by Ryan, lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This backlash hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started off excellently, fighting UK tackles for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was as if they were running towards the moving buses, and the World Cup led 5-0 after Oceana Kolinsau dived into the finish line at the corner.
When the clock had four minutes, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped the third goal scored by the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa, but it was only a slowdown for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, and the UK lost 17-0.
Nakarawa scored again a new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock...the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through the loose tackles of Great Britain and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the goal kick, the situation was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that is how it really is.
The UK took a break from the blockade of changes that blocked the Fiji Dam... for a full four minutes, which, compared to the first half of the year, was fine until Josua Tuisova scored a goal after Fid's impressive feed game.
Dan Norton scored a goal for the UK at the left corner of the touchdown and narrowed the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was difficult not to admire Fid's joyous approach.
Mata Viliame with his last minute paint had a frosting on Fid's cake, which did not need to be frosted.
The whistle was blown, the Fijians hugged and the UK fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan in the semi-finals 20-5, and the UK won in the tough semi-finals in South Africa, where each scored one goal - Britain's goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took over South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with dazzling footwork and scored under the goalposts in the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside rugby team Anthony, secured a victory and finally a silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to a rowing victory
There will be no gold in these competitions that is more shocking than emotions, and that really means something.
From the first draft to the last, 220 heavy drags on history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagola.
While they were rowing together, there were three voices on the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was present all the time as the duo ran into their second consecutive Olympic gold in a women's pair competition - the first women in British sports history books to reach such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes joining the surface with the grace of the swan, does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Each rowing gold is based on a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually contribute to the things that matter, and no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, after 30 months of cancer diagnosis, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was concise.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed surgery.
If they do not cut, it will spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It will change your mind a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start her treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the season, where they caused as little disruption as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thought of the couple was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an Afghan commander-in-chief of the Royal Artillery Regiment, said: “I’ve been an emotional ruin this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me.”
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we would not be anything, so he owes a lot of thanks, he is the best coach in the world.
I could not have imagined a better trainee or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition in five years.
The pair set a tough rhythm that their competitors could not reach.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very caught in an instant.
Helen shouted “stay in the process, stay in the process”.
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, we are just looking for a good rowing and winning the race, and so we did.
A couple waits a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will be attending the wedding next month when she gets married to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say this was my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland changes government over Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which will be called for by demonstrators incited by the Panama leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians have circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to the analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last spring rage of the people will affect the election results in the autumn.
In June, the presidential elections showed a clear criticism of those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate for non-political status, was elected.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald Trump, the presidential candidate of the United States Republican Party, withdrew his latest remarks.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the co-founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and the co-founder of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was angry at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be the commander-in-chief of an army who can sink down like that," Clinton said.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a Muslim-favorite burkini bathing suit on beaches, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
According to a decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard, it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swim to anyone who does not have a swimwear that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which largely express religious affiliations, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the object of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two members of the Islamic extremist group attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through a sieve - Lake Pyykösjärvi blue algae cloudiness
Water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue algae clouding has been observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action Agency took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria from all bathing waters on the beaches were below the measures laid down in the Decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations in the water at Meriniemi beach were secured on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue algae opacity observed on the shore of Lake Pyykosjärvi does not yet make water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue algae bloom, resulting in blue-green algae mass forming on the water surface as rafts.
The environmental action follows the situation with more frequent inspections.
If the blue-green algae clouding turns into blue-green algae bloom, it will also be reported separately on the notice board of the beach.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkainen forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside Finland
The forest gift reduction is one of the changes in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction that would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal for a forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of the forest.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest holdings is good, comments Juha Hakkainen, Director of Forest Management at the Central Association of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
However, Hukkainen finds criticism in the proposal for a tax change.
The forest gift reduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner’s clean capital income.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkainen, the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal starts from the fact that by reducing the clean capital income of forestry, it prevents the loss of the capital income of forestry that would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would benefit from the tax even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complex.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkainen says.
In addition, the model only applies to a small proportion of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the return value of the forest is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkainen.
As such, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The Ministry of Finance considers that the border guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the farm.
In forestry policy, the forest gift reduction has been exported for decades, according to Hakkainen.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Strong hailstorm surprised motorists at Himanga - two cars crashed into a ditch and crashed into each other
A special race took place on Friday morning in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the rescue department, two cars in a row went into the ditch, after which the driver came across the front.
According to Harri Pyyhtiä, the fire master on duty, the derailment to the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a severe hailstorm.
The car behind the car had two people, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the above car was not injured.
The accident took place on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research from researchers at the University of Turku can help to make cancer treatments even more effective.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research team show that the hardness of a cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos’ family home killing continues at the court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
The family home killing in Muhos continues in court for both of the convicted.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for the family home killing in Muhos.
The second received 8 years of 4 months of murder and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The sentenced person was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and of transporting the vehicle as a young person.
The district court’s judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the parties and the man who had been sentenced more severely.
The prosecutor calls for a less penalized man to be convicted of a murder committed as a young person for 12 years.
Were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the District Court, the 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a child welfare officer at a school home in July of last year.
The 17-year-old sentenced to death, according to the judgment's reasoning, attacked a pilot sitting on the couch in the back of the living room.
The director had let go of his grip and led the young man into his room, and one of the youngsters hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a mental study, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned to leave the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate shark in the world, only increasing at the age of 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark, according to a study published in Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, an ice shark, i.e. a busher, can live up to 400 years of age.
Females only increase at the age of 156.
The lifetime of the ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows by only one centimeter a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers discovered age at radiocarbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests conducted in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, scientists were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The age of the eldest was estimated at 392 years - although throwing in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Up to a third of all state taxes would not be received if the change to corporate tax imposed by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with tax incentives that benefit the wealthiest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There is really a huge amount left uncollected, $1 000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6 per cent, followed by a reduction of 33 per cent proposed by Trump.
The inheritance tax would be completely abolished.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of business and of running small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards decided on in haste must be reinstated and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
The "destructive" trade policy, according to Trump, is one of the main causes of the United States' problems.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and from Mexico of 35%.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will be driving on the streets, American planes connecting cities, American ships controlling the seas, American steel lifting new skyscrapers all over the country.
Contrary to what he did, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to the Republicans, see the Trump programme leading to a deep economic recession in the United States.
Hillary Clinton announced her own programme early Friday in Finland.
A tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is in a fatal turmoil, but the real tide strikes in the middle of Madrid's street hustle and bustle - accounting with the past can begin.
That is the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodovar’s previous work Travel Lovers (2013) was a fun and dirty satirical comedy, the preceding Skin in which I live (2011) the tops of my Spanish virtuoso career.
Julieta (2016) is situated somewhere between the two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship, and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be on its model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be surprised all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Juliet times the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins from the time before the birth of the daughter, from the time when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will take up the second leading role in the television series Semmet (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a chord, but I would say that it's time for a swiping.
Often for Almodóvar films, there is so much humor in Julieta.
It is an evenly-played, restrained film with good music in some places, and a rather sad film with elements of elegy.
Instead, the typical visual saturation of the Spanish director is preserved and begins to slowly enter the eye more as a pure form than as a functioning dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are affected by diseases, deaths or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally choreous.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of the name person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular ears.
Almodóvar is very precise in these matters, but the main thing, that is, the exorcisms of the scene in question, do not improve on this in particular.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly infertile.
Almodóvar has written a book based on three short stories by the Nobel Prize laureate Alice Munro.
The short stories have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly uniform literary filming.
There would have been a lot of material for an emotionally incomparable drama, so much big things - especially the gnawing guilt - the thematics of the film deal with.
Director and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on 12.8.
Government is trying to win elections - People's News
No new cuts will be made, say the ministers, so that the Finns in general will not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made by a lot.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (Centre Party) say under the budget session.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM’s proposal, because the cuts to social security were already decided in the spring spending limits discussion.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Education cuts continue.
Municipal elections are haunting
Why is it that the ministers are so hard at stressing that no new cuts are made on top of these?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal election result, which takes the parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the Gallups report that the Finnish government party expects a roll-over loss, even though the result of its previous elections was modest at 12.3%.
Four years ago, the True Finns received 752 new delegates, most of whom will be realised next spring at the cost of influencing the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the government of the three approximately equal parties depends on the ability of the Finns as a whole to survive.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of the government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's state of fermentation have also come to the surface.
The new cuts will not come, first of all, blurs the fact that next year they will be made violently and, second, attempts will be made to soften the shock that awaits the Finns.
Major surgeries in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different - if the government of Sipilä is still standing.
The Government has set itself the goal of reducing the debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take a debt of EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands mid-term and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: the debt will not fall or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be built at least close to balance during 2018 and then, in the spring, we will receive what comes in the parliamentary elections.
Indebtedness is not covered by these measures
It is quite clear that indebtedness will not be reversed by current measures, even if Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove it inexorably:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no support for the international economy.
The Finnish economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except during a temporary stimulus policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this decade and has increased from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros per year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost approximately EUR 6 billion, which will be covered in practice by taking on a whole new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party as to what is responsible.
Question: Municipalities want to be left with a lot of tasks
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity for children is the responsibility of the municipality, according to research conducted by the KAKs - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also rolls out responsibility for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management to an individual municipality.
The county is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities.
There is no desire to transfer any tasks under the responsibility of municipalities to the state.
A minor drunken driver ran after the chase to escape the police
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol at Ilomantsitie on Friday night half at one time.
The police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle that had driven without lights, but the young man left to drive the police at a fair speed.
The pursuit continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from there to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after that, the young man ran away running, but the faster-legged policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
The breath test performed on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license that would justify driving a motorcycle.
Among other things, the case is being investigated as a serious endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck in a stone load fell into a ditch
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch on Lake Polvijärvi, Kaavintie, on Thursday evening at 21.15.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into the ditch.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the overturned truck through the door together with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
The car owner was left with the task of raising the vehicle.
The fallen truck spilled hydraulic oil on the road, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police investigate the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in Ilmajoki
Since the afternoon, a 87-year-old woman has been staying in Ilmajoki Bay Village in Southern Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about 165 centimetres long, slim and well-knit with white hair under her chin.
Observations and hints of lost movements are requested to call the helpline of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre 0295440513.
Major-accident materials in the air - see photo gallery of Parafest's destruction
The rush flow that fell into the tents of Parafest Festivals caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially on its feet, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest’s last performer, Kalle Salonen, performed on the market stage at the end of Friday evening.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances on the City Theatre premises starting at 13 a.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
A surge flow occurs in a thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger a drop in air flow.
The changes in the state of the water in the thunderstorm bind heat, and therefore the decreasing air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several surges occur in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of downturns.
The surge hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, there were about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child, who was transported with a slight injury to further care.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for the ageing of the skin is air pollution.
The UK study is told by the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses London’s most toxic fine particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, for example, an elderly person living in rural areas.
Small particles ageing the skin are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, almost 9 500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have found that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
A Caci study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who travel on their commutes near busy streets.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution with different masks, for example, but it is recommended that the skin be cleaned regularly.
The tractor's brakes failed - shoved the man in front
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man did not get under it, but the tractor managed to push the man so much that he was transported to the central hospital after further investigation seriously injured.
The tractor could not run further, as it came across the rocks in front of it.
Fancy the season ahead with new forces
League-Riento from Joensuu, playing in the Volleyball Championship League, will start in October with a series of better starting points than men’s memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
A common tune can be found better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Riento.
Jani Säisä, who continues as the head coach of Riento, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni starts his second season in Rieno.
The new face is the 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who appeared in the Rwandan national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passport, the Brazilian has a measurement of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and Jokipoika to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost all of the world championships in floorball since 2003.
Now the sixth competition is going on in Tampere, only in 2013 was missed when Canada was better at the North American Qualifiers.
I was working and playing with women in Turku when I noticed the announcement.
The USA was setting up a floorball team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, the kind of sport was not yet played at the SM level like the floorball.
The spade was played at the university.
I played basketball in Juniper and later ice hockey in Jokipojat in the Finnish Championship, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship in 1991-92 with the university, the following three seasons took place in Josba.
In addition to playing, he prepared the club's A-girls for the championship.
Women's Finnish Championship culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the Women’s Finnish Championship through 10 seasons, with a balance of 169 matches 51+34=85.
The latest season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
Josban grew up by Perttu Puska and Enoist-oriented Tatu Väänänen was chosen to join the Finnish national team, which plays in the Czech EFT tournament in Brno on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men’s national games before, where he has a total of 9+4=13 power points.
Swiss defenceman Wiler-Ersigen’s 32-year-old defenceman Tatu Väänänen has recovered from the femoral problem and is a member of the national team’s standard fleet with 117 national matches.
The national team was also named as the veteran player of the Seinäjoki Game Brothers, Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at last December’s World Cup.
The head coach of the floorball team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley virtuoso Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to finish as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volley Championships will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
In three days, medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the Finnish Volleyball Championship organised by the Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best teams in each league will be qualified.
The local colour of the event is represented by Essi Hasu, who grew up in Elimäki YMKY, who has been a member of the top beach volleys in Finland for several years.
Today, Hasu lives in Helsinki and is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope that as many people as possible will be able to go to the auditorium this weekend.
There will certainly be a great arena for the stadium.
I’m not very often in adult leagues in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu says.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu’s spark in sports and gave him a good start to a great hobby.
There are very many memories of childhood.
I started playing volleyball at the age of 9 in Elimäki YMKY's E-girls.
The main thing in mind is too big a shirt, knee pads on the ankles and ace cries and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were heavily involved - the team mate's father coached us and our mother was the club's chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was a natural choice for indoor volleyball in junior times.
A track has been played on the Curve pond beach since the 1990s.
The operation has always been active.
I also went to watch the juniors’ Finnish Championships, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays the weekend together with Anniina Parkinen from Pieksämäki in the SM-finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We are still missing the SM gold in the prize cabinet, Hasu throws a mystery.
This weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be Hasu’s last in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, there will be new challenges in civilian work.
The international career is over after the tournament in Kisakallio.
Otherwise, the flip flops will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Fall flow poured tents at the event of disabled people in Joensuu, the earthquake was near

Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 17 a.m.
Markus Viitaniemi, the fire officer interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that there were ingredients for the incident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Solomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweat and energy.
The young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future even in rural areas.
Just two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, started working as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come into the hand of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always enjoyed doing things on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything into play.
If something starts, I think it has to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a barn, and the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I myself was very brave to join the project and I have been fully involved in it,” says Solomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of clean Finnish food and that everything would still turn out to be good.
The goal of Salomon Koli, a meat-growing company, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the Young Food Producer’s Competition of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the newspaper's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (after June 2012) and the first figure above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The average annual inflation measured by the cost of living index was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The life cost index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 the price of the following consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat’s “anime” effect is rated as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filter, but according to some observers, it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to modify their reality and play with their identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that would suit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, face-twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All the missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized for advertising a blackface mask or a bleached skin color as an ideal.
So when Snapchat promoted a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, slanted teeth, and plump cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people – a yellow face.
And they wonder if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company’s greater problem with diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later, Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to the anime characters, not a caricature from Asia.
But the lens of racism experienced observers was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied the comparison of anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet on photos was widely shared, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that “it is difficult to argue against a comparison between a gross Asian caricature and filter effects.”
It shows that the filter is not only yellow-faced, but yellow-faced with extreme demeanour.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge audience of young people who are more racially diverse than their parents can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Twenty-five-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an offensive image for the user, “it’s much harder for these types to be unobtrusive than before.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing for Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that race-related disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white male leadership and ended his writing with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat)
Either they don’t have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions,” said Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they would feel safe or could speak directly.”
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to respond to.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its personnel, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its staff, but according to a representative, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and take forward internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say that this is not ok.”
According to Congress panel, military officials misrepresented Isis intelligence
In a report published on Thursday, the Congressional Panel said the US military headquarters had modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against the Isis than what the events on the ground justified.
The interim report of a working group set up by the Republican Chairman of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Budget Sub-Committee found “widespread dissatisfaction” among the head office intelligence analysts who said that the managers tampered with their assessments of American efforts to defeat Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters of the military division in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The outputs of the intelligence typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground, which were consistently more positive than the analyses produced by other agents of the intelligence community,” the report said.
Centcom's events are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when poor analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said Ken Calvert, a representative of the California Republicans.
The failures of Centcom’s management reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the persistent problems in headquarters descriptions and analyses of US efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that reports have been ordered to be tampered with by the high-ranking administration of the Obama administration, it describes analysts as if Centcom leaders were putting pressure on them to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
Throughout the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
For example, the Centcom authority publicly stated that a major attack on Mosul's return could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
After months of investigation, this is very clear,” said Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party of Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence officers at the U.S. military headquarters manipulated the intelligence outputs of the headquarters to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic state was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will follow more extensive results in the course of the investigation.
The Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has initiated an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's inquiry.
On Thursday, the members of the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican working group.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a unnecessarily isolated process for the intelligence assessment of the Isis and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the Committee’s Chief Democrat, in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process “prolonged the release of intelligence outputs”, reduced the mood among analysts and “did not give enough space to divergent perspectives”.
Schiff and the Democrats said they could not find evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions with their “pre-set or political narrative”.
The Daily Beast will report on the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Chief Inspector has started an investigation after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Senior Inspector's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence hold a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues.”
The investigation has other repercussions, other than just the question of whether the US-led bombing efforts in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the increasing number of defence officials now claims).
Last year's allegations questioned how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to provide honest estimates of the war effort in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the Islamic State intelligence reflects a dispute more than a decade ago when the Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that, despite the objections of several analysts, the regime of President George W. Bush supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about what the consequences of the 2003 attack would be.
Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection on Islamic intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group, as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in women's field hockey, organizing a round-up with Britain
The day after the three goals were scored by the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the US women's field hockey team on Thursday, with the Americans winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he was not sure if he had done the same before.
I have no idea," he said.
I’m not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals.”
But this he knows: Americans are in a 4-0 position at the Olympic Games and they share their team's first place with Britain, which was still unbeaten after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will face the first round in the final game on Saturday.
Both teams have survived the quarter-finals, and this game determines who will be ranked first and who will be second in their group of six teams.
First placed to avoid a strong Dutch, second group leader, a little longer at the start of the quarter finals.
No matter how the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have stirred up with their surprising success here, four years after they left the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a ground hockey stick for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel) in connection with the team at the age of 16, making him the youngest player ever to play it.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to participate in the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, English Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We did not have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We have made a complete translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started his first half goal with a knuckle stroke close to the goal.
India had won a single victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation in 1-0 readings until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then toured the middle and pulled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth round.
This zero game was the first US goalkeeper to win one goal in each of the first three wins.
He is in a good mood.
So is Bam.
We have a good situation now,” Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Trampoline peace in the midst of the Olympic Games
Wherever you are, whatever the time, the Olympics are in progress.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable message of fierce competition and effort.
As if the Olympic torch itself was a flaming baton, passed from the archer to the swimmer and from the gymnast to the triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on a TV, read a newspaper or listen to a conversation with a guest in a café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-timer at the Olympics and the future heartbreaker with his smiles, could well be one of the names everyone knows, presented at the best viewing time, supported by sponsor contracts and good-natured TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Further away from the centre, partly in the shade, are those species that are not universally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have breaststroke, long live it.
But if I can make a decent number of my special favourite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000 when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, there has been so little attention to its presence in the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian medals are usually distributed by men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLennan are defending their London gold medals.
However, the trampoline is associated with a certain charm of the underdog, partly because the uncivilized ear sounds more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, I am just a flightless fan.
The sport has opportunities for amusing, as you can see from the vibration of the endless bouncing of drawing films, but it also has the grace of gymnastics and swimming jumping, two species that are basically combined in it.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means springboard.
The champions jump on a giant trampoline up to a height of almost 30 feet, and they have to perform swinging movements (turns, folds and flips) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and ‘flight time’.
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women competing in Rio.
The most common course of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those looking for a medal need to go further, faster, up and over - sometimes until the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are not only hunting for a goalline or a starting wall, but also, in television news coverage, another trembling line: a world or Olympic record.
This purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and it can even get the viewer to tears.
But that’s also the reason why watching a race can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline provides a moment of rest from this.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The rival rises again, appearing weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then easily up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no ferocious rush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, only a dreamlike, fluid interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to the zen state as can be reached at the Olympics.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at 13 (ET) at the start of the broadcast, men's competitions will also be held on Saturday at 13 a.m.
NBC broadcasts the finals as part of its afternoon programme starting at 14 a.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is probably not noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only reached by offering male athletes to stare at and objectify (as the US gymnasts suggested some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his groaning new fandom.
Generation Demonstrates” in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of demonstrators have been killed in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as it spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets, demanding a profound political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was relentless.
Witnesses said the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
The proliferation of videos recorded in demonstrations, believed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how security officials beat young people with sticks while they were forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
Keeping this country together was always difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager for the International Crisis Group in the Horn of Africa.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat the terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western assistance.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved tremendously, and the capital Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model for democracy, human rights organisations have constantly talked about government repression, the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this can be changing.
If you suppress people and they have no choice but to demonstrate, this will happen,” said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is demonstrating.
One generation is demonstrating.
The complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition over land use to strangle.
After the much-criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last place held by the opposition, and now it holds all seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing. The struggle along this tense and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why bitter emotions are now exploding under the surface after years of turmoil.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate via network proxy servers that hide their location.
Many young Ethiopians said this was the way they met for demonstrations.
Second, Ethiopia’s two largest ethnic groups, the Oromos and Amharas, get along better with each other.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, succeeded in politics and business by exploiting oromas, many of which are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella,” said Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by the Tigre people, who account for about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
The current administration has no such basic instinct,” said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desallegn, was picked relatively unknownly to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that security services controlled by tigres do not trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such a turmoil was in 2005, when thousands of people protested at the election, which analysts said seemed to be being hugged by the government first and then robbed by it.
In the ensuing attack, many protesters died, although fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But this clearly has not stopped the internal disdain of the Ethiopian government.
And now it is beginning to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the city of Amhara in Gondar attacked Tigre-owned companies, and anti-Tigre hatred is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say the demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring Somalia, although it said some time ago that it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
This," Abdi said, "is real balancing.
Donald Trump explains his Obama-founder-Isis claim as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to thwart the latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he inked several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during the turbulent period, in a difficult position, in which they must explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
Following an insinuation at Wednesday's campaign meeting, Trump argued more and more enthusiastically in Thursday's interviews, where he induced that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning Twitter post, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a complete turn-over from the previous day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was really serious about the allegation.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump flatter his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took him to his ears.
The latest review storm comes when Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the midst of declining opinion polls.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
As he fled again to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used the sarcasm defence before.
Late in July, when he faced widespread criticism apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I am sarcastic".
The approach allows Trump to speak at the borders and then return if necessary.
I think it’s a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then ‘clarifies’ in one direction or another depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is cunning about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of relieving his speeches to the general public, Trump has been more elusive in recent days as his popularity continues to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump lags behind Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tough in Florida.
While Trump tends to avoid apologising for provocative things, he often blames his critics for misunderstood his words or misunderstood his sense of humour.
As he faces an ever-closer scrutiny in the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they have to publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, made a lot of effort defending the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
I believe there are real, political comments in his words,” Giuliani said when asked about the truthfulness of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans claim that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which grind his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked the "bad, pitiful" TV experts who tried to find out about him, saying, "They will not succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse as new evidence that he was an inappropriate president.
Formerly closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but one that provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, Bedford Avenue’s streetside was too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals lamented it's last loss in a middle-class city to be reconstructed.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is a soap shop today.”
But if New York is a change, it is also a reinventing.
Revived Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unsophisticated atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new venue.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new location, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things intact.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and buys the same type of espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches, for example capers and browned onions.
The bowls contain brown rice.
Beer is no longer served in the café, but fresh juices are made there.
During the nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers, too,” he said.
One of the last Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he went to the café.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up coffee for a while.
I understood that I enjoyed Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his regular ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before work and always placed the same order.
Every day, fifteen or more, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagels with butter,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes, due to variation, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says that he does not carry any resentment for the soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to prepare a special soap for Verb, which is used as an ingredient in cold-extract coffee in the cafe.
I think we can still seize the offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it up soon to some point in order to make his new neighbours feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand into an adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favourites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a frequent flyer and said it was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When a new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he had come home when he walked in and ordered a coffee.
I had longed to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: Paralyzing Food of the Depression
In March 1933, shortly after the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated Fifth Avenue dishes, such as goose liver paste, and Maryland’s swamp toad soup.
On that day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, plum pudding.
It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American food during the Great Depression.
By showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist at the Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unsophisticated lunch bar in the Flatiron area that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
When the journalist ordered a meat loaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the eating of the depression.
The loaf was very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There were peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from a compound and some cheap ingredient to continue the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make up your dinner.
Coe grinned.
It must have felt like lead-heavy on the stomach,” he said.
In the years before the recession, American tables, especially in the countryside, were like eating-as much-as-as-you-cans-pick-up table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The American people sent food to the hungry during the First World War. The book A Square Meal chronicled the ways in which a nation managed to cope with the sudden fact that it was no longer a land of abundance.
At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mysterious foods such as loafers and boxes became primary foods, and the box was a “great way to use food scraps”, mentioned Ziegelman, because chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been at the heart of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special compositions were tried when the calorie and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
In the course of the study Ziegelman also prepared an era dish in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter for a book containing recipes.
It was not a popular addition to the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said, “It was unreal.”
Peanut butter is in no way suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or since.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become ‘budgeters’ and respond to the challenge of converting lumps like pureed spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a traditional treat.
Especially tasty are the reports on the government’s reactions to hungry citizens, such as the attitude that President Herbert Hoover gives me to eat cake.
At the same time as he publicly praised his childhood as a simple, Iowan country food, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that “provided not only one of Washington’s most dreary, but also the worst prepared food.”
Many of the depressive eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, how she could not throw away food.
He was really afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: “He even made people sick.”
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
It’s called plum foam,” Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give the modest recipes a prominent name.
There was no cream in the dessert, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone submerged their spoons reluctantly in a sticky, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe sanded once and for all.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife: “Slightly chopped walnuts could help.”
Gilad to be compensated for his lawyer's expenses in the hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
The U.S. court of engagement has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc. be entitled to the attorney's fees it incurred in a case involving a patient with hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released for $200 million in payments after breaking two of Merck's patents relating to the successful drugs of Sovaldi and Harvoni, which followed the discovery by an American judge of Merck's abuses, including false oaths and other unethical practices.
In a judgment delivered on Thursday, US court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilad was entitled to be released from the compensation it was granted in the event of an action being brought.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market in the new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can clearly cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for the ownership of sofosbuvir-based laboratory work.
U.S.-backed forces say they have taken over Manbij completely controlled by Isis
U.S.-backed troops have taken over the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, a representative of the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of soldiers hiding in the city left the city.
The troops had released more than 2000 civilian hostages who were held captive by the fighters from the Sharfan Darwish SDF Allied Force, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
The city is now entirely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it,” he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2 percent federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her spouse's income in that year was $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charitable organizations, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's nominee, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia with his wife Anne Holton, published 10 years' tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a benchmark for financial transparency,” Clinton campaigner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
As usual, U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the Tax Administration for a refusal to publish tax returns.
Your turn,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he published a link to the Democratic candidate’s tax returns.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, a special adviser to Trump, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were completed.
Trump critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem by publishing an online video on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans who are urging Trump to publish their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
He refuses to do what every presidential candidate of the past decades has done: to publish his tax return,” he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted numerous tax attorneys and accountants on Friday who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also has an audit of the Tax Administration, and that Trump is not “fearful” of the tax collection agency, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate of the Clintons living in Chappaqua in New York was around 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was around 40.5 percent.
Clinton's tax return for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was an affordable, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $109 000 in dividend and interest income.

Chilli powder condoms and firecrackers enhance elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - they throw animals with condoms filled with chilli powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, along with the American Nature Conservancy, developed the idea several years ago, has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step approach to the protection of homes and hundreds of animals without hurting.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
Since we developed the...tools, we have seen a change in attitude in these communities, which are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, Executive Director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include pointing an intrusive elephant with a flashlight and playing the horn.
If it does not prevent the animal, throw the so-called “chili cloud”.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chilli powder and ground and a firecracker, after which the condom is twisted so that only the ignition wire remains visible.
When the condom is ignited, it bursts and bursts the chilli powder dust into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air. The fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticises Berlin hotel that removed Israel's heading number at the request of the Arabs
The French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area code, according to the employee, due to the "requests" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the film Shoah about the Holocaust, broke his frustration with the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of country codes offered by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call centre.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker raised the matter at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response from there “shook him.”
The hotel’s recipe expert said it was a “considered decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels”.
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s area code,” the employee is said to have said, according to Lanzmann.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case “a great injustice,” Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But the even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This does not need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident produced quite a counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply “give up” the claims of Arab customers.
Shame on,” said another publication, which pointed out that a hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what had happened “inattentionless” and “apologies” to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
A clear order not to include Israel in the quick-track list was never made," Kempinski's representative said, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students protesting
On Thursday, the students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, where they met to protest against the reform of the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to break up the student population, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
According to the proposals of Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, governor of the State of Sao Paolo, a little less than 100 public schools would be closed, and 300 000 students would be relocated to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after the protesters set out as a team to support Dilma Rousseff, the detainees, while the country's Senate voted for her indictment.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is growing suddenly by 71%
Since the lifting of the sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Naturally, one of the main objectives of Iran’s bilateral cooperation is to expand trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, net sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015, totalling $856 million.
Russian exports to Iran in particular increased by 91.5%, totalling $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
The growth in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Mission in Iran issued about 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia for the first time.
It is safe to say that last year’s record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz, and Yazd to preserve the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
Scottish Callum Skinner crashed while the British captured cycling gold
Scotland’s Callum Skinner praised the men’s team print at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night, when the British team team defended its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role where his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, the legend was proud of the young man when he rushed to the finish line, winning a pre-favorite New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won his fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after being modestly placed in the sixth March race at the World Championships in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and the London Games was the replacement of special envoy Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time when Hindes appeared.
The end of Hoy also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches in relation to the Scottish potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner made the Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was behind in his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the deformation, and included Hindes driving in a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert on the BBC and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes’ attention when they stepped on the podium.
23-year-old Skinner said: “The comparison is flattering.”
I am here just to do my best and gain a reputation.
We made the Olympic record in the final and won the World Cup.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and British rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "It felt like it was in London when there were so many British flags on the base."
As a team, we found a link in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply fantastic.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten cycling races in Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be looking forward to a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
On the basis of the condition shown by Kenny, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic golds in one Olympic Games.
That would mean that the total number of medals for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that apparently holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Next, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I am enjoying this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
It will be won together with friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the rank of a knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four-person, four-kilometre team pursuits in time.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London, the 2012 gold world record is 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will take place today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the centre of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before time runs when officials invited him to length measurement.
In a similar women's competition that will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald progressed in world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take over the central part of the Olympic Games and reach a whole range of medals.
After presenting in Beijing and London a truly exceptional and perfect management, expectations have been underestimated before the Rio Games.
There has been a drama, the least of which has been the difference between the technical director, Shane Sutton, in April due to charges of sexism and temptation, and the end of the career of majors such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first-night races at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain’s now legendary reputation could rise to its peak at the perfect moment once again.
Portland's smeltered future calls into question due to cuts in electricity contract
The future of Portland’s Victoria aluminium smelter, as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs, is uncertain when a power company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the factory’s owners is about to terminate the distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year not to continue the support required for the operation of the plant.
The 20-year period will end in November.
Up to 2000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
Up to 2000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10% of Victoria's total power supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland smelter loses money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which started as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of the factory's production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it would also expect the other three owners to terminate their contract.
The majority of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina Group, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
AGL is looking forward to the continued operation of the Portland plant, which means that the undigested physical electricity demand will continue,” it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called ‘protection agreements’, which were supposed to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of notice, which means that they will actually expire in 2017.
That’s why AGL expects contracts to deliver results for the financial year 2017,’ the electricity company said.
All possible results for AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently constrained by the strong outlook for the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it has already lowered the value of contracts by $187 million in its accounting.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the smelter’s supply of electricity”.
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that it was supposed to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts have been alert both to the smelting of Portland in Victoria and to the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, as the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier this week, AGL Executive Director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants exit the market, this will be a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
As an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing for us,” he said.
Kendall, not just the reality TV star of the Kardashians, is on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, the fourth daughter of the clan of Kris Kardashian-Jenner, a model and mother-manager, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's September issue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and modeled at the Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a quirky (or perhaps only in the style of the Kardashians?), a scripted reality video in which the entire clan of Kardashian-Jenner (excluding the problem cases of Rob and Caitlyn, and accompanied by everyone's favourite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but which ended with a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a cliché plot of almost every children's television series' "birthday episode" (Seacrest says "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a morning-drawn bunny), but Kris had to somehow get his other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly entered a new era of the Kardashians with the place of the September Vogue.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made Vogue's claim first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue of Vogue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee book than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832 pages of the last year’s book were advertising content).
Therefore, the disclosure is expected to be so intense that for the last two years, the images from the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more “celebrities” on the cover than “models that are celebs”.
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga's honorary position.
But if it happened that Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the “success model” of his generation, would fall into the first category, he would be in a pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars, or today’s youngsters who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are decently talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year’s cover model, Beyonce, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
In his reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be difficult.
In June, the original Victoria’s Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them “the bitches of the moment.”
This feeling resurfaced with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction rotation is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He is a model for Marc Jacobs.
She will sell you Estee Lauder's foundation.
She and all her sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the paywall.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she took to Love magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he is a reality star.
Community Legal Centres turn away 160 000 people each year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the legal centres of the Community each year as the sector prepares for the impact of additional cuts in funding on its already-extreme activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the opportunity to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away as they seek free legal advice and representation.
Legal services, which have already been extended to the limits of the Community, are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres will lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
The legal centres of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means thousands of unprotected residents of Queensland will be forced to navigate through complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice, as well as to Queen's Senator George Brandis, to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and its client communities, and the government of Palaszczuk should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after an employee was allegedly threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the campaign's head of operations in North Carolina threatened an employee in February while driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit brought by the former software trainee Vincent Bordin of the State Campaign in Charlotte on Wednesday, at the State Court.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that it would not happen.
Chief Earl Phillip “brought out the pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the barrel against Vincent’s kneecap,” Bordini said in the action.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had the same experience as Phillip, said in the action.
Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage,” Bordini said in the action.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate provoked indignation in telling the public in North Carolina that "the people of the second addition" - usually including gun owners and gunners - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to elect judges.
The Trump campaign said that the media has taken his words out of context and that he does not support violence.
Bordin’s challenge is to seek compensation from the campaign for careless surveillance and from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Hope Hicks, a representative of Trump, did not respond to the request for comment immediately.
The attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news company in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call request submitted to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump campaign has been controversial.

Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity to the whole stomach, not just local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we made great efforts to ensure that all of our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone and youth unemployment will be eliminated around the airport.
As well as before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready to compete, and that we would be put to shame in the face of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and a £211 billion economic growth, as well as leave the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and in budget: from T5, voted the world’s best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to T2, built between the world’s two busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by £16 billion in private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion is also one.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that the UK can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse play to block ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, companies bypass the ad-blocking program are “cat and mouse play,” said one of the companies manufacturing such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its computer-based website, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update the program filters to block again ads on social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code would be changed around advertisements to make it more difficult for advertisers to see which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it has circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back and forth struggle between an open-source ad-blocking community and its circumventors has been going on ever since the ad-blocking was invented,” and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how great the trouble with ad blockers has become for the industry.
Globally, around 200 million people use ad blockers, reported in last year’s Pagefair and Adobe study, which is almost four times the number of people who used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is behind the ban on advertisements for pages that are used on computers, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, a representative said.
Computer ads are still generating enough revenue to make Facebook consider this type of action worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it updated its “advertising preference” tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying, as they would also block some of the non-advertising content on the site.
This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem,” a Facebook representative said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman caught in a car on a Swiss motorway apparently due to suicide
The victim was on a highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman was left on a motorway under several vehicles in the early hours of Thursday in a case that was apparently suicidal.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and settled down in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud's police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all of them have yet been identified, according to the police, who appealed to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to register.
Criminal investigation has begun, which is a “logical” step in this kind of situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the involved drivers will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, where there was a person walking on a dark highway, it was estimated that motorists could not expect to encounter a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were acquitted of negligence after he hit and killed a man on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had gone out on the road, the court reported.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, were driving in a justifiable manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “a completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone who has information about the Thursday incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, water-free surfaces and the atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, could at times have been ground-like.
Scientists have previously argued that the slow rotation rate of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet probably had areas drier than the Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variation to enable life and to protect from rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of being 30 percent dimmed by the sun.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that acts as an umbrella to protect the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the current Earth temperatures.
The model produced a story of Venus's developmental stages, similar to what planet scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be habitable at times, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escapes, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with lethal greenhouse gases remained — the Venus we now know.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up the position of Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the position of Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of ice hockey, stating that this was the reason for the lack of influence in the decision-making process of the team.
Joe Sakic, Deputy CEO/Director General of Colorado, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
For the past three years, I have been doing my duty as Vice President and Chief Coach of Ice Hockey at Colorado Avalanche, with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I have been thinking for a long time about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the position of the coach and the Deputy Director-General for Ice Hockey must be fully in line with that of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Patrick told me today about his decision,” said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the league’s best coach Jack Adams Award in his first season of Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Minnesota crashed in the first round of Colorado playoffs and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche games in the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing a wild card playoff position at the Western Conference.
Roy, the chosen goalkeeper for the Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The labour struggles of oil workers in the North Sea due to pay are postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations," the chief negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been arranged occasionally on the North Sea drilling rigs led by Royal Dutch Shell.
The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT Associations can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute,” the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to the trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, the Wood Group cut the North Sea contractors’ fees by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company’s remuneration follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced the payroll of thousands of people and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company lightens its operations as a result of its giant fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the UK’s June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour disputes in the North Sea of the generation.
He said the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
We need an economy that works for many, not only for a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country,” he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to receive less than $1.4 billion in investments in new projects in 2016, while the average for the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades
The mission of the latest Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to compile the most complete list of the rotational speeds of the stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at varying speeds, as well as how rotation times are associated with planet formation.
We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Centre for infrared processing and analysis at Caltech.
The Pleiadian star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, and are just now reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning at their top level.
At its peak speed, these adult stars are plunged by large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as sun spots.
The latest list of star speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, from whom bigger ones make devils slower than smaller ones.
In the “ballet” of the Pleiades, we see that slow spinners are usually more massive, while the fastest spinners are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Since the Plejade star cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for estimating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
The Pleiadian star cluster provides an anchor for the theoretical models of star rotation, which include both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and so to speak, hang their ‘dance shoes’ on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejade rotation rates in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
