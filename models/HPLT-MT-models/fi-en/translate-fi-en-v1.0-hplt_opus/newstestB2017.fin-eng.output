28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a staircase at a local shopping centre this week.
The victim's brother says he knew no one who wanted to harm his brother. "He had finally put his case in order."
The body found at Westfield shopping centre on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Department of Forensic Medicine.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is investigated as a life crime.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job of becoming a chef at the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to all of them.
We are a small and close team, like a family. We miss you very much," says the representative.
Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends.
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally settled his case.
He found an apartment and had a girlfriend," said Louis Galicia at the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he knew no one who wanted to harm his little brother.
He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to get into a dispute with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was an unscrambled diamond that shined every day," he says.
Anyone who knows anything about the case will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline 415-575-4444.
Strike junior doctors call for new industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors in the UK (mainly specialised in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested permission for new industrial action in the dispute over a new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC), a member of the British Medical Association (BMA), is seeking support from its entire government for further labour action from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the Chair of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, posted a letter to members of the JDC saying that the government "silently" on issues that, according to McCourt, led to the rejection of the agreement.
In the light of this, the JDC government has rejected a completely new draft agreement and calls for new formal negotiations on all of our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA government requesting permission for the gradual expansion of industrial action from the beginning of September."
Because of the controversy, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, director of junior doctors at BMA, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
During the pre-vote meetings, Malawian said the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54 000 junior doctors and medical students voting.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would enter into force and apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally conclude the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg Palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties were shaking hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin and there was little heat from him, even at his own restrained standard.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin – five times, according to a report.
I myself did not keep up with the bills.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm quite the opposite.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the head of Russia has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing that Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the event was furious.
Putin, in strict words, attacked Ankara and accused her of stabbing her back.
The insult was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain true trust.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media campaigned against Ankara in depth and aggressively.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the reason for everything.
The most serious of these were the accusations by top officials that the Erdogan family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in the Isis-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdoğan has vehemently denied the allegations.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move forward.
At the end of the day, this meeting was only held so that Putin received his apology from President Erdogan.
This allowed Russia to make some sort of profit.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
Above all, Erdoğan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown in the failed coup d'état last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
Reconciliation is also an economic factor.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially with a charter flight ban, as it is normal for several million Russian tourists to travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly feel relieved when air transport can eventually continue.
They put their faith in the late season rushing into the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables, while Turkish agricultural products are allowed to import again.
Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in an article in the economic magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it thinks the West is reacting weakly to the coup attempt.
Not to forget the old resentment of the snail speed of Turkey's accession negotiations with the EU and Putin's intervention in the matter, which is eager to take advantage of the cool relations and break Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own deep concern about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey were able to convey the image described by an analyst as an "external alliance" by their summit meeting at the seafront palace: two countries that feel abandoned and abused by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The most notable is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peace builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents said at a press conference that they had not discussed the subject at all.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer the question of the differences between the two countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus among the countries as to where they could seek consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a full disaster caused by a NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian fighter plane, it is no doubt better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are again even on speaking terms.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS Bank, the bank’s operations outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally associated with the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to retreat from its goals when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, including Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now the foreground has been deemed right to let more national brands go.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but the abbreviation RBS will not be used.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWest, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "The RBS will become an investment brand and the reason why our staff will be there, because we are now becoming much more of a bank of different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our ambitions are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sport sponsorship.
Now is the right time to move into a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for our customers," says the bank's President.
Three years ago it would have been very scornful if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But the work we do and the focus on our customers’ needs instead of our own have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rides Prediction to win in Newmarket and reaches 3 000th win
The Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant his 3 000th victory.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3 000th victory in the British championship in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he achieved by riding his horse on the Prediction twice on the same night on the track of his own locality.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone on a level track in running races.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson have previously been able to do the same.
The triple champion jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface, because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because it was here that I ended up 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big one, not a Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-strong audience.
I am relieved and feel great humility."
Dettori accepts cheers with Prediction after winning
The two jockeys have reached a milestone in the obstacle race, and they are the champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4 300 times in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, 9-time Derby winner, 4 493 wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that she has just reached this milestone that few people have reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical ability is what sets him apart.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm and pruning has brought supporters to the sport for years."
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6 000 races if he didn’t compete only on weekends and only in big races!
Frankly speaking, Frankie's riding career in the UK has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been a great follow-up.
He is a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Franky Dettori ventilated his achievements in a distinctive way by flying down from his horse.
From flying arrivals to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been a model for British racing for two decades.
The trip has accommodated ups and downs.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 with "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived an air accident and has been out of competition for drug abuse.
When the non-competition three years ago ended, he had difficulty getting started, but he showed admirable strength in character, showed to his sceptics and returned to his best.
And for a while he’s not about to end his career – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue racing until he’s at least 50 years old.”
Putin dismisses Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his chief of administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted insider for several years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but no justification for the dismissal was given.
Anton Vaino, acting as Deputy Head of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the post.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President's Protocol Department and the Cabinet Office, says the Kremlin's Russian website.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had himself asked for a divorce and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are smiles genuine?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on Russian state television, both of them said that Ivanov would withdraw at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince only a few, especially under parliamentary elections.
Are they the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man who has been praised as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website shows Ivanov's words to Putin, in which he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me this very complicated and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
Now I have been President's Chief of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) that replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy head.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin's second term, for the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected to the third term.
However, the mission went to another neighbor of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – FBI investigators star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The series is produced by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which reported on the kick-offs in a joint press release.
Known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson had made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in a statement.
Information on how to write the character of Gibson out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, according to a press release from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, the 54-year-old Gibson has been a part of the series since its first season in 2005.
I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," said Gibson in a press release on Friday.
I was hoping to see the series until the end, but that is no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful production team and the most important ones: the best fans the series could have ever wished for."
The 12th season of the series begins in the United States on September 28.
The mysterious landing of fish in the Banff garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind fish that have been caught in the country by a cyclone.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published a vision of footage in Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five-centimeter fish.
The overpass of Queensferry is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry bridge and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "cover fans", which are now almost finished around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 rope ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of State for the Economy Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the crossing bridge of Queensferry.
We are all witnessing a truly significant advance in the construction of the bridge, with more than 30 000 concrete and steel being used for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete cover moulding in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted into place."
Michael Martin, Project Manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant milestone in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the top of the road and civil engineering industry.
After the last part of the road deck had been installed and attached to the road cover of the North Tower, we had to close the remaining north (i.e., on the ground) gap.
This was done by pulling the northern ground bridge 700 mm south.
This was a massive operation requiring high precision at the same time.
Massive, because the land is 222 metres long and weighs about 6 000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3 per cent.
And high precision, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small – just a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went well."
Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells about three men's miracle rescue
The three men who came out of their fishing boat in front of Anglesey were rescued like a miracle.
The Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station made an alarm on Friday at 13.20 a.m. local time after its crew observed an accident in the Bay of Moelfre Bay.
Three men struggled to swim safely while their boat continued its reckless journey without a pilot.
We saw the boat going around right next to them and we thought the worst," said Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately transported the boat away from them.
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while a third, aged 60, was found exhausted stuck in the buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all taken to a rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle that these three men who have fallen into the water are still alive and in perfect condition.
The boat's engine had an emergency cord, but for some reason it had detached from the man who was driving the boat during the crash.
They were really lucky in their journey."
Pokémon Go yacht brings health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to stay inside to stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go gets people out of the couch and out.
Originally, the screen time only took TV viewing, then there were also video games and most recently smartphones.
It is therefore remarkable to note that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
Pokémon Go is a game app that comes from a video game created in the 1990s (which was later made into a series of drawings, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also ended a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users in Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for the Pokémon on their smartphones that are tracked using GPS. Once a Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (with a phone screen image) or "capture".
The fad has caught up with the younger generation of the video game and raised their backs from the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps a "average person" takes per day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch smartwatch Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the launch of the game that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35 000 users.
The company does not know who is playing the Pokémon Go game, it only sees the raw data of the amount of physical activity.
Many public health campaigns, where people are encouraged to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have echoed in deaf ears, because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
The probability of developing cancer or depression is lower in those who move regularly.
Exercise helps to control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a great deal of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic things that support health – exercise, fresh air and the sun and joy.
It is even possible to make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes disapproving spoilers.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door while playing.
What about it?
A breakthrough has been made.
Because even though mobile apps like Fitbit might have tracked your activity before, they didn’t give you any reason to start as Pokémon Go does.
The charm of the novelty disappears, and the use will decrease in due course.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, there will be more games where applications and virtual reality will be combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people leaving the hunt and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles gold medal in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortless with a boom.
Jaws clumping on a permafrost.
Great at everything.
And now at last also the Olympic winner.
An American 19-year-old gymnast won a multi-match championship on Thursday and raised the distinction between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight at the Olympics.
His total score of 62.1998 was clearly better than that of the silver-based "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles from the United States will perform on the boom at the final of the multi-match for women's gymnastics at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The party became the fourth consecutive and all-time fifth American woman to win the multi-match championship, thus consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears when his total score of the final came out and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to completely new dimensions and puts him in the same category as other superstars in the sport, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 World Cup medals, including 10 gold medals, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest gymnast of all time".
In Brazil, there was still one final competition that took place, first and foremost, between the burden of Biles and his self and the burden of over-expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
United States Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman hugging after winning gold and silver at the final of the women's gymnastics singles multi-match at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of i with a team coordinated and now retiring to the late Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanence programme, which includes a series of volts known as his trump card, has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It is no coincidence.
As a young adopter of his grandparents, the discovery of the mother of coach Aimee Borman has become a powerful figure. Borman found the girl when she was in the gymnasium, where Borman coached.
He has not lost a single multi-match competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small lead with two twists, it was like a mirage.
There was a boom and a permanta, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He regained his leadership after a boom of 15.433 points and crowned the result with 15.933 points from the pavement.
Raisman gently hugged her while they waited for the final points – which was a mere formality – and tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white and blue glistening liner as the dream she once wrote in her scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a minor rendition of the competition four years ago, when he first split the third place, but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the re-round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call the team 'grandmothers', was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flight kisses to the public after his permanence program and thus rose from a loss position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, the widespread tweeting of this 19-year-old earlier in the week now has a whole new meaning:
Police report victims of three serial killers who listened to music in the car
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre in ten years. The victims sat in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, a police report was released on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on 12 June, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were killed in a car parked on the street.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, from where he shot eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car, the press release says.
The police suspect that the third murder was not the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take handbags or the $2 900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Spokesperson for Phoenix Police, sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the killing is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, which have occurred mainly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
What is common to the events is that they have occurred in residential areas in front of homes," Howard told KPHO earlier this month, a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are interrelated and that their perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital due to his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that the trio had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police issued a bulletin detailing the shooting of an empty open van just half an hour before the death of a third-party gunner, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found shells and took a bullet from the car seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital small head, due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, which he was not aware of when he was pregnant.
When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I would not survive this.
I can't get out of this.
I am not committed to this.
What is not true at all – of course, you are committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child should be placed in institutional care.
My first reaction was that I thought there was no such practice at all,” says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a rollator.
Edmund sat up and started to crawl at the age of three, and he still does not speak.
But he is slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth presents a sign that Edmund invented, by which she means "sing me."
We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean the usual sign language, but it also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of diseases: inherited, as in the case of Edmund, or pregnancy viral infections, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those affected by the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
I kept saying: what will happen to us,
What will happen to us?"
He still does not know.
I have not asked for a forecast for a long time, because I don't think anyone will be able to give it.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
Things tend to be arranged.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused large-scale rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the Governor of Louisiana declared an emergency due to heavy rains and widespread flooding. More rains are expected for the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-Eastern Louisiana and Southern Mississippi flooded over their banks and spread over a large area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the agency would receive requests for flood vehicles, boats and sand bags.
According to Steele, tens of thousands of sandbags have been requested by the Tangipahoa County alone.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to a press release issued by the weather service, more than 76–127 mm of water may enter the area.
A flood warning was issued in South Alabama on Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, is projected to rise to record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along the rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that the floods in Ascension County are a threat, as the flooded rivers are slowly draining into Lake Maurepas.
The River Tickfaw, which flows directly south of the state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue work continued in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were earlier on Friday near Gloster among those rescued.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other half of the boy, who lives nearby, had warned him.
We got up and the water came with a constant supply," Hansford says.
It extended to my waist.
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family members all have injuries, and he is the only one of them who can swim.
The rescue workers had rescued all three large military-style trucks and taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports from an observer near Livingston that it had rained almost 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil got wet after the rains that started on Wednesday.
The authorities report that due to heavy rains and flooding of the streets, residents of Tangipahoa County had to be saved from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the town council of Tangipahoa had told CBS' subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County leader Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
Shelters have been opened for evacuees in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to withdraw," he says.
In the city of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed due to the flood, and sandbags were offered to residents to try to prevent water from entering their homes and business premises.
The last time we experienced a major flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Board.
This flood seems to be the same.
In Mississippi, the rains continued to be steady along the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, Rescue Director at Harrison County.
Lacy says that on Thursday there was a report of a handful of houses under a flood, but so far there was no news on Friday.
The head of the Shopper Value Foods store, Keith Townson, says that he has lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
I've seen water in places I've never seen before, and more rain all the time."
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, who has received several bullets in his body, survives the Philadelphia shooting incident
According to the police, a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already another 6-year-old who has been shot this week in the city.
The child's grandparents told the CBS Philadelphia channel that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the boy had several shooting wounds in the groin, leg, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
He got many hits, his small body was full of bullets," said his son's grandmother, Delores Melendez, to the television company.
I can't believe this is true.
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was about to start the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
The second 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found on the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The venue was full of assault weapon-type shells from various assault weapons.
It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were sockets on both sides of the pavement on the street.
Several armed fighters have been present, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," said Anthony Ginaldi, Chief of the Philadelphia Police Department.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and it is reported that police are going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old victim of shooting in the city this week was a girl who was hit by a stray bullet while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
By this name, I call the women's gymnastics Olympic team, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been at every Olympic Games since 1984, and the United States has never been as powerful as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were ranked 1st and 2nd.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas won the competition, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the amazing performances and surprising and mastery of the world's three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez's gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in the women's singles multi-match.
Teammate Aly Raisman won silver.
The views are like this at the top of the species, but the same does not appear in gymnastics classes all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by their parents.
The facilities of most gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the activities.
The teaching of gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and this means that the families of gymnasts have an expensive and long-term commitment.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Borman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both coached the hobbyists since they started gymnastics.
We need to organise more affordable and accessible gymnastics classes for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have offered free or affordable gymnastics for over 15 000 urban youth (mostly black and Latin American) and some of these young people have achieved national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations in my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings life-long benefits and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has sparked enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnastics, and that's just great.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic gold medal, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their careers as healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes in remuneration and working conditions by approving a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37 000 junior doctors who voted rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister of Health Hunt announced plans to force an agreement and said the British Public Health Service (NHS) would be "no-man's-land" and that any further delays would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will enter into a new agreement, which will include changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in anomalous times.
The chairman of the BMA junior medical committee, Ellen McCourt, made a statement last night saying: "Junior doctors continue to be very wary of the proposed agreement, with a particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour market crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
There are only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so we have to move on now, because the time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has taken a reluctance and sometimes even no reaction in any way.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, cancel the contract and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new industrial action."
At the end of April, the previous strike postponed almost 13 000 routine procedures and 100 000 appointments, when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the striking doctors in the strike guard.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the British medical trade union officials.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend pay for 54 000 junior doctors who would be covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS, appealed to junior doctors not to engage in new strikes.
Mortimer says: "The industrial action will achieve very little or nothing, but it will put pressure on teams and services that are already working at the extremes and will cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, medical staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the disclosure of grievances.
The employees were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for returnees, training costs, mutual recognition of education, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector – was a sign of how seriously the employees, Health Education England, responsible for health education, and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May."
A medicine costing around €2.40 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are receiving a daily dose of approximately €2.40 when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer periods of time.
Anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), a member of the British Public Health Service (NHS) and evaluating the introduction of new treatment methods, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), part of the British Public Health Service (NHS) and evaluating the introduction of new treatment methods, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people get a heart attack every year, a quarter of them having a heart attack or having a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty material accumulated in the walls of blood vessels, which causes plaques.
If plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot falls out, it can travel with blood flow and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor manufactured by AstraZeneca in the UK, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
In the NICE guideline, published today, it is recommended that ticagrelor should be administered for the next 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a dose reduction to 60 mg and an additional dose of aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Institute for the Evaluation of the Use of Methods of Treatment (NICE) says: "While effective treatment methods are available to prevent the progression of disease and the emergence of symptoms, even a quarter of those who have had a heart attack will get a new attack or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on human quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Recommendation on the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since the data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited if used for more than three years, the guideline does not recommend the use of a treatment method for a longer period of time.
Due to a climate of political correctness, voting fraud in Muslim areas flourished
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed from office last year for corruption, as a result of which the government made a report
A climate of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals a government report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticized the police, election observers and city councils for having closed their eyes to electoral fraud for "the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
According to Pickles, a former minister of regional administration and a current anti-corruption figure, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside polling stations in order to protect the intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present a proof of identity in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter only has to give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to dip your fingers in an indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
More whistleblowers should be protected, says Sir Eric.
He calls for improved access for journalists to government documents and decisions of informal committees and working groups.
The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the voting scandal at the Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered Mayor Lutfur Rahman to resign due to corruption and numerous illegal activities.
The court held that Rahman "scorned" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by blaming them for racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to "use as the basis of his campaign the religious duty of every believing Muslim to vote for him".
Of the votes, up to 300 were questioned or given fraudulently so that a person voted by impersonating another person.
According to Sir Eric, there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the election fraud in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were reported to have put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric (pictured) made a number of suggestions to tidy up the voting system, including the need for a certificate of identity at the polling station.
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, particularly in communities with a Pakistan and Bangladesh background."
There was concern that... the state institutions had closed their eyes to this kind of activity because of the "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on the processing of postal ballots by political activists, in order to prevent the "harvesting of votes".
The current report by Theresa May also calls for stricter checks on registration to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options that would require voters to present a proof of identity before voting.
Baptizing your fingers into indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition of the handling of stuffed postal sounds and envelopes by political activists.
Police have the right to establish security chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Allowing only English at polling stations (except Wales).
In order to ensure that the staff supervises the rule that only one person may enter the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and finds it "astounding" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet incident.
The Electoral Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representatives for corruption and numerous illegal activities," he said.
He was found guilty without serious suspicion and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds.
He also criticized the ineffective "cross check" of the city council's electoral lists.
The court's decision last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call," said Sir Eric.
Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert election fraud and its denial by some.
The Olympic cyclist's resemblance to the duchess Catherine and other doubles are fading at the Rio Games
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games went wild this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for a championship who has a similarity with a well-known person.
In honour of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces appearing on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: US men's archery team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the Duchess Catherine, who was seen on cycling tracks, many people have listed on social media how one archer could be the twin brother of Leonardo DiCaprio, the actor's favourite.
Brady Ellison, a men's archery team in the United States, caused a storm after pictures of her on Twitter, strikingly reminiscent of the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise on social media and admitted that he had heard from his childhood that he resembled DiCaprio.
I personally do not see the resemblance as so large, perhaps with the exception of a beard and a mustache," Brady Huffington said to the Post.
He's a good looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment.
At the London Games in 2012, there was a similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, which will undoubtedly be highlighted even more in these competitions.
The great and expressive Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called the double being of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
The South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison from the Glee television series for years.
This user says that Nathan Adrian is the "atletic version" of the actor in the Inception film.
Similarly, for a long time there has been a similarity between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, which is accentuated by both powerful eyebrows and lips.
A swimming silver medalist, Yulia Efimova of Russia reminds actress Analynne McCord, not just because of her beautifully tanned skin and light hair, but also because the American team, Nathan Adrian, is, according to his fans, an "atletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
The two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and the actor Jennifer Carpenter (right), are similar in shape and eyes to each other.
Not only that, this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the similarity.
This user is wondering if there is a good reason for a pair to look similar.
A tweeter recently said he was delighted that "others on the Internet agree with the similarity between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and the actor in the Dexter series are really strikingly reminiscent of each other in their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also noticed similarity in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and in the wide smiles of Gabrielle Union, the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna returns!
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for saying Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Instead of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan, Byron MacDonalds' analysis in a women's 4 x 200-metre freestyle message shocked CBC's direct Olympic performance viewers on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologise after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smells" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started to excite his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC report team to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, went off at a speed and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam at the time of the second part of the message 1:57.79, remaining 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck in Canada, allowing Canadians to swim with China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane said: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the show yet."
Chinese Ai Yanhan, who was swimming in the women's 4 x 200 m freestyle relay, was described as: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly filled with raging comments from Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters did not hold back their words when they heard how careless Byron Macdonald was.
The tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly regretted MacDonald's speeches: "We apologise for the comment made on the bathing performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
CBC eventually had to apologise more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologise on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and glued its apologies to more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they reached the broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologised to our viewers, and we also apologised to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be deplored, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regrets in the broadcast and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not intend to make it personal.
I would like to apologise for the comment I made last night after the women's message swim," MacDonald said in the CBC Olympic broadcast.
I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Needless to say, I didn't mean anything downgrading with my words, and I'm very sorry."
In Primark, a woman who had made an arrangement in the middle of a shop without hindrance shocked customers
Customers did not know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to fit underpants.
He further aggravated the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underpants, taking them off the leg and putting them back on the shelf.
He went on a tour and finally tried out four pairs of underwear at a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark chain shop at Folkestone's Bouverie Place shopping centre, where a woman tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children who had been in the shop at the same time, says that, after trying underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the shop without buying anything.
He says: "People did not believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the shop, took the underpants off the shelf, stripped off her own tights and underpants and put them on.
He did not try to do it unobtrusively, but did it without shame.
Everyone looked when he took off the underpants he tried and apparently did not like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it again three times before finally deciding that he didn't like any of them, dressed and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about his eyes – and he didn’t think of a person who would eventually buy the underpants he had made.”
33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent town, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone takes home underpants that someone else has worn and hasn't been washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
I understand that the shop staff tried to remove these clothes from the sale after the woman had left – which is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underpants home and find that someone else has tried them without having washed them after that,” Davidson adds.
Primark's spokesperson said: "Primark is aware of the situation on Tuesday, 9 August in the movement of Folkestone.
All of these products have been removed from sale."
How to defend yourself against armed aggression with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, the New York Grand Master of the Krav Maga League, and asked for advice on how to cope with a gun in close proximity to a waving robber or assaulter.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker, depending on whether the attacker is approaching you from the front or the back.
If an attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab a gun so that it falls between your forearms and upper arms, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee into the groin, and when he goes through pain twice, slap him in the face with a gun barrel and retreat by keeping the gun directed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches the front. You need to move away from the firing line, grab a gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot trigger.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and strike the attacker with your fist on the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, retreat and keep the gun focused on the attacker.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
Keep in mind, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is by handing over your cash – unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Ian Wright, a world traveller who makes a travel guide, licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveller put his resistance and knock-on reflex to the hard test by licking the dirtiest and dirtiest places in Europe.
Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance to strength by licking the wristband, handrail in the Piccadilly Circus, the flush button on the train toilet and the Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and to show the viewers where it was forbidden to push.
The experiment was made into a documentary film Ian Wright – On the trail of inner power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the flush button on the train toilet can be sickening, but in fact more bacteria are found in the sink in the kitchen.
During his trip to different parts of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals to confirm good gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused but a bad mouth.
Ian Wright originally became known for his travel program, where he tested his gut endurance by travelling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Licking the handrails and the flush button at the railway stations undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the documentary: "I've been fairly carefree from my health since I was a child and have put in my mouth all sorts of things like soil, worms and curvature."
In the film, he really showed himself to be worthy of his reputation.
The border came only in a squirky public toilet in Russia.
Luminometer measured more than 4000 units of the sample.
For comparison, the number of freshly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border came up in the public toilet in Russia, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4000 units – in freshly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
In a documentary produced together with Valio, Wright explores Ian Wright – An inner force that makes visible the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary: "This is almost the worst smell I have smelled in any toilet.
4000 units! Nothing is dirtier than that!
The place is so sick that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright – On the trail of internal power in collaboration with Valio.
From Valio, Wright received Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut’s good bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of the category of Valio’s snack, juice and novelty products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We took a lot of time to come up with something crazy, and in the end we ended up with the idea of asking Ia."
Gastrointestinal health has become a global trend.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
Gastrointestinal health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film is also about our sense of humour!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Of course, it was easier for Ian to lick some items, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks filmed on the tape."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents attributed lactic acid bacteria in particular to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent reported that they had at least occasionally used products with added lactic acid bacteria.
Disturbances family destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall before eviction
The disturbing family left behind £50 000 in damage to a city-owned rental house after they had been evicted due to the terrorist attack in the neighbourhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their residence in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple had been forced out of the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company were shocked to find the apartment in a state of renovation.
There were gaping holes in the walls, the floor boards had been torn off, the debris had been spread on the floors, and the walls had been slammed with graffiti.
The couple have now moved and are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears that the apartment may no longer be safe.
He says, "This has been a complete nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to endure this kind of thing.
There is a lot to weigh, as the property is likely to become known not as such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family’s terror included street fighting on baseball bats, intimidation, drug use and transmission by nearby residents, and loud shouting, arguing and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an antisocial order.
Old waste was found in several rooms in the house under threat of demolition.
Previously, drugs had been sold from the house, and floor boards had been torn off.
According to the neighbours, the family fought on the street and the police were regularly called.
The Cornwall Housing Agency evicted the couple this week after giving them 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbours were grateful for the eviction – they said their lives were a hell on earth.
One of the neighbours says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived with them for 20 years, and the whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
This morning we could not sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we are not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were regularly summoned.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown into the wild walls of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It's a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his/her own and his/her family's behaviour, because eviction is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to be seen in the neighbourhood.
I am grateful to my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and the members of the community who took part in the work and offered boldly to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms after eviction
Housing workers must now clean up the piles of waste surrounding the house.
In 2014, the police raided the apartment and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales and other supplies, as well as £1 700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for having been found guilty of possession of a class B drug in order to sell it.
He claimed that the money was for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been told to move into a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were wasted with graffiti.
The police say they are calling for eviction of tenants who violate the rules of rental agreements.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police say this eviction is a clear warning for tenants who are constantly defiing the rules.
This is a clear message for those who think they can behave the way they want without charge, as well as for those who suffer from this kind of behaviour," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behaviour, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach-thin army jet scares tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed to an astonishingly low level.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not pose a threat to safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
The dramatic images show how the military aircraft comes close to touch with tourists sunbathing on the sandy beach in Aveiro, Northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers rose on their feet, appreciably appreciative of the rumble of jet engines that began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the vacationers who filmed the dramatic flyby and posted the videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice at a very low altitude, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a startling low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels, which meant that the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal, because the smoke from nearby fires hampered visibility, but according to the air force, this did not threaten the safety of anyone.
Forest fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that due to the poor visibility of heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Excluding the first half of the year results better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) made a better result than planned in January - June of 3.4 million euros.
Exote's result was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has enabled the dismantling of institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Exote aims to shorten the action queues.
Exote covers the deficit that was previously created with the surplus.
The excess of it may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Government of Exote will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Jaegers Swear Military Oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military cetaceans of the Border and Coast Guard School were held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Jaeger Course was held in the garrison's sports field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special Border Jagers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border jager.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special Border Jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the war-time frontier forces were present at the veteran meeting in connection with the cetacean.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
A few minutes ahead of the bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has had an RTA, i.e. a crime intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible to the outside.
The Häme Police Department has a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is run by a superintendent located in Lahti.
The Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Directors in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian person dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian fashion.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the other police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would less and less often leave the straws in the mires only when they receive an alert.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, day-to-day police operations are targeted where they are most needed.
Along with the reform of the police administration, a crime intelligence centre, its three national units and its own crime intelligence unit were established in the country.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, leads the operations nationally.
PTR units, as their name suggests, work with the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in shared areas according to the police departments, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Enquiry extends beyond your own territory
While the individual police is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department.
The inquiry also extends beyond the boundaries of your own institution, because this is what crime does.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, an alert function database and observations to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of working.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
On the basis of the method of action, a certain image is formed of the author.
Serialization can be done either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which of the police has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not move up the collars in the city, but their work is not entirely public either.
The methods used by both individuals and criminals are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus preventing crime prevention attempts by the police.
The police will publicly report on the methods if they are anticipated to pose a threat.
For example, in the early summer, such a case was reported as a way of marking empty dwellings used in apartment break-ins.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the outer door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really travelling.
The pre-trial material is public at least to the parties.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest ones order the minutes of the district court, which can show, for example, that fingerprints have been found in the place.
The next time the thieves go hand in hand with gloves.
For the case, Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police, Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finnish Police, Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station, and Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collects and analyses information that is used to plan practical activities.
Against the background of a decrease in labour and financial numbers.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage ORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation collects information from outside the own institution and Finland’s borders.
A London schoolgirl who joined the Isis was killed in Syria
According to the news, one in three British schoolchildren who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
The lawyer Tasname Akunjee says that the girl's family heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, which is the base of ISIS in Syria, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a testament so that people will understand that this is a real risk when they go to a war zone - and that makes people give up their decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East London school girls, boarded a plane flying to Turkey and continued by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected
Secretary of the Senate Harry Reid says he is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Merrick Garland as Supreme Court Judge if she is elected President.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since he was appointed by Barack Obama in March.
According to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, the next president will elect a person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
In a teleconference on Thursday, Reid said he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with a great deal of certainty".
Reid's spokesperson later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the head of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid says that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the "commandants" and "facilitators" of the presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
According to Treats, naked calendars belong equally well to women and men
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s-style calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli.
Instead of celebrity naked models, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, said earlier this year that his naked magazine was different from the old school Playboy magazines, because he said, "Playboy is for men.
I do this for women."
Apparently he thinks the same about the calendar.
We need to bring back the timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, can easily enjoy and be inspired by these images of the female body," says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.
You can upload your photos online or take part in open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
The charm of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write your angry objection to the commentary under the name NotAll LonelyMiddle-agedMen, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov, behind the much-spoken new arrival of vinyl records is not a boom for the millennial generation, when the millennials want to feel in their hands a physical object, but rather a nostalgia for the middle age.
The age of a person who recently purchased a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, age groups 18 to 24 are the least likely buyers.
It’s not just a hobbyist’s desire to collect records, it’s an emotional one: older vinyl record buyers are a little more likely to hide their emotions (56% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But is YouGov’s results correct?
If this blog were a televised news broadcast, the camera would follow me as I walk along the bustling Soho Street, wearing a non-jewelry grey jacket. I would make a lively gesture, bend my hand into a cup, and say something traditional like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and roughness as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I look very close to visiting men in these shops and try to evaluate their age and character.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from the Sister Ray movement (as customers at that time two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records movement (as customers at that time eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends extra time exploring the supply of shops.
I ask if he is a collector.
I think I am," he says.
I have about 3000 to 4000 records.
These plates fill his living room wall, as you can see from the picture. (Stuart sent me the picture by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and buy again things that he had had to sell as a young person and without money.
I got a lot of the stuff from the late 60s and early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them,” he says.
He agrees that vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit into the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new stream of people affected by media hype, who have heard about the re-entry of vinyl records and now feel compelled to buy back their old records.
On the basis of the discussions I had had, in general, people had abandoned their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain the boom of a certain age of vinyl wakefulness.
What about the alleged emotional meaning of the audio discs?
In just a few seconds you will realize in a movement like Phonica that they provide a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly upset by the contactless payment system.
The digital world may be astonished by some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar disc cases means persistence and reminds us of the lucky days of adolescence.
I think it sometimes fills a gap or acquires tangible assets for some kind of consolation," says Wez.
This is how I see it as a collector myself, and I think so are so many others.
It’s an easy way to get your thoughts elsewhere.”
We're like social workers!" he said behind the stack of Wez's co-workers.
An ICM poll in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought a vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
Opinion poll also reported that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of vinyl record buyers do not have their own record player at all.
At this point in the news, I would probably show a serious face while browsing the stacked bossa nova collections.
The re-enactment of vinyl records is also accompanied by the "pocket effect" observed by Jonny, 42, of the Sounds of the Universe movement (currently three middle-aged men as customers).
A customer recently came into circulation and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
The proportion of such customers is not high, but they are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don’t have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers, who are just starting out with a hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Foppi, where I will come next. The store has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl records.
Customers include 70-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is gratifying, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of the roaring jazz on the speakers, Wild Beasts’ newest sex-drinking synthesizer pop.
None of the clients look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to find a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and watching a variety of discounted discs.
He is watching rather than shopping.
He says that his income is small, so it is not possible for him to collect records.
They cost a lot.
The music is easy to listen to from the computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is ...," he let go of the lovely sigh and continues:
I can't explain, they're so unique.
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a group of teenage girls who think they are squeezing jeans shorts, but who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mix of contemporary music and classics, central plates for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an element of interior design and some of them are so high that they cannot even be reached.
They are pure "art vinyl" interiors.
But given that all the means to get attention to these discs may mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population group, which is more likely to have more time and money than most, is also the group that spends the most money on luxury items such as vinyl records.
Although my research shows that YouGov’s results are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
They certainly won’t spend their Thursday mornings delving into Berwick Street’s record stores, browsing the records, and avoiding a 30-year-old TV host who looks frighteningly and looks at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri (ice shark) is the longest living vertebrate – video report
According to scientists, the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to the shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the age of the oldest ice shark was 272–512 years in the study.
French court rejects application for demerger of jungle camp shops
The French court has rejected an application from the Calais authorities to require dozens of temporary shops and restaurants to be demolished in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities made allegations that the state should be allowed to break up the 72 temporary shops set up in the refugee camp. The shops sell different kinds of goods to the refugee camp residents from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts. Temporary restaurants can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the Calais prefecture authorities, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy, and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid teams told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, as the free meals provided by the government-backed organization and others are not enough for the ever-growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Calais prefect to be "fully understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the food stores, cafés and restaurants in the camp are of much greater importance than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
They offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids café in the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice for the camp’s hundreds of unaccompanied minors who are most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed an address for a children's café.
According to a letter to the Guardian, its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old".
On Friday, two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated that after a sharp increase in the number of visitors in the summer, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record number of more than 9 000 people.
Food prices in Finland fall significantly faster than the EU average
In Finland, food prices fall sharply to the delight of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price in EU countries has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen most in those EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
Only in the UK, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is presented in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager at Statistics Finland, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then there was a turn, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now set by Russia’s bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the producer prices of agricultural products have decreased.
Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as an impressive advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not a low-cost food destination, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland with a wage level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the comparator countries had the same VAT percentage, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland with the same level of wages.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven per cent in the comparison countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finnish ones.
If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average of the EU countries and the price competition must continue,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations with VAT percentage are indicative.
School is no longer exactly the same
Those returning to school may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline according to which all Finnish schools operate.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan outlines the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
For example, the teaching of fiction will be abandoned, and instead the schools will start to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies start at the fourth.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of the students.
It used to be thought that the teacher teaches students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate shark found - an ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even the known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It can then live for another 250 years, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebral column in the world today.
In the animal world, it is only passed by a clam whose oldest known individual is dated to 507 years of age.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to follow-up only about one centimetre a year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females trapped in fishermen's gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon timing of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters of amazon, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that the ice shark females reach sexual maturity only more than four metres long, the researchers calculated that they are at that point at about 150 years of age.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann to fire nearly 300 - sellers are not reduced
Almost 300 employees are laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
The cooperation companies in the company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant," says Stockmann in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers of department stores will not be reduced in order to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, about 80 employees of the support services will be offered new jobs as a seller.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3 000 employees.
At the time of their start, it was estimated that there would be around 380 employees.
The aim of the reduction is to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which will be implemented in the coming year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
This is due to Stockmann’s difficulties in making the department store trade profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the department store still makes a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, the Acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen says in the press release.
The second quarter profit improvement was due in particular to the good success of the Lindex clothing chain.
The chain achieved the best second quarter turnover and results ever.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the operating result of the entire Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist at HS.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but there will be a lot of rain in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20°C throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees will remain.
Kenyan athletics team shakes doping scandal - strange explanation for coach's rapture
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah performed as a team athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform was the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample as a Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials visited the Anzrah authorities.
Anzrah was sent home because he "had committed a crime against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept this kind of behaviour," the chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, Kip Kei, said, roaring the news agency Reuters.
Athletics at the Olympics will start on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year on the way and is ahead of Rio's top picks.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah traveled with an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being revealed," the source said.
Where is everyone?
Rio athletics stadium rubberizes its emptiness
Where is everyone?
Not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to watch athletics.
On Friday in Rio, the battle for athletics medals began, but the world's top performers were able to show off their skills to an empty audience.
On Friday, Rio announced that only 58% of the first-day morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets had been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium swelled with cheery people.
The finals tickets are sold out in Rio too.
The demise of the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the spectators of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70% full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, with only about 30 percent of the grandstand for 12 000 people.
Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not able to complete the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, spokesperson for the event organisers, said that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though they cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
Volunteers and military personnel at the London Olympics were allowed to sit in empty spaces, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, as organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren for lesser-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places at Rio Stadium in the morning.
Not even beach volleyball on the sand of Copacaba has interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were plenty of people in the galleries.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
The foundation, founded last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, corporate and entities can redeem the ownership rights to land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is divided into virtual blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to have a right of ownership for a fee.
The holder is entitled to veto its 187 square metre block, which means that approval is not required for each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
Acquiring a right of possession is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Leviakangas, who acquired the right of possession for his company.
The acquirer of the right of administration receives precise location information from the block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of the persons acquiring the right holders are shown on the same map where the block data of the land area can be found.
Leviakangas sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the foundation’s operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation will act in some way unbiased or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltaja project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of holder rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves are the worst in big cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves are the worst hit by large cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in the other nine major cities.
Based on the bicycle theft reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat explained how many bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen per thousand inhabitants in the ten largest cities in January-August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti reached the top.
According to police reports, four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants took place.
In Espoo and Kouvola, the police reported only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
That's the big difference.
In other cities, there are twice the number of thefts relative to the number of inhabitants," says Police Inspector Tommi Reen.
The police in Turku are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
The prevalence of theft can be affected by how much people move around the city on wheels and how many wheels there are at all,” says Teemu Äikäs, Senior Adviser at the University of Helsinki.
Tommi Reen, the police administration, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The amount of bicycle theft goes largely according to what are the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense city centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
Espoo, for example, is a very different type of city, where urban centres are at a distance from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport,” says Reen.
In the whole of Finland, there have been slightly fewer bicycle thefts in January-August than in the same period last year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police become aware of just over 20 000 bicycle thefts every year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and only about 4 000 bikes a year in Helsinki.
They are large quantities," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report theft of bicycles, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are reported.
A typical bicycle theft is one in which the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in the blood.
Cases can also be found in connection with another investigation, when, for example, in a drug case, stolen wheels can be found in the apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from shopping centres’ bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja is the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, via the internet.
They remain in the domestic market.
At least it has not been known to the police that stolen bikes would go abroad a lot," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bicycles are ordinary Finns.
Some people will probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some of them may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a hidden offence or violation.
Alarm bells should ring if a well-functioning bike is sold at a clear price,” Reen says.
Senior Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the Kallio library in Helsinki for the entire working day.
He has had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen," says the elk. "Never taken, there has been a good monk."
Perhaps this is not so attractive to thieves, there may not be any hipster value here," says Helsinki-based Hirvi.
Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike was squeezing against the kiosk wall, but usually Valve locks its bike in a fixed frame, such as a bike rack.
It will take a lot of thought, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki who says about his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
All the time I hear from my friends that the wheels have been taken away.
Mostly bad bikes, such a sloppy Jopo.
A bicycle was stolen from the valve itself from the courtyard of the housing company a year ago.
However, the bike had not been locked, so Valve was waiting for it to be seized.
Are you under 15 years of age responsible for your crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-to-peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal responsibility.
The peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender himself may join the jury to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may include a family letter explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used side by side.
Everyone steers the young person’s actions in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined by the first mistake,” says Laitio.
The peer jury is modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person does not face an adult panel after the first crime, but reflects on what happened about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service design agency that followed the experiment, Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, says that this was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
The first crimes of children under 15 years of age in particular may not have been dealt with at all before.
It has been a message that you will continue along the path of your choice," says Lovio.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki Youth of Immigrants project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to all those who need them, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding the Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the US newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, an open letter is addressed to the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be channelled to the Congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his indifference, incompetence and record-breaking disfavor, threaten to bring an avalanche to the democrats in these elections," the letter says, according to Politico.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in a Trump ornamental anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as the chances of Trump winning the presidential election are reduced day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a prominent anti-Trump Republican.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of acts by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief for US families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton explained the details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am looking for a president to make the US economy go well for everyone.
Donald Trump is striving for a president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by the tax increases of the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a hand-stretch for American workers who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paid jobs since World War II.
We are a building nation, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to facilitate the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, however, he sounded like Sanders, emphasizing that the rich should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it will have to pay the tax at source,” Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
As [President], I am opposed to any trade agreement that works against workers or wages," Clinton said.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise the economic programme announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "favouring only such millionaires".
Trump's proposed rebate on corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's loophole".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small entrepreneur.
He reminded listeners of small businessmen whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and clothes that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are Rio’s viewing figures: The races have not glued Finnish to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear as sharp mountain peaks in TV viewing statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a huge number of viewers.
At one time, 12 per cent of the population have been glued to the screens: Tuesday evening swimming followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison, the European Championships in athletics one month ago attracted almost 800 000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Championships in football attracted well over another million.
So far, the Olympic sports have been most interested in Sunday evening cycling and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, head of sports, is pleased with the number of viewers, and reminds that for the first time at the Rio Games, viewers are divided into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns are also watching the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the number of TV viewers who choose the Olympics at all.
On the television side, viewers are also distributed to TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports games for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When broadcast 24 hours a day, and there are viewers from 20 000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts come at night in Finland.
Another reason for the dilute interest - if someone now considers it dilute - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the first races, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as are other Finnish sports of interest: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, the viewing figures explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the competition in the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150 000 times.
I’d bet we’re already around 200 000 downloads.
We will only get the viewing figures for the network later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
There are updated versions of the applications that should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics are more visible on Yle’s channels and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be followed from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio, Yle Speech broadcasts the races every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last that can only be followed through Yle channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 meters at Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technology diving instructor Matti Kanela found a printout of about 20 square meters on Ristiselkä, the bottom of which was 104 meters deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried to strengthen the observation by echo sounding.
The method may not find a small recess of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Over 80 meters to Lake Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
There may well be unknown depths," Kantela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In this sense, your Son will not be among the ten deepest ones and Suvasvesi will still be farther from the top.
Correction 12 August at 14.29: Corrected the last paragraph where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Ihalainen from the tax sector: Taxation of pensioners continues to be tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that maladministration came up under parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised equality with employees.
This is not included in the government proposal.
In our opinion, that should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be followed after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received income reductions that eased taxation.
The matter was heated in Parliament by opposition representatives who embellished the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (Co.) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Finance Minister Petteri Orpo on tax cuts is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, as salaries will not be raised next year.
He says that a tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä’s (central) and Orpo’s messages on the desire to honour the competitive agreement reached with difficulty.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done with the help of labour market organisations, so it should not be misled by questioning.
This is necessary because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people’s own faith in the future.
Prolonged unemployment in the barn
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was about 17 000 more than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s target of raising employment to 72 per cent will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of protracted unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No known Finnish victims in Thai attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and in Finland last night.
The Embassy calls on Finns in the country to pay attention and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is advisable to follow the embassy’s instructions with caution,” Westphalen says.
Very little Finnish in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there is currently very little Finnish in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand takes place at the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to find out more about the situation in the city, especially in Hua Hin.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalia says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalia, there is still no information on the perpetrator of the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thai divided society and the recent referendum on the constitution of the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who reportedly objected to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is a ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It is a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalia says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
The traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks would affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism is also excluded, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand over the past 24 hours, with 11 bombs exploded across the country, such as in tourist-popular Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in the tourist destination of Finland, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require any fatalities.
Two of the bombs exploded in a newspaper in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was wounded.
According to local authorities, four bombs have exploded in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one person was killed in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village and town of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
It is also known to many tourists as it leads to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayt Chan-O-Cha, leader of the military junta in Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not encourage people to panic any more," he told reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators had intended to destroy the country's tourism, as all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finns in the country to pay attention and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is advisable to follow the embassy’s instructions with caution,” Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
So far very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
Last night's attack on Hua Hin has given us a bit more information.
It killed a local woman and injured more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the second attack of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded as an attraction near a well-known bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found one more bomb.
According to the governor of the province, the suicide bomb in Surat was hidden in a flower bed.
An employee of the municipality died in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
The police chief, interviewed by CNN, said that two bombs were also used in the attack on the city, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles wins women's four-game
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60.098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia with the third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for scaffolding championships in Rio competitions on the pavement, jumping and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to an extent in recent years.
He had eight personal world championships for the last three years.
He has won the four-game and permanence championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last year and the year before.
In the US team, Biles has won two world championships.
The fainter World Cup medals have a jump and boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "The attack has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombing on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I don’t think this will result in anything more marvellous, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies near Thailand.
There is always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a avian influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If even these past ones have not expelled tourists, then this is hardly the case.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
The villa heard about the attack from its own employee.
The employee called around 9 a.m. for local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
The villa says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put because of the Queen's birthday, says Huovila and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere was calm and the movements on the main street were allowed to open around 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o'clock in the day, the traffic in Thailand was normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the impact site, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the impact site.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmitie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men with signs hidden in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately caught.
Another left, but a man was later found in the woods with a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to the motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the hints.
Director of Research on Russia’s leadership changes: Clear Exclusion
On Friday, the highest-ranking change of leadership took place in Russia, when President Vladimir Putin dismissed the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino from Estonia.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second man.
The brook says that the reason for Ivanov's separation may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been caught up with other leaders or messed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, an insider of Putin, will take over special duties in environmental and transport matters.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other positions and proposed to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in the station.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but the president rose to Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin changes his immediate family to a younger age.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when withdrawing from Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarbulus so that we would not target them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbiji Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarbulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to Isis.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected earlier news at 19:30: Previously, we misreported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually the Isis fighters abducted civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document publicity policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participants in the Ministry of the Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the minister’s calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Director of Communications of the Ministry says to STT that the Ministry has noticed a need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time under the ranks.
In the early part of the season, he broke his hind legs and had to skip the Jamaican Olympic Qualifiers.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I have practised well and that is the key," Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included little-dressed samba dancers and fan-turned journalists.
Around Porina Bolt, it is underlined that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt's last loss at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200-meter initials by 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose exercise attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and the competition's self-confidence, despite the final celebration of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career point with a watch.
The world records of 9.58 metres and 19.19 metres in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and a 19-second record, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
At 100, Bolt's biggest challenge is the 2004 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin of Athens.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundredth second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost in the finals of a prestigious competition if he has just made his way.
In Daegu, the 2011 World Cup final was left unrun by Bolt for cheating.
Bolt fills up in just over 30 weeks.
He is an old man of the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final goalline for his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I am older and this is more difficult.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio disclosures: two athletes suspected of doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi found traces of banned substances in a doping sample.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
He finished fourth in the women's 100-metre butterfly swim in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide could have been found in the sample given by Xinyi on Sunday.
Other suspicions of doping have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female fluid runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping test with signs of an epo-hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has moved from Rio to the home of an athletic coach due to doping.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) reported that a Kenyan coach had performed as an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping test on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan running coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre running Ferguson Rotich race pass.
Phelps won't stop anything - historic gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, U.S. Michael Phelps, swims in a 200-meter mess with his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive race of the same sport.
Phelps won 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was second in a mix before Chinese Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun," BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
Helen Skelton’s (right) Monday story is one of the most read on Iltalehti’s website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not stress much if there is a little noise in the social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress with at least enough exposure - at least for the eyes of many conservative British spectators.
However, there are no back steps.
It’s important to look good, and the little ones are just a fun thing.
Skelton is sure to want to startle and perhaps even startle, but he emphasizes that he does not want to play the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We are watching sports here, and the focus must be on sports.
It should not matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the upheaval has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that focuses on how hard these swimmers do their job and how much sacrifice they make is ok for me, Skelton grins.
Do you know what?
It's a tumult from nothing if it comes from a (host) dress.
I am a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio Police made two arrests for suspected terrorism
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety control of the games.
At the same time, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects were Brazilians.
According to G1, people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were already arrested by the police in July.
The detainees are believed to have links with the Islamic extremist organisation.
The detainees had reportedly incited violence on social media.
Among other things, messages to encourage violence were posted on the popular WhatsApp service.
85 000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.

Argentine lady banging Petäjä-Siren - Finnish reflection on protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren experienced hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady banged Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the start of the day of women's surfing.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away," Joakim Wilenius, Finland's chief coach, said.
The athlete considered protesting for a long time.
It was not worth it, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finns hung on their board until the last day because they didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
With the accident, Finland remained in 27th place.
In total, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in London is the eighth.
With regard to the tip, the crash did not have much effect.
Friday is an important day when we are competing for departures 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life lengthens.
Sometimes, things that a person cannot influence themselves can bring him or her additional years.
These include a tendency to middle body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't always have to throw yourself in - just applying for a milk can is enough.
The secret of longevity has been investigated through a variety of studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre results of the study.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "decreased risk of death", especially in neurological or cardiovascular diseases.
Studies on alcohol suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can prolong a person’s life by up to six years, a study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases in the rest of the human body.
A study in Norway looked at how laughing affected a person’s life span.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54 000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test.
Sex, when it is taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, simply having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of his or her life, he or she should also have an orgasm.
Of course, exercise will bring additional years, it is not a denial.
However, reaching a long life does not require absolute saltiness.
A study from the University of Oxford found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it’s an athlete who has reached the Olympic medals or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live beyond the usual bunnies.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring additional years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which, on the other hand, makes it possible, for example, to seek recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over the age of 65 found that a person shopping every day was more likely to be older than a person shopping less often.
This is due to the fact that turning around in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring about death.
So, count your credit card in your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driving driver derailed into a truck
A serious truck and passenger car crash took place on Friday evening in Koske, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place at Koskentie and Sorvastontie in mid-Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that had arrived had drifted into the lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck remained in its lane, but burned.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car went into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972, who carried a passenger car, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to the Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of drunken driving.
Mail sent loose candies to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket’s selection of loose candies, because the mail had delivered part of the load accidentally to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was on Thursday buying loose candies from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose sweets, because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We will receive more when Posti receives the delivery of the load!
If there is no congestion in lawn mowing, the sign reads.
The trader’s foxy sign relates to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
Lawn mowing is available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with surprise.
Representatives of the media have been calling all the time, and the attention this raises is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia’s update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to grab her own favourites in a bag of loose candies, even though a few of them were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the transport services business of Posti Corporation, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The reason for this is that three of the five stages were diverted yesterday to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we did not go on to do part-delivery (Salo) three more, but we only took five stages today," Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
The first news item on this issue is the Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not indignant with the sign because she found all her favourite loose candies in the selection.
30 kg lighter Lotta Backlund published a picture of her change
The comedian producer has slendered dozens of kilograms since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of life change.
Lotta shared a couple of photos on Instagram on Friday.

Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss contract in 2009.
He has undergone a total lifestyle change and has slowly lost 30 kilograms.
On Friday, Backlund published a couple of photos of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
The Backlund before and after pair of pictures has collected several commendable comments from dieters.
You are wonderful.
We are on the same journey, motivation is hard!
Piia Korinen, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your photos when you travel the same way, another says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Let's Do it Now project.
At that time, he told the newspaper that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was ten kilograms away.
During the three-month fitness course, the kilos eventually dropped to five.
Family wishes of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered for police dog work instead of flowers and addresses.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the family’s wish for donations to the benefit of police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoon Veterinarian Centre and also completed his/her practical training there.
The veterinary clinic remembers with words that touch a woman.
Cheerful, smart, humorous and unafraid of work.
Dear friend.
We still cannot fully understand that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donations go to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own yard in the village of Koskenkylä in Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbours have said to the Evening newspaper that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a cock.
The 27-year-old man suspected of the murder did not know the woman and they had no contact with each other.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was injured in the arrest.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court handed down a judgment to Posti in breach of the Equality Act
Posti was not entitled to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise himself with the leased employee, the District Court of Kanta-Häme estimated in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the salary of the lecturer, which corresponded to the share of the induction throughout the day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the Union for Postal and Logistics PAU’s decision on the prohibition of induction.
During last year’s November postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees did not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who violated the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Ps.) in their reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in his letter, the Association of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression to Turkey.
Putin sacked the head of his administration - the Estonian-backed Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
The Soviet communist leader Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will replace him.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
Persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax says.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's tight-knit inner circle, will be assigned to special tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to the Kremlin's press release.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other positions and proposed that persecution be replaced, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB spying.
Many considered Ivanov to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but the president rose to the rank of Dmitry Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin's re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU gets banned - not seen in Premier League opening
The world record for football transfers is not seen in the field when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed in England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition of Paul Pogba is sidelined by a ban when ManU opens its league on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said on Friday.
According to British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million for Pogba to the Italian club Juventus.
However, the English Football Federation (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was left out of Juventus.
He received two warnings at last season's Italian Cup and will be banned from playing a single game.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, madness is a virtue
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival’s position as an internationally acclaimed event, which is starred by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival’s event area is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just have a main stage and a beer tent,” says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind the success is: what kind of event would the creators themselves want to go to?
In event production, it is quite different to think so.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors to 70 000 last year by 5 000 people.
This year, the festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because the activities must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled by huge lanes.
That is not what we want.
During 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been expanded so that there are 130 performers, art installations, as well as numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area decorated with artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage performances, the venue this year is a tent for 15 000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I’m a bit crazy, but at the same time we’ve been able to keep Flow’s spirit.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even big visions are practically possible today.
In the early 2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of around EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "creatic things" like the construction of the 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not deliberately profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit into Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan base in his genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked, because this is probably the last time we will see her at a gig in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
Not just what is played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and she has been doing damn good gigs in recent years.
Thai tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and exploded with the help of mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were blown up while tourists started leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, according to police representative Samoer Yoosumran, CNN.
Since 1989, the protector of wild animals in Asia, Edwin Wiek, has referred to the much-discussed image of the attacks.
If you don’t see the tv here, you can see it here.
At least 11 people injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The people ran up against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It took place on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time exploded with two bombs in the city.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which is also popular in Finland.
No one is reportedly dead.
At the same time, another double-bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bombings, who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organisations that traffic in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby troops will first go into battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are only ordered to fight after several months of taking the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Chief of Training of the Finnish Defence Forces, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, who serves 5.5 months in a military situation, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible to fight.
According to the training manager, first, reserve personnel are assigned to the service.
No conscripts or reservists are ordered to perform a task that has not received the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training conscripts in the units of immediate preparedness as of next year.
If necessary, the units can be used for military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola gets huge compensation for a homestay
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house was EUR 330 000.
However, after the transaction, the house revealed a serious moisture problem, which caused a dangerous microbial plantation for health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in a demolished condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal issued a judgment in the case on Wednesday.
It maintained the judgment of the District Court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the costs of the couple’s trial and investigation.
The court moderated the price reduction a little, because the buyers had already been aware of the need to repair the apartment when the purchase was made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the construction errors that had occurred were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
Tola is looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a good home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had come to the conclusion that the building had been renovated and in good condition, and that there was no harm to the matters mentioned in the condition inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and flaws of ventilation and the fact that the control of rain and melting water flowing along the rock surface is not sufficient.
However, the discussions did not indicate that this was in any way a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that rainwater from the rock might have to be controlled a little over a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
In the inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013, the building found microbial vegetation, which according to witnesses were caused by both rainwater on the rock and soil moisture that had risen capillary.
On the west side of the house, it was estimated by the inspector that air contaminated with microbes could also enter the interior of the building via the veranda.
Moulds or yeasts above the limit values that enable a health risk were found in brush samples in the utility room, in the basement staircase, in the window marker in the living room and in the washroom in the basement.
The terraces were built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision to amend the apartment in violation of the permit prior to the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, mould problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the transaction, assume that the building was suitable for living as it was and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that there was no special reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their obligation to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children to the Nazis - also Finnish in the register
In a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes about the total number of 218 500 women who wanted to marry SS men stored in the National Archive of Microfilms in Maryland, USA.
Most of the women are Germans, but there are also Americans, Frenchmen, Dutchmen and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become a Nazi bride.
Documents and registration cards come from a breed agency in Nazi Germany.
The Finnish Race Agency served under the SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children before being examined by an SS doctor.
The same goes for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were carried out on women to investigate the matter.
The Finnish Racial Agency examined women’s backgrounds, for example, by studying church books.
The aim was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breed agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Finnish Racial Agency wanted guarantees that the women were "child-loving", "sparing", and "good national socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The article does not tell you what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that every SS man should have four children, either inside or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, according to the website of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The honorary cross of the German mother was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, according to the museum's website.
Petäjä-Sire's sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the Finnjolls’ day at the first departure at the Rio Olympics, but remained at the top of the team at the second departure of the day.
Nirkko was 8th in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day departures at positions 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470s, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren left 23 at the start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are number 19.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna recorded a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so caught up”
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has made the cruise ship’s bartender king of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dance stages and festivals, is still on the verge of turning upside down and he is currently in a rush.
Jari Sillanpää, a book about the life of a favourite singer by Mari Koppinen, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career took off in a total take-off when he won the crown of the tango king on the Seinäjokin Tango market in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen arranged in a slightly different format.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us, however, that the recording of the song did not go as planned: Sillanpää sang on the tape with a terrible hangover and just after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so caught up!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that has become a huge hit would not immediately guess that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I was not physically at my best, the imprint was still good.
I learned that it is not always necessary to claim the perfect and the highest.
Another coincidence related to the man's songs, which is reported in the book, took place almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time and the case ended up in the text of the song "You deserve gold", which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true, it was written on the basis of news from 7 days.
In the newspaper's news, Jari's and ex-love's separation was explained as the reason for Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but according to Jari, it was a complete bunny and was not correct.
According to the book, Jari played to the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the polling week's polls predict the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their view of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid," flew into a scrap box in the UK's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides the profession with answers to the Brexit disaster.
The typical answer is that economists were not listened to because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the reasons economists explain is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still imagine that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it’s out of the UK.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing, as it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were christised by the fairness of the BBC, which allowed just as much room for a couple of percent of economists representing the EU’s withdrawal as for an overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in explaining what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, LSE and other economic power combinations think of the consequences of the breakup.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with which voters do not feel that there are common interests.
Academics like economists in big cities would have remained in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants will take your job, immigrants will congest your hospital, immigrants will take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every café has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would a British doctor’s appointment be if they didn’t exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they got rid of them?
Foreigners live in each municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they disappeared?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepared for Brexit in Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
In Aberdeen, he said, early preparations were made for Brexit by drawing up plans for A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the victory of the EU-based camp, began to be prepared a few weeks before the vote, in case the result would be a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We started to grow cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," says Vanhanen of Aberdeen's only open daily quote of the real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The value of the fund at that time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds of the UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or even below 10%.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trade
When the EU-based camp won, Europe got confused.
However, the two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, they sprang up the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund had to close its doors one after the other.
Aberdeen’s situation was good because of the cash raised, but it also had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worth taking the money out in a panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it won’t be worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down the situation, and most withdrew the notification.
Since then, the market has been fairly stable, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks,” Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen’s continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonably attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closing of real estate fund transactions received too much attention.
The open funds affected by the closures account for about 4% of UK real estate.
Aberdeen closed for six days and sold out less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may hold its funds until 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been razed down, but the situation does not seem to be "worse" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought some real estate investors even new opportunities, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market in relation to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought minuses to the London real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning the situation did not seem very good.
But at 4 a.m., when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate investment manager of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That was the power word.
I realized that this is now going to Plan B’s side,” Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
The City of London was already fully alive in the early hours of the morning.
The TV screens, which were normally silent in the office, were telling the news, and the usually loud crowd was completely silent as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed red only.
It was the kind of morning you would never have thought you would live, says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in the UK, completed two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. on Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, which is why the situation was calm in a way," Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote started a correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate severe declines in the UK property market, especially in London.
London's office space was expected to have a minus of up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of UK real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after the other.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty is still raging in the air.
It does not appear to have been on the face of Vanhanen this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about what will happen with Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the London real estate market has already been obtained.
The real estate service company CBRE’s data on price development cover about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the office buildings of the City of London, the minus was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and there have been worse figures for only five months,” Vanhanen says.
All equally large falls hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
Olden thinks that the comparison is not quite apt, because it is now a home-grown crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like those of the past, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There is also funding normally available.
The repair could have been in front of you anyway.
In fact, the correction of prices is no wonder to him - one could have been in front of him without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other world’s number one cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City, and especially the offices, are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
So the fall started really high.
London’s prices have been upwards for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is becoming globalized, says Vanhanen.
The Middle East and Asia have become new players in the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, the prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new properties.
On top of this, the loan has been easily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the debt lever has now been used clearly less than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the rise in prices levelled off last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some twist to be expected, and now it came.
What to do from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to judge much for the future, but says that there will hardly be a surge.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or flat front.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And still he is an optimist who believes that the pits can be overcome by work.
If you are prepared for the risks well, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim.
If there is a decentralisation, the risks are also decentralised,” says Vanhanen.
S Group begins to register shopping data more accurately than before
S Group knows what you are eating, because today the trading group announced that it was starting to collect even more detailed information about its regular customers’ purchases.
So far, when information has been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin to collect it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
S Group comes after Kesko here, as the information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used subject to authorisation for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group registration change.
Kesko already categorizes its loyal customers according to food purchases alone into ten groups.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchasing information is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not currently planning to do so.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty program, which can be joined in the selection houses, Siwa and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product or product-level information, we will stick to the total amount of the receipt.
In other words, we know in which store the purchases were made and on which day and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the same level as the K-Group or the S-Group,” says Anu Ora, Commercial Director.
According to him, the loyalty program will be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
At first an experiment
SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal data and address data, basic data also included occupation, education, form of residence, and the years of birth and previous personal data of children.
Persons belonging to the same household and their role are also registered.
The purchase date and time, place, the total amount of purchases and payment method are saved from the S-Emotion Card purchase.
In addition, the S-bonus partners’ information has been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Home Terras and ABC chains, data is currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Activities.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored at the checkouts in any case, whether they want it or not.
A willing person can check his/her deposited data on the S Group website.
For example, the cash registers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is the latest dog confirmation from Customs - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever’s kitten sneezes vigorously at five boxes placed in the same row at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila to play with his favourite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of powdered gas-scented sockets was revealed.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the dog Heila.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be located at Helsinki Airport next year.
If needed, the duties of Heila and Suntio may also be taken to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs and, after the attacks, supervision has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and an explosive dog for Customs’ duties are postal deliveries through Helsinki Airport.
With the increase in internet sales, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport every year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 finds related to weapons, parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine registered luggage and postal items.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila-puppy training is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio will also train with Heila at the police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to be chosen for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is in contact with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at the home of Suntio, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing can be done without Heila at home, says Suntio.
The subtle orders go to Heila from the one-off box.
The cameraman of the evening messages loses the cover of the microphone for a quick dog, but Heila returns the cover that looks like a soft toy right away from the command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
Level tests are still ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron a dog wearing work vests, says Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately 60000-70000 euros per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active working hours only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a fierce competition for working dogs in Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees were applied for as the owner of Heila.
Onni was hit by Suntio, who has not had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and supervision duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
The Olympic gold of less than one million inhabitants of Fiji in rugby is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was resolved.
The holiday is held the day after the team returns home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in the capital Suvalla, where a screen had been erected on the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage," said Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish lifter fainted after a ferocious performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one has been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos and 145 kilos from the rapture.
His combined result was 320 kg.
Tokola tried to push 175 kilos at the last, as well as each other.
At the third company, weights rose accompanied by fierce roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lifting.
The joy of the Finnish lifter was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Football Club, which plays in the men’s football league, has concluded a lasting agreement with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player for our team who has the power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
Together with more than ten players, we went through more than 50 players from all over the world.
Little by little, the crowd started to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa," RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinn's Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi residents will meet the Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goal king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Voluptuous Modern Family star shrugged again: teenage star shorts reveal almost everything
As a friendly Alex Dunphy of the Modern Family comedy series, Ariel Winter reintroduces her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also this backside.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour to become much bolder.
The star has been posing on social media in very few photos and taking numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very tight outfits.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has also recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If the image does not appear, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
In this case, Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television for almost his entire life and grew up in the age of the Kardashians.
He’s learned that the more you look at the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood,” says Palmer to Fox News, adding that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has infuriated some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years’ time, when the downhill is already so hard,” says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her not to care about criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, a young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the Northern Lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese tourists to start Northern Lights trips already in the early autumn," Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
The northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly linked to heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a good demand for winter Northern Lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and continues well into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision a double fairy tale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 who live in the city and dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, for example, by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers at Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more clear and unique sights in Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights have enormous potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown significantly more than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting as a target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain had to settle for silver in the rugby-7 race when Fiji's championship team won gold
The UK's impressive success in the seven-player rugby race was devastatingly disrupted when Fiji won it on Thursday in the Rio Deodoro Stadium final in the numbers 43–7.
Fiji gave the masters training in ball handling, transfers, side-diversions, support games, running lines and brutal power, winning gold – if the country was the first Olympic medal in all its history.
The defeat meant silver, which was a little bit more lenient comfort for Britain, as it was the third silver of the country on the same day, and they can be proud of their success as an Olympic sport at the first-ever rugby-7 tournament in which the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The South African Boxes victory in the 7–5 semifinals earlier that day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, the Fiji team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-member team had been in full force.
Great Britain may be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will be given a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, former England rugby team coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been quite great for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all games in Ryan's training at the Adelaide Sevens.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Loss hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji started off excellently and showed off his tackle skills to the UK as if for fun.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had crashed into a group of moving buses, and the World Cup rose to a 5-0 lead when Oceana Kolinsau made a plunge into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored a second goal on the right side of the goal kick.
Situation 12–0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning tackle prevented the staggering Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it did not slow down Fiji's progress.
After playing the game for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, after which the UK lost 17-0.
Nakarawa scored a second goal for the resumption, with the first half of the game still remaining for over a minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through the more powerless tackles of the British team and crashed over the goal line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended in 29–0.
It seemed like the Fijians were born to play the rugby of seven players, while the British still play the role of a learner.
Which is largely true.
The UK made large-scale changes at half-time and managed to hold the Fijians back for a full four minutes, which, compared to the first half, was a good performance until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to the Fijians’ excellent team play.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation to 36-7 by making a goal for the UK at the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea islanders whose fans in the stand sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's pure joy.
Mata Viliame made the finishing touches to the Fijian cake with a goal in the final moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won the Japanese semi-final in 20–5 and the UK had gone past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the tie was settled by the British goal kick.
Kyle Brown took over the South African Boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-player rugby team player Anthony Watson, seals the victory and ultimately the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
More emotional than this, gold could not be in these races.
From the first draft to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed with 220 victorious bets on history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the oars were two, the boat echoed the voice of the third coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to have their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's duo, making them the first women in the history of British sport to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, the victory for them for the 39th consecutive and once again record-breaking.
What we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the surface of the water as if they were swans, does not fully reflect the nature of success.
Behind each rowing gold there are a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the pair’s achievement. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who diagnosed cancer 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere
and the situation would have been quite bad.
It changes the way of thinking a little."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate to have been able to start their treatment outside the season in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can even say now in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the duo's thoughts were in Williams, who had spent the nervous morning talking a little more than normal trying to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "I've been on an emotional level this week in ruins, which may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we have worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin’s cashier has been fantastic.
Without Robin we would not be anything, so a huge thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I could not have hoped for a better person to work out with, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The duo has found an overwhelming rhythm that their rivals have failed to match.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
We were very close in an instant.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to get off the track."
We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything amazing.
We were not looking for the skies today, we just wanted to make a good rowing and win the race we did."
The duo will think about the year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates her wedding next month with Steve Backshall
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
After London, it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland changes government over Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which will be called for by demonstrators incited by the Panama leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians have circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to the analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last spring rage of the people will affect the election results in the autumn.
In June, the presidential elections showed a clear criticism of those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate for non-political status, was elected.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald Trump, the presidential candidate of the United States Republican Party, withdrew his latest remarks.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the co-founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and the co-founder of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was angry at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be the commander-in-chief of an army who can sink down like that," Clinton said.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a Muslim-favorite burkini bathing suit on beaches, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
According to a decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard, it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swim to anyone who does not have a swimwear that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which largely express religious affiliations, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the object of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two members of the Islamic extremist group attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through a sieve - Lake Pyykösjärvi blue algae cloudiness
Water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue algae clouding has been observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action Agency took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria from all bathing waters on the beaches were below the measures laid down in the Decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations in the water at Meriniemi beach were secured on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue algae opacity observed on the shore of Lake Pyykosjärvi does not yet make water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue algae bloom, resulting in blue-green algae mass forming on the water surface as rafts.
The environmental action follows the situation with more frequent inspections.
If the blue-green algae clouding turns into blue-green algae bloom, it will also be reported separately on the notice board of the beach.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkainen forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside Finland
The forest gift reduction is one of the changes in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction that would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal for a forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of the forest.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest holdings is good, comments Juha Hakkainen, Director of Forest Management at the Central Association of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
However, Hukkainen finds criticism in the proposal for a tax change.
The forest gift reduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner’s clean capital income.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkainen, the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal starts from the fact that by reducing the clean capital income of forestry, it prevents the loss of the capital income of forestry that would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would benefit from the tax even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complex.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkainen says.
In addition, the model only applies to a small proportion of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the return value of the forest is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkainen.
As such, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The Ministry of Finance considers that the border guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the farm.
In forestry policy, the forest gift reduction has been exported for decades, according to Hakkainen.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Strong hailstorm surprised motorists at Himanga - two cars crashed into a ditch and crashed into each other
A special race took place on Friday morning in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the rescue department, two cars in a row went into the ditch, after which the driver came across the front.
According to Harri Pyyhtiä, the fire master on duty, the derailment to the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a severe hailstorm.
The car behind the car had two people, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the above car was not injured.
The accident took place on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research from researchers at the University of Turku can help to make cancer treatments even more effective.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research team show that the hardness of a cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos’ family home killing continues at the court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
The family home killing in Muhos continues in court for both of the convicted.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for the family home killing in Muhos.
The second received 8 years of 4 months of murder and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The sentenced person was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and of transporting the vehicle as a young person.
The district court’s judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the parties and the man who had been sentenced more severely.
The prosecutor calls for a less penalized man to be convicted of a murder committed as a young person for 12 years.
Were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the District Court, the 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a child welfare officer at a school home in July of last year.
The 17-year-old sentenced to death, according to the judgment's reasoning, attacked a pilot sitting on the couch in the back of the living room.
The director had let go of his grip and led the young man into his room, and one of the youngsters hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a mental study, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned to leave the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate shark in the world, only increasing at the age of 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark, according to a study published in Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, an ice shark, i.e. a busher, can live up to 400 years of age.
Females only increase at the age of 156.
The lifetime of the ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows by only one centimeter a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers discovered age at radiocarbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests conducted in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, scientists were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The age of the eldest was estimated at 392 years - although throwing in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Up to a third of all state taxes would not be received if the change to corporate tax imposed by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with tax incentives that benefit the wealthiest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There is really a huge amount left uncollected, $1 000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6 per cent, followed by a reduction of 33 per cent proposed by Trump.
The inheritance tax would be completely abolished.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of business and of running small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards decided on in haste must be reinstated and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
The "destructive" trade policy, according to Trump, is one of the main causes of the United States' problems.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and from Mexico of 35%.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will be driving on the streets, American planes connecting cities, American ships controlling the seas, American steel lifting new skyscrapers all over the country.
Contrary to what he did, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to the Republicans, see the Trump programme leading to a deep economic recession in the United States.
Hillary Clinton announced her own programme early Friday in Finland.
A tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is in a fatal turmoil, but the real tide strikes in the middle of Madrid's street hustle and bustle - accounting with the past can begin.
That is the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodovar’s previous work Travel Lovers (2013) was a fun and dirty satirical comedy, the preceding Skin in which I live (2011) the tops of my Spanish virtuoso career.
Julieta (2016) is situated somewhere between the two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship, and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be on its model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be surprised all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Juliet times the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins from the time before the birth of the daughter, from the time when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will take up the second leading role in the television series Semmet (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a chord, but I would say that it's time for a swiping.
Often for Almodóvar films, there is so much humor in Julieta.
It is an evenly-played, restrained film with good music in some places, and a rather sad film with elements of elegy.
Instead, the typical visual saturation of the Spanish director is preserved and begins to slowly enter the eye more as a pure form than as a functioning dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are affected by diseases, deaths or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally choreous.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of the name person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular ears.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main thing, that is, the exorcisms of the scene in question, do not improve on this in particular.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly infertile.
Almodóvar has written a book based on three short stories by the Nobel Prize laureate Alice Munro.
The short stories have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly uniform literary filming.
There would have been a lot of material for an emotionally incomparable drama, so much big things - especially the gnawing guilt - the thematics of the film deal with.
Director and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on 12.8.
Government is trying to win elections - People's News
No new cuts will be made, say the ministers, so that the Finns in general will not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made by a lot.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (Centre Party) say under the budget session.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM’s proposal, because the cuts to social security were already decided in the spring spending limits discussion.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Education cuts continue.
Municipal elections are haunting
Why is it that the ministers are so hard at stressing that no new cuts are made on top of these?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal election result, which takes the parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the Gallups report that the Finnish government party expects a roll-over loss, even though the result of its previous elections was modest at 12.3%.
Four years ago, the True Finns received 752 new delegates, most of whom will be realised next spring at the cost of influencing the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the government of the three approximately equal parties depends on the ability of the Finns as a whole to survive.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of the government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's state of fermentation have also come to the surface.
The new cuts will not come, first of all, blurs the fact that next year they will be made violently and, second, attempts will be made to soften the shock that awaits the Finns.
Major surgeries in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different - if the government of Sipilä is still standing.
The Government has set itself the goal of reducing the debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take a debt of EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands mid-term and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: the debt will not fall or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be built at least close to balance during 2018 and then, in the spring, we will receive what comes in the parliamentary elections.
Indebtedness is not covered by these measures
It is quite clear that indebtedness will not be reversed by current measures, even if Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove it inexorably:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no support for the international economy.
The Finnish economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except during a temporary stimulus policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this decade and has increased from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros per year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost approximately EUR 6 billion, which will be covered in practice by taking on a whole new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party as to what is responsible.
Question: Municipalities want to be left with a lot of tasks
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity for children is the responsibility of the municipality, according to research conducted by the KAKs - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also rolls out responsibility for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management to an individual municipality.
The county is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities.
There is no desire to transfer any tasks under the responsibility of municipalities to the state.
A minor drunken driver ran after the chase to escape the police
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol at Ilomantsitie on Friday night half at one time.
The police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle that had driven without lights, but the young man left to drive the police at a fair speed.
The pursuit continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from there to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after that, the young man ran away running, but the faster-legged policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
The breath test performed on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license that would justify driving a motorcycle.
Among other things, the case is being investigated as a serious endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck in a stone load fell into a ditch
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch on Lake Polvijärvi, Kaavintie, on Thursday evening at 21.15.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into the ditch.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the overturned truck through the door together with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
The car owner was left with the task of raising the vehicle.
The fallen truck spilled hydraulic oil on the road, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police investigate the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in Ilmajoki
Since the afternoon, a 87-year-old woman has been staying in Ilmajoki Bay Village in Southern Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about 165 centimetres long, slim and well-knit with white hair under her chin.
Observations and hints of lost movements are requested to call the helpline of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre 0295440513.
Major-accident materials in the air - see photo gallery of Parafest's destruction
The rush flow that fell into the tents of Parafest Festivals caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially on its feet, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest’s last performer, Kalle Salonen, performed on the market stage at the end of Friday evening.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances on the City Theatre premises starting at 13 a.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
A surge flow occurs in a thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger a drop in air flow.
The changes in the state of the water in the thunderstorm bind heat, and therefore the decreasing air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several surges occur in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of downturns.
The surge hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, there were about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child, who was transported with a slight injury to further care.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for the ageing of the skin is air pollution.
The UK study is told by the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses London’s most toxic fine particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, for example, an elderly person living in rural areas.
Small particles ageing the skin are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, almost 9 500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have found that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
A Caci study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who travel on their commutes near busy streets.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution with different masks, for example, but it is recommended that the skin be cleaned regularly.
The tractor's brakes failed - shoved the man in front
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man did not get under it, but the tractor managed to push the man so much that he was transported to the central hospital after further investigation seriously injured.
The tractor could not run further, as it came across the rocks in front of it.
Fancy the season ahead with new forces
League-Riento from Joensuu, playing in the Volleyball Championship League, will start in October with a series of better starting points than men’s memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
A common tune can be found better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Riento.
Jani Säisä, who continues as the head coach of Riento, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni starts his second season in Rieno.
The new face is the 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who appeared in the Rwandan national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passport, the Brazilian has a measurement of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and Jokipoika to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost all of the world championships in floorball since 2003.
Now the sixth competition is going on in Tampere, only in 2013 was missed when Canada was better at the North American Qualifiers.
I was working and playing with women in Turku when I noticed the announcement.
The USA was setting up a floorball team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, the kind of sport was not yet played at the SM level like the floorball.
The spade was played at the university.
I played basketball in Juniper and later ice hockey in Jokipojat in the Finnish Championship, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship in 1991-92 with the university, the following three seasons took place in Josba.
In addition to playing, he prepared the club's A-girls for the championship.
Women's Finnish Championship culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the Women’s Finnish Championship through 10 seasons, with a balance of 169 matches 51+34=85.
The latest season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
Josban grew up by Perttu Puska and Enoist-oriented Tatu Väänänen was chosen to join the Finnish national team, which plays in the Czech EFT tournament in Brno on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men’s national games before, where he has a total of 9+4=13 power points.
Swiss defenceman Wiler-Ersigen’s 32-year-old defenceman Tatu Väänänen has recovered from the femoral problem and is a member of the national team’s standard fleet with 117 national matches.
The national team was also named as the veteran player of the Seinäjoki Game Brothers, Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at last December’s World Cup.
The head coach of the floorball team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley virtuoso Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to finish as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volley Championships will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
In three days, medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the Finnish Volleyball Championship organised by the Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best teams in each league will be qualified.
The local colour of the event is represented by Essi Hasu, who grew up in Elimäki YMKY, who has been a member of the top beach volleys in Finland for several years.
Today, Hasu lives in Helsinki and is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope that as many people as possible will be able to go to the auditorium this weekend.
There will certainly be a great arena for the stadium.
I’m not very often in adult leagues in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu says.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu’s spark in sports and gave him a good start to a great hobby.
There are very many memories of childhood.
I started playing volleyball at the age of 9 in Elimäki YMKY's E-girls.
The main thing in mind is too big a shirt, knee pads on the ankles and ace cries and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were heavily involved - the team mate's father coached us and our mother was the club's chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was a natural choice for indoor volleyball in junior times.
A track has been played on the Curve pond beach since the 1990s.
The operation has always been active.
I also went to watch the juniors’ Finnish Championships, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays the weekend together with Anniina Parkinen from Pieksämäki in the SM-finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We are still missing the SM gold in the prize cabinet, Hasu throws a mystery.
This weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be Hasu’s last in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, there will be new challenges in civilian work.
The international career is over after the tournament in Kisakallio.
Otherwise, the flip flops will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Fall flow poured tents at the event of disabled people in Joensuu, the earthquake was near

Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 17 a.m.
Markus Viitaniemi, the fire officer interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that there were ingredients for the incident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Solomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweat and energy.
The young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future even in rural areas.
Just two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, started working as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come into the hand of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always enjoyed doing things on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything into play.
If something starts, I think it has to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a barn, and the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I myself was very brave to join the project and I have been fully involved in it,” says Solomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of clean Finnish food and that everything would still turn out to be good.
The goal of Salomon Koli, a meat-growing company, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the Young Food Producer’s Competition of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the newspaper's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.

The average annual inflation measured by the CPI over the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index for July 2016 was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been –0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was –0.2%.

Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's anime effect is criticized as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was inspired by the anime, but some observers believe it is racist.
With the Snapchat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that converge with absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are unpretentious, feature-distorting tools that create over 30 million enhanced selfies per day.
All the missteps quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized where it has been accused of favouring blackface or bleached skin tones as an ideal.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes oblique, distorted their teeth and made their cheeks plump, some of the critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered if these repeated contradictions suggest a greater problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday, with e.g. the online publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat announced that it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to the characters of the anime, not to the caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some vehemently disputed the anime parable.
The Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets about the images were widely shared, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing".
He adds: "It's hard to deny that a very tasteless Asian caricature is comparable to a filter effect.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one that has been taken to a low-end extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the devices we carry with us.
The general public of Snapchat is made up of young people who are more ethnically diverse than their older counterparts.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that offends the user, these types of things will no longer easily go unnoticed, as before,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In a Medium article and a telephone interview, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of respect for diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s leadership, mostly white and men-only, and ended his writing with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
It is either that there are no people of color in their unilateral staff, so that they can make decisions like this, or they also have people of color as employees, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily," says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its personnel, relying on its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but its spokesperson said the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups of people and to promote inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this isn't OK."
According to the Congressional Expert Group, intelligence on Isis was misrepresented by military officials
On Thursday, the congressional expert team published a report saying that the intelligence reports of the U.S. armed forces, the Central Command, were modified to give a more optimistic picture of the war against the Isis in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the ground suggested.
The Republican Chairs of the House Armed Services Committee set up a working group to report on the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts.
The Central Command, in brief Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The intelligence findings approved by the senior leaders of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the U.S. counter-terrorism measures than the facts on the ground, and were invariably more positive than the analyses of other units in the intelligence community,” the report says.
Centcom events are unacceptable – our soldiers are suffering when false analyses are presented to high-level political decision-makers,” said Ken Calvert, a Republican in California.
Mistakes in the management of Centcom extend to the highest level of the organisation."
In terms of scope, the 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 that the Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi troops include.
Although the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports commissioned by the Obama administration are false, it gives the analysts the impression that Centcom executives have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command’s press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than what was actually happening,” the report says.
For example, a Centcom official publicly issued a statement that a major military assault to retake Mosul could already take place in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of Isis.
After months of research, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican representative for Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence officers in the U.S. armed forces manipulate the intelligence results obtained to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group to learn of analysts' suspicions that intelligence about Isis was being manipulated.
The report, which was published on Thursday, is followed by more detailed results, as the studies continue.
In addition, the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee published their own results, partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process to assess intelligence on Isis and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's senior representative for democracy.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, "violated the morale of analysts" and "deficiently disregarded divergent views".
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to a "pre-determined or political political line".
The Daily Beast news site reported the preliminary results of a study conducted by Congress on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the investigation of the Pentagon Chief Inspector, which began as a result of actions brought by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Chief Inspector's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence hold a positive healthy dialogue on these key national security issues."
The investigation has other repercussions, in addition to the fact that it is seeking to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (an argument put forward by more and more military authorities).
However, the allegations made last year raised concerns about how much President Obama can count on the Central Command to provide honest estimates of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of IS intelligence is similar to the controversy that arose more than a decade ago when the Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, published a study that, despite the opposition of many analysts in President George W. Bush's government, only supported a small number of troops to Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Isis intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker working group concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes on the refineries controlled by Isis had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group, as it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the result of the study was not communicated outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after a number of legislators had estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive about the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth duel in women's field hockey and consolidates its position in the fight against Britain
After three goals in a victorious 6–1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had done the same before.
I have no idea," he says.
I am not one of the people who keep track of the goals they have scored.
However, he knows this: The Americans have won four games in their Olympic Games and lost zero games and share the first place in their group with Britain, which continued to win its winning streak on Thursday with Japan in numbers 2 to 0.
Britain and the United States will play against each other on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Each team survived the final match, which determines which of them will be the first and which of the six teams will be the second.
First place to avoid a longer encounter with the hard-pressed Dutch team that won the second block.
No matter what happens in Saturday's game, the Americans have already stirred up about their surprising success in these games, four years after it was last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the field hockey club for the first time until he was 3 years old (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make the final list of players.
Then came the 2012 race, where he and his team had little success.
The following year, Craig Parnham from England was appointed coach, and things began to change.
The change was cultural, mental, and physical," says Bam.
Our pace of work in London was not what it is now.
We have made a complete translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened a goal account in the first half by hitting the ball close by with a knuckle.
India had entered the game without a single tournament win, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 position all the way to the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball long along the left side of the field, squirming into the middle field, scoring the ball to the finish line, thus taking the Americans 2–0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The game was the first in a tournament in which US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty.
Briggs is now living through his success,
Just like Bam.
Our investment is now good," says Parnham, but how good it is depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympic rush, the trampoline brings zen
Regardless of the place and time, the Olympic Games will inevitably come across.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and battles seem to be a constant and everywhere message.
As if the Olympic fire itself was a flaming baton, moving from a archer to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast and from a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can’t open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbour’s conversation about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos in the queue of the café.
And then there is a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-timer of the Olympic Games, smiles and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be popular with sponsors and would appear in good-natured TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold with a trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Further away from the centre, partly in the shade are lesser-known sports such as air gun shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favourite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
While athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, the country has never reached the medals nor made any progress to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side, the medals have been picked up by the Canadians.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has the charm of an underdog, partly because it sounds more appropriate to an uncivilized ear than to an Olympic circus school.
(I acknowledge in this regard that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The species has its comic potential, which has been used in the cartoons in the characters’ endless bouncing scenes, but it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming jumps, that is, the species that are essentially combined in the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "springboard".
Ambitious champions jump on a huge trampoline that will eject them to a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as threads, folding and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are judged on performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries compete for the trampoline gymnastics championship, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
When looking for gold, medalists must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the goal line, sometimes facing back around the field.
In addition to the goal line or the starting wall, they also have another goal they are aiming for in televised reports, namely a world or Olympic record.
This purposeful pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical – and even enough to bring the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting when it comes to watching competitions.
For this, the trampoline provides a pause of breath.
In the trampoline, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down and pops back up easily.
Of course, the sport also has a competitive aspect, and it is not easy, but it is not accompanied by an intense rush to the finish line or jumping far, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It is as close to the zen as only the Olympic Games can get.
Women’s qualifying matches and finals are held on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men’s matches on Saturday at the same time.
NBC broadcasts the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts at 14.00 local time each day.
In the midst of Olympianism, bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that could be missed in the midst of the general hustle and bustle.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering appealing male athletes and objectifying them – as the US men’s gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his staggering new fan base.
An entire generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dispersed protests demanding political change across Ethiopia.
According to eyewitnesses, several demonstrators have been killed in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries and a reliable Western ally whose economy has grown rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests that are spreading into ever-wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding profound political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government’s reaction was relentless.
According to eyewitnesses, police officers shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
The videos of the demonstrations, probably at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how security forces are beating young people who are forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN's Chief Human Rights Officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is all the more difficult,” says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group for the Horn of Africa project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence support Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has radically improved, the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
Ethiopia is far from a model country for democracy, however. Human rights organisations have consistently reported government repression policies, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly suppressed.
Many people have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
If a nation is suppressed and has no choice but to demonstrate, it will break out," says Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
An entire generation protests."
There are many grounds for dissatisfaction, ranging from land use to the stranglehold of the government coalition.
After last year's widely criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies were given the last place previously held by the opposition, and as a result they now dominate the entire parliament.
At the same time, tensions are escalating along the Eritrean border, where the escalated situation took hundreds of lives in the fight in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups more or less defeated in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the confusion and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been hanging under the surface for years is breaking out right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media as cheaper smartphones became commonplace and access to the internet improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people access the internet through proxy servers that encrypt their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest groups of Ethiopians, the Oromas and the Amharas.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
The Amharas, mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have long dominated the country's politics and business and exploited oromas, much of which are Muslims and live in the lowland areas.
But this too is changing.
Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six per cent of the population and nevertheless dominates the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to the analysts, he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors who conciliated the relations between the opposing parties.
The current government lacks this essential instinct," says Abdi, a conflict researcher.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desallegn stepped into the shoes of Meles, almost from the unknown.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security forces controlled by the tigre tribe.
Many are afraid this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time similar riots took place in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections, which the government, according to analysts, first toned and then tossed.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and the unrest ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment of the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from intensifying.
And resentment is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the city of Gondar, protesters attacked Tigre-owned companies, and anti-Tigre hate speech is on the rise in social media.
Analysts say that protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft observing neighbouring Somalia, but the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable allies to collapse.
This requires a tight balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to withdraw his words in the latest campaign dispute by claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters also find themselves in an embarrassing situation, who must try to defend their candidate during these turbulent moments and explain the comments he may not have intended.
Trump made the claim at an election on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that President Clinton had created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
On Twitter, Trump completely ran his speech from the day before, when he said in several interviews that he had been quite serious about his accusations.
When radio host and Conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw his claim.
The latest review storm rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their political speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and said Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he appeared to be urging the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and, if necessary, pulls back his words.
I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that resonate with his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to the messages, and then “clarifies” one way or another depending on the reactions,” says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
But I also believe he understands his claims and knows they are round enough to pass through different sieves.
Instead of softening his statements to the general public, Trump has in recent days changed his style even more stingy as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new poll published on Friday by NBC, Wall Street Journal, and Marist reported that Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while in Florida the situation is strictly equal.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologising for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after becoming more and more vigilant in the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position where they have to publicly defend Trump's comments no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump's main supporters, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, vigorously defended the presidential candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
I consider his statements to be a justified, political speech," said Giuliani, when asked if Trump was truthful when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded ISIS.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, which Obama completely mistakenly called a "lower league team" and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to continue its actions when it failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of gushing his speeches and discriminatory attitudes towards him.
He mocked the "unworthy and pitiful" television commentators who tried to find out about him, but he said they could not succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said it would only make it even clearer that he was not fit for the presidency.
Unreasonable rent increase opens coffee shop in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a slightly sloppy café in Williamsburg, where cash was used only and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café was priced out of its street-side location on Bedford Avenue when the rent rose to an unreasonable level.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals consider this loss of a café that has been evaded from the middle class to be deplorable.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe there is no CBGB club anymore, the Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer what it used to be, new things are also being created there.
In November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a kilometer north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and can pay by credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unsophisticated.
Coffee is still good too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things intact.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
It also reintroduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
Bacon-egg-cheese-sandwiches are available and capers and browned onion rings are available for filling.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
The café no longer offers beer, but instead juices made from fresh fruit.
After nine months at the café, Rodriguez says that he has noticed that old regulars have begun to visit Verb as a steady stream.
Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited a café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he went on walks to Verb in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
I realized I liked Verb coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea blend instead of his regular ice coffee, which is also a listing.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He always went to the café before work and ordered the same without exception.
I entered the café every day more than seven quarters a day, like a machine, and there they already prepared my butterbagel with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he varies from bagels to bacon, eggs and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says there is no resentment that the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is made using Verb’s own cold brewed coffee.
We may still seize the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with pleasure.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbours feel welcome.
The new location has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee in the café.
The café may also expand into an adjacent building.
However, for many customers, it is enough for them to get their own old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the café closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home,” says Whitt.
I missed the smell of the café.
The Great Depression in a New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after his presidential rise, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office in the White House.
Known as a culinary artist, President Roosevelt was fond of the luxury dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as goose liver pastry and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, plum pudding.
It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells the story of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to a meeting place with the journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in the same year as the big stock market crash, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a sandwich filled with cream cheese and olives, while 57-year-old Coe ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the journalist ordered a meat loaf, the couple said it would suit the discussion on eating a very large depression.
The loaf was very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
People ate peanut loaf, liver loaf and bean loaf.
They were made of substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe grins.
It must have been pressed on the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the Great Depressions, the American dining room, especially in the countryside, operated on the principle of a buffet "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry people during the First World War. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when they suddenly had to give up their abundance.
This was the time when food became a central and distressing topic for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as distressing was the new affordable diet: Ziegelman said that enigmatic foods such as pastries and casseroles became the main food, and casserole foods were said to be "a great way to take advantage of food scraps" because chefs could cover not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been the most important part of American food, became a sparing luxury.
We tried strange blends, where the most important thing was to fill the calories and nutrients, rather than taste or even common sense.
While doing research for a book that also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared oven bulbs filled with peanut butter used as a short-lived dish.
It didn’t get popular at the dinner table,” says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion do not match at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
From 1923 to 1943, household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the director of the Federal Home Office, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be precise budget keepers and to respond to the challenge of making sweet dishes like carrot-cream packets.
A Square Meal is a historical treat.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising his childhood with simple food on an Iowan farm, he himself ate, like the millionaire and the sophisticated gentleman he had become.
He liked the European cuisine on the continent, like fish and cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate almost in a gold-coated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in the taste, the dishes served in the White House were not only Washington's most boring, but also the worst prepared."
Many of the food of the recession period was abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
When the couple wrote the book, they began to better understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, why she could not throw away food.
He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," Coe said.
People even started to get sick of his food," Ziegelman recalls.
For example, once on wind hats.
After the main dishes were emptied at the lunch bar in Eisenberg, Ziegelman and Coe brought out the plum dessert they made at home, the same as President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, adding that giving a spectacular name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We sinked our spoons reluctantly into a thick brown goblet.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe sanded for the second time and for the third time.
Walnuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget keeper.
Gilad receives full compensation for legal fees for a patent dispute with Merck for a hepatitis C medicine
The U.S. regional court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full compensation for the legal fees it incurred for a patent dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from the $200 million in damages it had been ordered for infringement of two patents owned by Merck for the successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. A US judge found that Merck had committed violations, including false oaths and other unethical practices.
On Thursday, the U.S. regional court judge, Beth Labson Freeman, said that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the legal fees it was charged for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can be used to treat more than 90% of patients with hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
US-backed forces have taken over Manbiji City from Isis
US-backed troops have gained control of the city of Manjib in northern Syria, near the Turkish border, when the last militants of the extremist organization Isis left the city, according to a statement by the troops' spokesperson.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now raking around the city to find the last Isis fighters hiding in the city.
A representative of the Manbiji Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2 000 hostages abducted by the Isis fighters had been released.
The city is now entirely under our control, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced on Friday her 2015 tax return, showing that her and her husband's income at the time was $10.75 million and their actual federal tax rate of 34.2 million.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton announced that she earned $3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her office in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's presidential candidate, Virginia's Senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton, announced 10 years of tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show a model for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant, Jennifer Palmieri, in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
As usual, U.S. presidential candidates have always made their tax information public, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the Tax Administration for an audit and say it is the reason why Trump has not disclosed his income data.
The move is yours," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said, referring to the tax information of the candidate for democracy.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, a special attorney at Trump, told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax information until the inspections were completed.
Trump critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's equity, his contributions to charity, business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has addressed this question and posted a video on Friday online showing prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release their tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, not his public tax returns,” Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax attorneys and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue for presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton Elections in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate headquartered in the same location, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to an audit by the Tax Board and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in the city of Chappaqua in the state of New York, paid an average federal tax of 32% between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income of $109 000.

Firearm condoms filled with chilli powder to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements – elephants are rushed by throwing chilli powdered condoms at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which developed the idea a few years ago, has launched a campaign together with the American Nature Conservancy to teach volunteers in the villages of Northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and crops without harming elephants.
Some time ago, spears were used to stagger elephants.
Friday is the elephant day of the world dedicated to animal protection.
After developing the method, we have seen attitudes change in these villages, because now the villagers can trust that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, Executive Director of Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intrusive elephant is alarmed by pointing a flashlight and calling the horn.
If this does not work, discard the so-called chilli cloud.
The chilli powder mixed with the soil is placed in the condom together with the electrician, after which the end of the condom is twisted so that only the ignition wire remains outside.
When the ignition wire is ignited, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine cloud of chilli powder into the air.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last resort is the launcher, which shoots a fireworks in the air, known as the Roman candle, and creates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticises Berlin hotel for removing Israel's directional number from Arab "invitation" – RT News
A French, Jewish film director gave birth to a media rage after revealing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not mention Israel's country code on its list of land codes.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Shoah documentary on Holocaust, broke his frustration with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the area code list provided by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries where you can call directly from the room.
How is it that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's reply shocked him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the action further shocked the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's area code."
Interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman said the incident was a "great shame".
The case shocks and shocks all of us.
It is a great shame.
And the more shameful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and it is this hotel chain.
There is no need for further explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the Ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction on the web, in which it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving up on alleged claims by Arab customers.
Shame" was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel denied the charges quickly, called the incident an error and apologised to Lanzmann.
A direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never issued," writes a representative of the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students
Students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered together to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when law enforcement authorities tried to break up a group of students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, who wanted to show their dismay at the government's plans.
Governor of the State of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has made a proposal for a austerity measure in which nearly a hundred public schools are closed and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some of the demonstrators made graffiti on the walls, which temporarily opposed Michel Temer, who held the office of President.
The student demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were filled with demonstrators who supported President Dilma Rousseff, while the country's Senate voted on an indictment against him.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Since the lifting of sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, Russian business interest in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
Russian companies will continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further trade growth is one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to $856 million.
Russia's exports to Iran in particular rose rapidly by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The trade was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Mission in Iran issued about 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries visited by citizens of Russia.
And it is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he says.
Scottish Callum Skinner finishes with the British win over gold for cycling
Scottish Callum Skinner claimed a reputation in the men's team print at the Rio Velodrome last night, when the British trio defended the 2012 London-deserved championship.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow played the role of anchor, which he inherited from his compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud by thanking the goal and winning from the New Zealand team, which was considered a favourite.
Britain won four years ago when Hoy won his fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing sixth place at the World Championships in Athletics held in London in March, despite Hoy's subsequent career as a racer.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialises in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out just at the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man the British coach believed in and where they saw the potential he has now claimed.
Hindes, with Hoy, won the championship four years ago with Kenny and Skinner making the Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won a duel of gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his tour, but Kenny made an effort to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes was able to slow down the pace at a higher rate, which allowed Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep pace.
Hoy followed up as BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow says, "I am flattered by the parallel.
I just try to do my best and succeed.
We made the Olympic record in the final and won the World Cup.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had deliberately crashed due to a bad start.
He later withdrew his word and there was no appeal from the British rivals.
This time, there were no such problems with the sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The atmosphere was like in London, all UK flags were flying in the stands.
Our team became united in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that it feels great to win at the Olympics."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress made over the past five months, then five days with a velodrome will have been a success.
As Kenny has shown with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold medals at one Olympic Games.
This would mean accumulating an account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was also born on March 23 (the magical date of British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would then be the same as for Hoy.
Next, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and resolves in three days.
Twenty-eight-year-old Kenny from Bolton says: "I can only enjoy this at the moment.
Team competition is always the best.
You get to enjoy the win together with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins another two gold medals, he must get the rank of a knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four-man team race.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record that was made in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (at 22.42) will be competed today on the second day of the race, and Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competition officials before the time trial, when the officials invited him to measure his length.
In a similar women's competition that will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached a world record time of 4:13.260.
The UK team can now count on its great cycling team to take over the middle of the Olympics and bring in a number of medals.
After the truly extraordinary evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas, the least of which has been the resignation of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April, among allegations of sexism and bullying, and the ending of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the first night of the race with the Velodrome shows that Britain’s already legendary reputation is once again coming to the top at a perfect moment.
The future of the Portland smelting plant at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelting plant in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when a power company operating electricity for the smelting plant reported that one of the factory’s owners is about to terminate the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend the subsidies to keep the plant in operation.
Fixed support for 20 years will expire in November.
The Alcoa plant in Portland is in danger of losing up to 2000 jobs.
As a result of closures, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the smelting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's smelting plant, resulting in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland meltdown is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to speculations that have been going on for years about the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the price of the factory's production.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects the other three smelters to terminate their contract as well.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina. The Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority stakes in the plant.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
The AGL states that the agreements are so-called hedging agreements, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period for contracts is 12 months, so they will expire in 2017.
Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue for the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential profit impact for AGL from the financial year 2018 is currently limited by the strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already lowered the value of contracts in its accounting by $ 187 million as a "anticipation for the termination of contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's capacity to keep the smelting plant in operation or to secure electricity supply to the smelting plant".
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into effect from November this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the contract.
Due to the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their assessments of both the smelting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In a speech earlier this week, Stephen Mikkelsen, operational director of AGL, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
If these plants leave the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand on the (electricity) market.
It would not be good news for us as a producer," says Mikkelsen.
Kendall, the reality television star of the Kardashians, as the cover girl of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, poses in the famous September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and appeared at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
Looking at the deck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover image was followed by a strange (or perhaps only in the style of the Kardashians series?), a scripted video featuring all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favourite uncle, the producer of the Kardashians program Ryan Seacrest) showing that he forgot his sister's cover image. The video ends with a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is clichéd, and is used in almost all of the ascension program birthday episodes (Seacrest says, "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to get the rest of his daughters involved in some way in this release.
For the appearance in the September issue of Vogue undoubtedly marks the new age of the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim was able to make Vogue's claim before (she appeared on Vogue's cover together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
September's issue is Vogue's best-selling publication in a year.
The number, which is more like a large picture book than a fashion magazine, attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion website Fashion calculated that there were 615 pages of advertisements in the 832 page book last year).
The publication of the September number cover star is so eagerly expected that in the two previous years the images of the magazine have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Earlier in September, cover models include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In the last few years, the cover has been made up of celebrities working on the model rather than models that are famous.
Oscar winner and Dior advertising face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later she was honored by Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for her generation, and even if she was one of the famous people who worked on the model, she is still in a pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars, or modern-day children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career behind her, when she released her album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of her reality TV background, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be difficult.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid for calling them "bitches".
These feelings have resurfaced when news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover came out.
However, it seems irrelevant to keep up with dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner is a cover model of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks in Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
She is the advertising face of Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she portrayed in Love.
And in his free time, he appears on reality TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160 000 people a year
Every year, more than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people in the country are turned away from the legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the effects that further cuts in funding will have on the centres already operating at the extremes.
In the state of Queensland, three out of five applicants for free legal aid and legal services are already being turned away – most of them are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and those with similar injustices without the resources to fight.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are in danger of losing another 30% of federal funding.
According to James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, thousands of people are being turned away from the centres each year, according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres.
If the federal government does not turn around, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
Queensland’s public legal aid centres are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away when they apply for the necessary services they need,” Farrell says.
People from violent relationships, people under an uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, divorced families, unjustly laid off workers – all of them have problems with legal issues, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% as of June 2017, which means thousands of those in a vulnerable position in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and the Senator of Queensland, George Brands, to end these cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign brought an action for employee threat with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued when no action was supposed to be taken after its leadership had been told that the campaign leader in North Carolina had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in the Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordini at the State Court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini says he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he understood, according to his own words, that this is not going to happen.
Bordini says in his action that campaign leader Earl Phillip "brought out the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pressed the pipe into Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, Bordini heard that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
Even if the gun is not launched, it will cause damage," Bordini says in his action.
The action comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate made a general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second additional article" - who are considered arms owners and gunmen - can take action if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the election and gets to choose the judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media dissociated his words from their context and Trump, in his words, did not encourage violence.
In his action, Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for indifferent leadership and Phillip for the assault, assault and mental suffering caused by it.
Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking her for a comment.
Despite the efforts, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to the call to Phillip’s consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been running a controversial campaign.
Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates prosperity – not only in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was something that was of the greatest interest in Heathrow. As at the 2012 London Olympics, we invested enormously in the benefit of our entire nation and all of our regions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we are creating 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think the Heathrow expansion is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that we are in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question it asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits not only a few, but also many.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and grow the economy by £211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, including the T5 terminal – voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of two of the world’s most congested runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway backed by a private investment of £16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to extend Heathrow to ensure the future of our trade and to create skills and employment that the UK can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and former Commercial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad blocker in cat-mouse play
The efforts of online advertising companies to mislead advertising-blocking software have become a cat-mouse game, says one company that produces blocking software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it was blocking advertising programs on its own page, Adblock Plus published a blog post stating that users can update the filters in their blocking software and thus again block social media ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising codes on its desktop site to make it harder for ad-blocking programs to identify which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock says it has cleared the new codes.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "such a snippet between an open-source ad-blocking community and deceptives has been going on ever since the ad-blocking was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own correction.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern advertising blockers have become in the industry.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use ad-blocking programs, according to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, which has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users on mobile devices every day, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in deceiving advertising programs in its desktop app, as the spokesperson said that mobile ad blocking programs are not working on Facebook mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook found the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it will update the advertising tool for user preferences so that users can more control how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock’s new filters because it also said they prevented some of the usual Facebook posts from appearing.
This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad-blocking programs are clumsy and inefficient, which is why we have instead invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of ads themselves.
Woman commits suicide by abandoning cars on Swiss motorway
The victim was on a highway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for eyewitness assistance on the motorway from an accident that occurred during the first hours of Thursday, in which a woman deliberately dropped herself under more than one car.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate act by lying down on a dark road, and she was hit by more than one car, says the Vaudi police in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, with a clear intention of committing suicide, and a truck among the overdrives.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter explains in the Le Tribune de Geneva newspaper that a criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in such a situation.
It remains to be seen, however, whether the motorists involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to find out," says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases in which motorists are not held responsible.
According to the newspaper, in either case, a person walked on a dark highway and the court ruled that motorists could not expect to come across a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of charges against him for his death on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and had gone out on the road.
The court held that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, had a justifiable driving style and that the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Anyone who knows anything about an accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study the past of Venus with the same tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The model was intended to determine whether conditions in Venus could have sometimes been similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and water-free and its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations by researchers, the slow rotation rate of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to that of the Earth, and has nevertheless been running slowly.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% fainter.
In GISS’s modelling, Venus rotates slowly and its day-end is almost two months apart from the sun,” says Anthony Del Genio, a researcher at GISS in the press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like an umbrella and protects the surface to a large extent from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the evaporated water.
As hydrogen escaped into space, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and a lethal greenhouse effect remained — i.e. Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported on the results of the new Venus climate modelling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy relinquishes as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club’s ice hockey business, arguing for lack of influence in the team’s decision-making.
Joe Sakic, Deputy CEO/Director General of Colorado, confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
For the past three years, I have been doing my job as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice president of the club’s ice hockey activities with vigour, passion and determination,” says 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
Over the summer, I have been thinking hard about how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and vice president of the club’s ice hockey activities must be in full line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sakic.
We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the Year in the League for his first season as Avalanche’s chief coach from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and hasn't finished the season in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 points in the 2015-2016 season and remained five points away from the Minnesota Wild when playing from another Wild Card slot at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop the strike
The chief negotiators report that wage strikes by oil workers in the North Sea will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
There have been strikes against Wood Group, a company providing oilfield services, on drilling rigs under the control of Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will have several full-day meetings in the coming weeks, where we will deal with problems from fresh perspectives.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, the Wood Group will cut tariffs for its suppliers operating in the North Sea by approximately 9% this year.
The reduction in the company’s tariffs follows a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors operating in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it the room for manoeuvre necessary to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut back thousands of employees from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas drilling operations in up to 10 countries, thus seeking to boost its operations after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the decision taken by the UK in June to leave the European Union create pressure on energy companies.
A Scottish MP, Dave Anderson, met with workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts the North Sea has experienced for an entire generation.
He said the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that benefits many and not only a few," says Anderson.
New North Sea projects are expected to spend less than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared to around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped the astronomers compile the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of the stars in the Pleiades cluster so far.
Based on the new data, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how rotation times are related to their planetary formation.
We hope that by comparing the results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star weight and age and even the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at the University of Pasadena's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis.
The Pleiadian star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning faster than ever.
When the speed of rotation is at its peak, large amounts of star wind are emitted from the growing stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of the recognisable star spots (which correspond to the sun spots).
The latest listed speed data suggests that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – bigger ones roll slower than smaller ones.
We see from the Pleiades' "dance" that the slow-rotating ones are typically larger, while the fastest-rotating ones are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Plejade cluster is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star characteristics with rotational velocities.
The Pleiadian star cluster provides a pillar for theoretical models of rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information on how, when and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
