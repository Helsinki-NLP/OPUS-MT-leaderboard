28-year-old chef found dead shopping mall in San Francisco
Recently, a 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says that he doesn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, “His things finally went well.”
The body that was found in the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco Frank Galician, the San Francisco Bureau of the Cause of Death was said.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was defined as a spirit crime and that the investigation is ongoing.
His brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel to KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line chef in Boston, had his dream job as a line chef at the San Francisco restaurant Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A Sons & Daughters representative said they are “abused and shocked” because of his death.
We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be missing hard,” the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed at the hostels first, but that “his things were finally going well.”
He found an apartment and dated a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that no one knows who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a great heart.
His way of feeling together with the family was to make us food, to make dinner,” Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any controversy.
He was a brother who drifted with the stream.
In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a uncut diamond that shone brighter every day,” he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department tip line at 415-575-4444.
Doctoral trainees on strike: Requirements for new industrial action
Representatives of physician trainees have requested their trade union to adopt new industrial action in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) calls on the Council to support new industrial action from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
Doctoral trainees and medical students voted to reject an agreement that had been agreed with BMA in July.
58 per cent of the voters rejected it.
On Thursday night, in a letter from Twitter, the JDC President, Ellen McCourt, said that the government had stayed “suspendedly quiet” on questions that led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: “In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject a completely proposed new agreement and demand formal renegotiations for all your concerns.”
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the Council of the BMA to authorise the progressive and expanding industrial action programme starting early in September.
The dispute has led to physician trainees taking part in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stoppage in the history of the NHS healthcare system.
The director of BMA’s doctor trainees, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after rejecting the terms and conditions recommended by BMA.
He had told the members of the BMA before 54,000 doctor trainees and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will be imposed on English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: External consortium?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands on each other and proclaim the eight-month struggle between words and economic sanctions to end.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague Peter’s palace in a gold-plated hall, I got a clear impression that in Ankara I wanted this more reconciliation.
Yes, the event was handled.
But Putin's smile seemed to be violent, and he did not quite overflow with heat, even according to his own subdued norms.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, was constantly talking about his “loving friend” Putin - five times according to a report.
I shuffled the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even better.
The next day the newspapers here described Erdogan’s conduct as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm represented the opposite.
But the coolness of Putin showed that the leader of Russia has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked, accusing Ankara that it stabbed Moscow on the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Reconstruction of true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian general public has also changed since November.
For months, government-controlled media led an astounding, in-depth attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of the high officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in the Syrian regions controlled by Isis.
He has forbade this emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting only took place because Putin received his apology from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing with Ankara are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown from power in the failed coup of last month.
Continuous terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
In addition, there is an economic motive.
Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by nearly 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines are certainly relieved when flights eventually continue.
They are hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since importing agricultural products from Turkey again.
Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” as the report of Vedemosti was formulated.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding a long-standing long-standing resentment of the EU snail-based negotiations will bring out Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the coolness and erode Turkish ties to the West.
The leader of Russia was guaranteed to get loose points from Ankara, where he called after the revolution company to support the designated authorities.
Sure, this is a survival for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of the change of power.
So this meeting in a prime seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present a “outside association” as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries who feel that the Westerns rejected them and mistreated them, uniting their forces.
However, these two have great disagreements despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It can be a lot to talk that after almost three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they hadn’t even dealt with the matter.
The President of Turkey consciously avoided answering the question in relation to their disputes, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear understanding of where they can look for a common ground for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and considering the possibility of a full disaster when a NATO member fires down a Russian fighter aircraft, it is certainly better for two leaders to be again in talk intervals.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is reduced to the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand joined the bank’s international goals.
Since the bank collapsed almost eight years ago and had to save it, it has abandoned these goals.
During this time, the Bank’s strategies have used the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from the Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the foreground.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except for the main office and stock exchange listings will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use to customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of Inverness-shire for customers and staff.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become our investor brand and the employer of our employees, because we will now become much more a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will not continue sponsoring Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
It is now time for us to move towards the bank of brands, because basically (we have asked) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on customer needs, not our own, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Prediction and reaches 3000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win has a total of 3000 wins
The race rider Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone of the evening with his second victory on his home track as he competed with John Gosden’s prediction.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Triple master jockey dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: “This is special.”
I am very emotional because my family is also here.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because here I started 30 years ago.
It’s not a big event, this is not Royal Ascot, but a regular Friday night and 20 000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The detor absorbs comrades when he leads Prediction after victory.
Two racers have reached this milestone in obstacle competitions - championjockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with over 4300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers of the current era, and it is no surprise that she has reached this milestone, which only a few have reached before her.
She is elegant and strong, but her tactical asterisk separates her from the others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that she would have ridden 6000 winners if she wasn't just a jockey for weekend and big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is awesome to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for British competition, but besides that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a flying landing from the saddle.
From flight-stops to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
Heaps of wins at major races, including his famous ‘Magnificent Seven’ victory at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and suffered a ban on competition due to drugs.
Three years ago, he found it difficult to start when he returned after a six-month ban on competition, but he showed significant character when challenging the doubters and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin separates Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanovin
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly separated Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted insider for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a special representative in environmental and transport matters.
It was stated in the Kremlin’s statement that Putin has “determined Ivanov to move away from the duties of the President of Russia,” but he was not given a reason.
Ivanov's Deputy Director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia in 2012, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President’s protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as a head of state when it comes to drafting laws and managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that Vaino be appointed to replace him.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, operated the Soviet security service in KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a state television meeting with President Putin, both men argued that the chief of staff withdrawn at his own request.
But despite the smile on cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary election.
So, is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official argument that a man, once promoted as a potential presidential candidate, suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy, has been very suspiciously welcomed.
In his comments to Putin on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in the conversation to give me this very complex, even to say laborious, mission for four years.
Well, now I’ve been a staff manager for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the state security service KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the leader of the State Security Service FSB, which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second season of Putin, as Putin’s third season would have been contrary to the Constitution.
However, this task went to another of Putin's nearby allies, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister before his return to President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got a shoe after hitting the producer
Gibson was involved in a physical controversy last month at the scene of the series in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his separation in a joint statement.
Gibson, acting as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and quarrels at the scene.
I regret that it happened,” he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character is removed from the FBI agents team must be expected later.
54-year-olds, who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg Situation Comedy, have been in the series since its first season in 2005.
I love the Criminal Minds series, and I’ve given it all for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be with me until the end, but it is not possible now.
I just want to thank writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and above all the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the twelfth season of the series has been planned for September 28.
Mystery fish landed in the garden in Banff
A man living in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a vortex of water.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge Now Reaching Fife
A £1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017
The engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry’s crossing point as well as the land, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four locks between “cover fans” that are now about to complete the bridge around each of the three pillars.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It has 10 000 tons of steel and 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was among the first to walk from land to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historical and symbolic moment to build the Queensferry Overpass.
We all witness impressive engineering work in this project, where more than 30 000 tons of concrete and steel have been used alone to build this bridge section.”
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the landside and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precise dimensions must be matched.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the last part of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
When the last part of the road deck had been installed and combined with the expanding north pole road cover, we then had to close the remaining part from the north, i.e. inland.
This was done by pulling the northern fairway from the land in the direction of 700 millimetres south.
This was huge and at the same time a very demanding measure.
Huge, because the ground is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of about 3%.
Demanding, as the permitted dimensional deviations, according to which the team worked, were tiny, only a few millimeters in both directions.
Fortunately, however, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are “lucky when they are alive”
Three men are “lucky when they were alive” after they fell out of their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station made an alarm at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event evolve in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim in safety as their boats continued on their own.
We saw the boat swirling closer to the men and imagined the worst,” said Molefre’s lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones.
Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving,” he added.
The local fishing boat rescued two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from the buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken to a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “These three men who have come into the water are fortunate when they are alive and completely undamaged.
The boat's engine had a kill switch rope, but it had somehow disconnected the boat from the person who was driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectful hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have been worried that teenagers and children will no longer go out to play, but rather spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and take part in some action.
The display time was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and now recently to smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I refer to a craze called Pokémon Go, which is based on the characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they became a drawing set, playing cards and other follow-up products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had somewhat faded before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded servers.
Only in days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS, which after discovery can be “photographed” (with the help of a phone screen capture) or “caught”.
The generation who played the game at a younger age has joined the craze and jumped up from the couch to join the explorations.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the “average person”.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which follows 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game release, the number of people moving within 30 minutes of the day jumped from 45% to 53% for users tracked by Cardiogram.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees training level information.
The calls for many public health campaigns to ‘find 30’, ‘get up on the couch’ and ‘be active every day’ have made no difference because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who look unhappy.
However, exercise cannot be diminished.
Regularly moving people have a lower risk of cancer or depression.
The activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes, its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends as they hunt.
As usual, disapproving spoilers are looking for things to complain about here.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
And then?
There has been a breakthrough.
Although there were previously apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they didn’t give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The charm of novelty disappears and the use fades in time.
However, because of the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunters to be more active, in better condition, and healthier.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the public shock.
Simone Biles is the immune to it all.
Energetic in jumps.
Smooth with a boom.
Incredible with a pavement.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American Gymnast reached the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving a gap between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His overall score, 62.198, was clearly better than the silver medalist and teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
American Simone Biles at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to successively win the championship of the multi-match, and the fifth American champion in all, and at the same time he strengthened his reputation as the best of his generation, and perhaps all-time.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same class with other of the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
For the last three years, Biles has mastered the sport, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold, with programs that have been so astoundingly blended with ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the gymnast I saw best.”
The last test waited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of overexpecting expectations.
Return home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles from the United States, left, and Aly Raisman, after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, Aug.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he was the culmination of a national team coordinator, Martha Karoly, at the start party.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought of the future as he travels long to the top of his knowledge, it is not completely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - including his trademark volt bypass - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be great for the street next to Rio’s Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, was discovered by her coach Aimee Boorman’s mother while she was on her study trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a power factor.
He has not lost in a multi-match since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak continues as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the floor where Biles is the dominant world champion awaited.
He climbed to the top at boom points 15,433 and crossed them by getting 15,933 perma.
Raisman hugged him with goodwill as they waited for the final points - mere formality - and the tears rose in the glitter red, white, and blue eyes of Biles, when the dream of which he once wrote his scrapbook came true.
Raisman’s performance was some sort of reversion from four years ago when he was divided into a third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the renewal.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call “grandmother”, was clearly in charge.
He sent out flight kisses to the public after his permanto performance in a rush of emotion for a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
When it comes to Biles, this 19-year-old widespread tweeting this week gets a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial murder were shot while they were listening to music in the car
In the deadliest attack of Phoenix's first serial killer case last decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl sat in the car chatting and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police release published on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on 12 June.
The announcement states that the shooter who stood on the passenger side of the car fired a handgun up to eight times and then fled by another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple kill does not seem to have been the result of robbery, as the attacker did not take handbags or $2900 spent on another adult victim.
A representative of the Phoenix Police, Chief Officer Jonathan Howard, said that shooting was allowed to examine whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded by nine attacks in four months, which have been made mainly in two Latin-American districts.
These happen in the residential area in front of the home,” Howard said earlier this month to CBS’s subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as Nissan brown in the late 1990s, BMW black in the late 1990s and Cadillac white or Lincoln white.
Researchers have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that attacks are related and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was admitted to a hospital where he died later.
Liner, 31, and the daughter of Ellis, Maleah, died at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police brief on shooting, which took place only half an hour before the triple kill, and was targeted by an empty open-plan van, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Researchers found bullet sockets, bullet in the seat, and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-olds with microcephalia: “Situation becomes easier”
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed, as a result of a severe disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I can’t do this.
I can't do this.
I didn’t promise this.
What’s not true at all – of course I promised,” he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
My first reaction was that ‘I didn’t know that people were still doing it’,” Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walking rack.
Edmund did not sit or crawl as at the age of three, and he still does not speak.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
In addition, she loves to play with two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows how signposts invented by Edmund “singing to me.”
We teach him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary sign language - she says that Edmund has come up with some of his own signs.
Microcephalia can be caused by a variety of reasons: genetic, such as Edmund's case, or pregnancy virus infections such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load caused by an uncertain future.
I only asked what will happen.
What will happen?
And he still doesn’t know.
I haven’t actually asked for a forecast at times, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to actually give it to me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
The situation becomes easier.
You can believe that the situation will become easier.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana made the governor declare emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks and caused a wide flood threat due to extreme rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with the local authorities, and that help is already coming to the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, representative of the Governor’s Office for Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they would receive requests for tide vehicles, boats, and sandbags.
Steele said that the district of Tangipao alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood guard is valid until Saturday in a large part of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that the area is expected to have an additional three to five centimetres of rainfall.
In southern Alabama, the flood guard was in force on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a peak flood record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is lowering the flooding of Ascension County along the river as flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the state border of Mississippi in Liverpool, was at the highest level ever on Friday morning at nine.
The rescuers still pick up people from flood water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were on Friday near Glosteria among those rescued.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that the water in Beaver Creek, normally over 400 feet from his house, rose quickly during the night.
He says that the other stepson who lived near warned him.
We woke up, and the water just continued to rise,” said Hansford.
It reached all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the stream of water so high during the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family all have injuries, and that he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station, where the rescued people stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods “spread rapidly” as heavy rains continue, and that authorities plan evacuation regulations.
Krautmann says that one eyewitness near Livingston reports a rainfall of 13.75 inches between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country was completely impregnated by heavy rain, which continued until Wednesday.
The heavy rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of the Tagipahoa district from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS’s subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipao, a member of the City Council said that 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now under a flood.
Robby Miller, the chairperson of the district, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who were left surrounded by high tide.
Amite and Hammond cities have opened up shelters for those who have been evacuated.
They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water starts to fall,” he said.
In the city of Hammond, in the district of Tangipaoa, twenty streets were closed due to high tide, and the residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and stores.
The latest major flood here was in March,” said the city’s administrative authority, Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said that flat rain continued along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, a handful of houses were reported with flooding, but on the second Friday no flooding incidents have been reported.
Keith Townson, Director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and the rain is still going on.”
Filled with bullets, the six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia's shooting
The police report that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shooting in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that he was called Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown had multiple wounds on the groin, leg, hand and stomach, among other things, but he was aware when he was transferred to the hospital.
He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets,” the boy’s grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the son's condition is critical, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of the four shot people in the Germantown quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in a critical state; two other victims were in a stable state according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car together with the 29-year-old in a critical condition, the status reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police investigate whether either of the injured men could be a sniper.
Researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was a cross between several shooters.
The attack gun type sockets, which originated from various attack weapons, filled the venue.
It seems it was definitely a constant battle.
On the street were sockets on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it seems that there were several armed fighters here and that they were in an active battle,” said Anthony Ginaldi, Chief of Police at Philadelphia.
Several houses and transports in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and, according to the information obtained, the police are investigating the strips of the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, a girl, had a fallout hit in her hand on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simonea, Gabbya and Laurieta
Thus, I call this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, from America.
It has also established the presence of dark-skinned and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been Afro American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and the second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised him as an Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth American woman to have successively won individual gold in a women’s multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the peak of the sport, but the situation does not look like this in gymnastics halls across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie went all along the same path as Aly and Madison when they arrived at the Olympic team.
They are “Final Five” (last five) because there will only be four gymnasts in the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is Marta Karoly’s last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts mainly practice in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighbourhoods that can support the sport.
At these clubs, gymnasts get all their coaching, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles’ coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez’s coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and available gymnastics training to communities where numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15 000 urban youth (mainly black and latino) and have coached national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the hard work of the mind, discipline and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team's inspiration gets thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and it's awesome.
Participating in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious “girl power” by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Doctor Trainees Arranging New Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
The ministers had hoped that they would end the changes in the dispute by agreeing to an enhanced agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58 per cent of the doctor trainees who participated in 37 000 votes rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying that the NHS was on an “unknown soil” and that even minor delays will harm staff and patients.
The first doctor trainees will be transferred to a new agreement, which includes changes to nighttime and weekend work methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Doctor Trainee Committee, said last night in the opinion: “Doctor trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it accelerates the existing labour crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally.”
When the first group of doctors is transferred to the new agreement for only eight weeks, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced unwillingness to participate and from time to time deep silence from the government.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions, and take into account the concerns of doctor trainees.
If he does not do so, doctor trainees are ready to continue the industrial action.
At the end of April, the latest strike meant the postponement of almost 13 000 routine surgeries and 100 000 appointments, when nurses and consultative doctors were recruited to act as substitutes for doctors on the strike guard.
The ministers had hoped that they would end the dispute by agreeing to an enhanced agreement with the British Medical Association’s officers.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for those under the contract with 54,000 doctor trainees.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical interns so that they would not go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Every little or nothing can be achieved with industrial battles, but they put pressure on already demanding teams and services, and cause concerns, anxiety and disruptions to patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and Others, positively addressed their concerns about the role of Guardian Role and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive discussion on other important topics – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from Shabbat leave, education costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gaps in medicine – is a sign of the seriousness of employers, the Health Education England training organization and the Ministry of Health of November, February and May regarding respect for agreements with BMA.
Two pounds a day medication can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds of a day-paying drug after the authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant drug, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is administered already for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140 000 people get a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these get a second scene or stroke.
Cardiovascular attacks and strokes are caused by a fat that forms a stenosis on the artery wall.
If stenosis tears, it can cause blood clotting, which prevents blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can travel with the blood and break the bloodstream into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one scene have an increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca, which is sold under the trade name Brilique, lowers this risk by making less likely coagulation.
In today’s NICE guidance draft, it is recommended that people be given 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Notwithstanding the availability of effective progression treatments, even a quarter of people who have received a heart attack will later get another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating.”
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor along with aspirin is effective in calculating the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor - especially as regards the risk of bleeding - over three years are limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
Political correctness culture allows electoral evacuation in Muslim regions
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving an impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities has been disregarded, is revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles enacts police officers, electoral officers and city councils to ignore evidence of electoral fraud due to “racial and religious oversensitivity”.
The former Community Secretary, the current anti-corruption emperor, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set guard chains to protect voters who have been frightened outside the polling stations.
He recommends that voters should present a vote on a person when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say their name and address.
The report even suggests that the voter’s finger would be fitted with lossless ink so that no one could vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected,” says Sir Eric.
He or she will require the press to have wider access to the Council’s documents and decisions made by the informal committees or working group.
This would not only protect the local government from a broader culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with election fraud,” he said.
The Government commissioned the report as a result of the voting scandal of Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed as a result of numerous actions of corruption and illegality.
The court stated that Rahman’s “cynically distorted” religious feelings in his Muslim community and silenced his reviewers with accusations of racism and Islam fear.
Rahman is said to have “led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were speculative or the result was that a person votes with some other appearance.
Sir Eric said that evidence of fraud can be found throughout the country.
He was particularly concerned about the election evacuation, where high-ranking Muslim community members were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including proof of identity with ID
In his report, he said: “Provided evidence that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the elders, particularly in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
It was argued that ...state institutions had ignored such conduct because of the oversensitivity of the ‘politically correct’ race and religion.’
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean the system, which included prohibiting political activists to process voting tickets received by post in order to ‘collect votes’ to end.
The report, examined by Theresa May, also requires stricter checks on registrations in order to prevent the use of the election register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Review options for verifying the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person voting for the indestructible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic voting via mail.
Prevent political activists from dealing with the sounds and envelopes that have come through the post where the sounds are sent.
Let the police set guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for intimidation based on the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Turn photography into illegal at polling stations.
Insist that the polling stations only use English (except Wales).
Confirm the training to ensure that the staff adhere to the rule that the voter should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric marries the police forces of Greater London, saying that it is “amazing” that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets incident.
The election court was left behind by Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous corruption and illegal activities,” he said.
On the basis of numerous grounds, he was found guilty without doubt, according to the evidence threshold of criminals.
He also criticised ineffective ‘check-box checks’ at the City Council voting registration agencies.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s Tower Hamlets judgment was an alarm.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as a mother of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of election fraud, as well as denying the facts of certain groups, threatens this good reputation.”
Crazy Kate's bicyclist creature and other celebrity images revealed at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have been hit by the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive double character of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of his own famous twin being - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all of the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archery team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to the twin creature of Kate on a cycle path, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archery could be the star Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since he landed his images where he seems to be scary similar to the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, becoming aware of the excitement of social media, the archer admitted that since the child he has heard that he looks like Leo.
I don’t see a big consistency, but maybe in terms of my beard,” Brady told Huffington Post.
”He’s a good looking guy, so I guess this is politeness.”
One of the most popular comparisons of London from 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: the startling uniformity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The large, expressive eyes of Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina are said to be the double character of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia is for years compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actress Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova is more similar to actor Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and light hair, while the US team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of “Joseph Gordon Levitt’s sporty version”.
Hard women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, sharing the same face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presenting the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between a couple of similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed on the site their happiness that “other people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the football star of the United States and the actress of Dexter really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful wide smile matches Bring It On star Gabrielle with the smile of the Union.
CBC’s Olympic commentator apologises for saying that the Chinese swimmer “dead as a pig”
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of the women’s 4x200 freestyle message instead of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan was furious with CBC’s live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer “lost as a bad smell” and “dead as a pig”.
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200 meter freestyle message final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC’s commentary team to bring “color,” was heard saying: “That little 14-year-old from China was thumping, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.”
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam during the second part of the message 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers from all over Canada react quickly online after shocking at the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did CBC commentator just say China’s 14-year-old swimmer ‘did like a pig’???
The idiot did not realize that he was still in a live broadcast.”
Ai Yanhan in China was filmed in the women’s freestyle 4 x 200 meters message final as follows: “That little 14 year old from China was thumping, baby.”
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was tough and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn’t hold themselves back when they heard how disrespectful Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group. #housing.”
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologizeed in a live broadcast for MacDonald’s comment, saying: “We apologize that the comment on the swimming performance had to be submitted.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened.”
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times for people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copies and appends the apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had appealed to MacDonald for comments.
The TV company also quickly apologizes and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and sent live.
We quickly took action yesterday evening and apologize directly to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an unfortunate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for his message.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
I would like to apologize to this moment for the comment I made yesterday after the women’s message,” he said in CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.”
”It’s probably unnecessary to say that I didn’t mean it to be disrespectful, and that I’m really sorry.”
Primark’s customer was shocked by a woman who arrogantly fitted the underwear in the middle of the trade
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of the Primark shop to try out panties.
The fact that after assessing what he looked like in the pants, the woman peeled them off and put them back on the shelf was not improved.
He continued touring and finally fitted four pairs of briefs in a shop located in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where the woman fitted the briefs and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store, said that after trying the underwear, the mysterious woman “dressed again and walked away from the shop without buying anything”.
He said, “People did not believe in their eyes.”
The woman stood in the middle of the shop floor, took the pair of panties, undressed her own tights and underwear, and put on her reclined legs.
”He didn’t even try to find a remote place to fit, he just stood there shameless.”
Everyone stared, while he took off the briefs and clearly didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.”
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
”He didn’t seem to care who was watching – or thought of a person who would end up buying the briefs he fitted.”
Davidson, a 33-year-old living in Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone takes home a pair of briefs that someone else has tried but haven’t been cleaned.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I understood that the staff obviously tried to remove the clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is just good.”
It would be awful to go home with new briefs and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off, and they haven’t been washed.”
Primark’s representative said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone’s movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
How to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Krav Maga Federation Grandmaster Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to deal with rifle-waving robbers in close proximity.
Whether approached you from the front or back, this video shows you how to pay the attacker with the same length.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, you must first turn to see your attackers and “clear the line of fire”.
After that, you grab a gun between the forearm and the shoulder before hitting the attacker on the face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting the groin on the knee, and when the attacker goes out of pain, twist the weapon from his hands, strike him at the end of the weapon in the face, and back, keeping the weapon directed towards him.
If the armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the fire line, grab a gun and turn it around so that the criminal is not able to trigger.
At the same time, put weight on the weapon and strike the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon from his hold, retreat and point him at the weapon.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does this.
But remember that if you are not the grandmaster of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest places for a travel guide
British tourists have posed a serious challenge to their immune system and vomit reflexes by licking some of Europe’s dirtiest and most beating places.
Suffolk-based host and travel author Ian Wright, 51, licked the euro banknote, railing in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on the train’s toilet, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to get into.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called the imprint of inner force, yielded surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button of a train used by thousands of people may seem completely disgusting, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright constantly spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the preparation of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing of his arrow left him anything else in the mouth of bad taste.
Wright became known as his intestinal endurance tester as he traveled the world and ate strange and marvelous things.
From the rail rails of public railway stations, this task, extending to the flush button of the toilet seat, really tested his immune system.
In the film she said: “I’ve been quite carefree about my health since I was a child, and I’ve put all kinds of things in my mouth, starting with soil, worms, and mud water.”
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the filthy Russian public toilet.
In his sample there was a reading of more than 4000 units in the photometer.
For comparison, the number of freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet he refused to lick when the result of the photometer showed more than 4000 units, and the result of the newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler’s film, in the imprint of internal power, together with a Finnish dairy, Valio, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said: “This is almost the worst thing I’ve smelled in the toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I’m not going to lick anything because there’s a night out here.
On the trail of internal power was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilu, which contains lactic acid bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help boost human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Director of Valio’s snacks, juice and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the advantages of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air and ended up with the idea of ‘calling Ian’.”
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary film we can interestingly tell more about it to consumers.
I also think the documentary shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala added: “Let’s say it like this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, like the Russian stagnant toilet shown in the film, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I’m glad we got some of those dirty licks stored.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84% of respondents combined lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products with lactic acid bacteria.
Bug family destroyed rented house Cornwall in Saltash, before eviction
The buck family caused £50k damage to the rented house after being evicted by the terror of the neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of Cornwall’s property in Saltash after being complained of numerous times.
When they had been removed from the property by force, shocked housing company staff found the property to be in poor condition.
There had been gaping holes in the walls, floorboards had been torn, waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been wasted with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, owner of Cornwall Housing, said he was afraid the property cannot be repaired.
He said: “This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don’t think people should have to live this way.
Here are a lot of things to consider as this property is probably known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is inferior, and their name is inferior.”
The couple had three boys who lived in the property, and according to the police, the family had a ferocious street brawl with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, sales of drugs, and excessive shouting, quarreling and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease, received a decision on social behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under the demolition threat found old waste.
The property, from which drugs have previously been cared for, the floorboards had been pulled up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing evicted by force of the woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of time, 11 weeks, time to voluntarily change.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, “They didn’t care for anyone.”
We lived with them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We have seen the police here incredibly many times.
We didn’t sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
It’s wonderful now that they’re finally gone.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property
The garbage and old toys have been thrown down to the wild walls of the rental house.
He added: “It is a pity that the resident took no responsibility for his own and his family’s behaviour, as eviction is always the last method considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their deeds certainly terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as the courageous community members who provided us with information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send a message that anti-social behavior will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all twenty.
After the eviction, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
The housing company’s employees must now clean the waste stacks around the house
In 2014, the police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as scales, supplies and £ 1700 in cash.
Skeldon received fines after convicting B-class drug possession as a intention to distribute it forward.
He claimed that the money was intended for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partner live homeless after staying in private accommodation in Plymouth.
There were many graffiti on the walls of the rooms of the house.
The police say that they seek to evict residents who mock the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall police said that the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
This is a message for those who think that their behavior is without consequences, and for those who suffer from such behavior,” he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Travelers in Portugal were terrified when a military jet flew on a shallow shore
Sun worship tourists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft swept past really low
Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
Right now, terrified tourists started to panic as a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came almost to a contact distance from the sun worshipers on the sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, although they did not see what was coming from behind the clouds towards them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who published videos of a dramatic pass on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It passed twice on a really low level, and together it seemed like it was crashing down.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and really felt like the plane was falling on me.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air forces assured that no one’s safety was at risk.
This summer, wildfires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal, in addition to which four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to adverse conditions, smoke from off-road fires and thick fog
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Excoten first-half result better than expected
The South Karelian Social and Health District (Eksote) made a better result than planned in January - June of EUR 3.4 million.
Exote's result was EUR 4.3 million surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to decompose institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues for measures.
The exote covers the deficit that was previously generated by the surplus.
The excess from it may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Jaegers swore a military oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School swore a military oath on Friday.
On Friday at Immola, a military event was held for the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School.
The oath ceremony for the tenth special cross-border jaeger course was held on the garrison’s sports field.
The military oath was sworn by 70 conscripts.
Special Border Jaegers are trained in demanding border management, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve for 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for the special border jaeger.
For entrance examinations, 250 of them were invited.
Special cross-border jägers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting held in connection with the oath event involved five veterans of the war-time border forces.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A slate of robbery ahead - crime intelligence helps in investigating crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has been operating a RTA, i.e. a criminal investigation and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is led by a superconstal located in Lahti.
The Chief Executive is Commissioner in Lahti.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian person dedicated to computer science in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civil outfit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports to the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has acquired information about asylum seekers, among other things.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the most recent reform of the police’s working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. the fact that the police would run out less and less of the straw only when they receive an alarm.
With the help of the data collected and analyzed by the unit, daily police operations are targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, less than three national units, and each police department its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR centre, operating in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, manages operations nationally.
As the name implies, the PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Enquiry extends beyond your own area
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is the RTA unit’s task to know what is happening throughout the entire police department.
The inquiry also extends beyond the boundaries of one’s own institution, because it also commits crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, alarm task database and observations, the unit aims to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, prolific criminal offences or similar offences.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint can also be seen at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, a certain image of the author is formed.
Serialisation can be carried out either on the basis of the way of doing or on the basis of the person, depending on which of the police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not move around the city’s collars, but their work is not entirely public.
Both their own and the methods used by criminals are not reported because it could lead to professional criminals developing their operations and thus trying to prevent police crime prevention attempts.
The police will report on the methods in public if they predict that they will pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the marking of empty dwellings, which was reported in early summer and used in housing breaks.
In it, the workers put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape in the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents are really traveling.
The pre-trial investigation material is public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
For example, the clever ones will order a District Court minutes, which may indicate that fingerprints have been found in the place.
Next time, you go to the thieves with gloves in your hand.
Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppä from the Häme Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
In the background, the decrease in labour and financing volumes.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken already 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-renewal PORA, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects data from outside the borders of one’s own institution and Finland.
Schoolgirl Associated with Daddys from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the Isis, is rumoured to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasname Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this dead in Raqqa in Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in the Russian airstrike in Raqqa, which is the base of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning to escape from a country torn by war and return to Britain.
One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a gravestone and a testament to others that there are real risks associated with going to the war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
They told the Sultan family that the girl had married an Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow only after a few months.
Reid says Clinton considers Garland's Supreme Court to be a candidate if he/she is elected
President of the Senate, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republicans of the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mitch McConnell, Director of Senate Majority, says that the next president elects the deceased Supreme Court member of the person to replace Antonin Scala.
Reid said in a phone conference on Thursday that he predicted with “some degree of certainty” Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he hadn't spoken to Clinton directly about whether he would call Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garlandia and said that Clinton’s team wouldn’t want to “swim the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal in District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans that prevent Garland's appointment are the "conservants" and "possibles" of Donald Trump, the presidential candidate of the Republicans.
He said that Trump is not fit for office.
Treats says nude calendar is “for women as well as for men”
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they are going to find the next top model generation of their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The President of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his richly nude magazine differs from the old school Playboy because “Playboy is for men”.
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks that even the calendar is for them.
We have to start to show off the timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these nude female body images,” Shaw said in a press release where the calendar was announced.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Templates can leave images online or in person at open-access events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys plates?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fill in the comment section with irritated insults, written by the name of the name NoAllSingle-Middle-agedMen, note that this claim is based on actual information.
According to YouGov, the much talked about new album creation is not because more and more people born this millennium are excited about the novelty charm of physical objects, but rather about the longing for middle-age life.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely 45-54-year-olds.
In fact, the age group of 18-24-year-olds most unlikely to buy discs.
It’s not just about picking enthusiasts, it’s about the feeling: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (66% vs 66%).
But do youGov’s results come true?
If this blog was a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through the busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit, beckoning until I stop, forming a cup of my hands and saying something authoritative, like: “Let’s explore it more carefully.”
Let’s take a closer look at it.
At the same time, Soho’s charm and dirt are slowly removed – hotels, chain stores and office stores are now filling up buildings that used to have independent stores – a handful of great specialized record stores are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these stores trying to evaluate by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart, 55 from Glasgow, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and goes around the shops to spend a few hours.
I ask if he is a collector.
I guess I am,” he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 disks.
These discs that appear above (she sent a sample by email, I didn't follow her home), cover the walls of her living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of disks and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy disks that he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and unfunded.
Most of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, plates that were released when there were 11 or 12, and I was probably a little too young to buy them,” he says.
He agrees that album buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: “I won’t burn much and I won’t drink much.
This is my vice.”
Wez, a 25-year-old working at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit in with YouGov’s profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by the enthusiasm of the media, people who have heard that the plates have come into fashion again and have had the need to buy back their old plates.
Based on my discussions, people have got rid of their collection usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs back,” he says.
This can explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakens of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the plates?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be amazed by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar album covers; objects that evoke memories of teenage lucky days.
I think that sometimes it can be about filling the gap or some kind of comfort that owning things creates,” Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe that it is true for many people.
It’s an easy way to fulfill your thoughts.
”We’re like their social workers!” another employee suddenly said from the record pile.
The April ICM opinion survey revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a turntable.
This is where the news report is likely to look seriously concerned when browsing the stack of bossa nova collections.
This “award” aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who also works in the Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
Someone came in a while ago and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf’, he says.
This is not a big part, but this is definitely what happens.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a turntable.”
So not parents, but younger people, late teens who are just getting excited about it.
In Foppi, where nowadays almost a whole floor is reserved for vinyls, I have a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventies couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned movements - from the speakers a fresh Wild Beast's latest synth and sex-filled pop, and not improvisation jazz - is great to see a variety of customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but it’s difficult to prove a revolving psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes looking at the different plates for sale.
She is making window purchases, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn’t earn much, so disc picking isn’t really an option.
It’s expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on the computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” he sighs in love.
I don’t know how to explain - it’s really unique.”
My last stop is said to have attracted a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time as I try to look at jeans shorts, I observe a group of teenage girls who gather for a moment around Polaroid cameras before my father and daughter pondered about the purchase of the Crosley turntable.
On the left, there is a staircase with a wall covered with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, essential plates of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely “art vinyls”.
But considering that even the slightest attention these objects receive can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho’s depths for more, there’s not much to complain about here.
It does not come as a surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that uses the most luxury items, such as vinyls.
But even though my discovery suggests that youGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho’s record stores, they don’t exclude that large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores, and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They don’t really spend their mornings on Thursdays browsing through Berwick Street’s record stores and avoiding the eye of a creepy, 30-year-old TV presenter as he peers over the unsuspecting middle-aged men’s shoulders.
Holkeri is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Researchers say that the holster has a longer life span than any other vertebrate planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the harm, says that the record is on a female, whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years, which is five meters long.
French Court rejects application to dismantle trades from Jungle Refugee Camp
The French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle Camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary stores where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pennies), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office justified that the seats should be dismantled because they represent an unpaid parallel economy and are a risk of fire and cleaning.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a government-backed organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They justified that temporary shops and restaurants often offer protection and free meals for those who need them.
The court in Lille ordered that there are no legal grounds for eviction of the people who run 72 temporary trades, but said that the concern of the Calais prefect was ‘perfectly understandable’.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than feeding people who live in “extremely uncertain conditions”.
He said that the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the demolition threat was the Jungle Book Kids’ Cafe, which is a non-profit camp offering 200 meals daily, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s café.
A letter sent to Guardian stated that the closure of the cafe would ‘would be a disaster to these children, some of whom are only eight years old’.
On Friday, two charities, Help Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, estimated that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - high-end - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices drop significantly faster in Finland than in the EU on average
In Finland, food degrades sharply to the joy of consumers and the harm of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has decreased by almost five per cent in three years, while in EU countries, the price of food decreased by 0.9 per cent on average.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen to the second highest level in the EU countries that have the same wage level as in Finland.
Only in the UK has the price of food decreased faster than in Finland.
The information is provided by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager at Statistics Finland, who was published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared the real prices, i.e. the prices proportioned to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the price level in 1994.
The situation was alarming.
We were close to losing the price advantage that came with the EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed a turnaround, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now weighed down by the bans on imports of food imposed by Russia, which have caused food exports from Finland to Russia to stop.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products in the Finnish market has increased and the producer prices of agricultural products have decreased.
Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
The tightened price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price decline.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been shown as impressive advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not the location of inexpensive food, even though the price of food has declined a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland, with the same level of pay as in Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell the third cheapest food in terms of wage levels in Finland.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, we must halve the value added tax to the average level of EU countries and continue price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations with VAT percentage are indicative.
School is no longer quite its former
Those returning to the school bench may notice that the school has undergone a change during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline according to which all Finnish schools operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New instructions have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, the teaching of the fiction is abandoned, and instead, coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education begins to be read already in four.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
In this way, we try to make school more interesting.
The longest-lasting vertebrate found in the world - the ice shark can live up to 400 years
Also known as Somniosus microcephalus (Greenland shark), the ice shark reaches maturity only at the age of 150.
It can then live for 250 years, reports a new study.
The numbers make the sport the longest-lasting vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenlandic sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
As the pace of growth is slow, according to the follow-up, only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females who had been trapped in fisherman gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon timing of the eye lenses.
The average age of the examined sharks proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493 and 502 centimetres, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach their maturity by more than four metres, researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fires almost 300 - sellers are not reduced
Almost 300 employees will be dismissed from Stockmann’s department store company.
The joint ventures in the company that was run into difficulties ended at the beginning of August.
As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 workplaces will be reduced, most of which will be carried out as redundant,” says Stockmann in its press release.
According to it, the number of department store sellers is not reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, about 80 employees of support functions are offered new work as a seller.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3 000 employees.
At the start of these, the need for deduction was estimated to be approximately 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims at annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann’s difficulty in getting profitable from the department store.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the department store still makes a loss.
According to Stockmann’s acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," says Veijalainen in a press release.
The result improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of Lindex’ clothing chain.
The chain achieved its net sales and results for the second quarter of the year.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy Friday,” says Ilona Láng, meteorologist at HS.
There will also be rain showers in the middle of the country, but there will be a waterfall in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, you stay 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan athletics team shakes doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach’s campaign
The Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah appeared as a team athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP said that the athlete that Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan national team leadership, told him that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample as Rotichi in the surprise test.
The doping officials reported to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soin Anzrah was sent home, for he "did his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such use," said Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, to Reuters, the news agency.
The Olympic athletics begins on Friday, and Rotich is set to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences due to the case.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is a pre-Rio favourites.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah went on an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed that he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to be revealed," said the source.
Where are everyone?
Rio athletics stadium rubberizes its emptiness
Where are all right?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium following athletics.
On Friday in Rio, the struggle for athletics medals began, but the world’s top individuals were able to showcase their skills to an empty auditorium.
On Friday, Rio announced that only 58 percent of the first-day morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium stunned the cheering crowd.
Tickets for the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The lack of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazil’s medal wish at Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the stadium was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the 12 000-person stands were full of about 30 per cent.
It is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which struggles with financial difficulties, is far away from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get the football stadium fully drawn.
In the weekend, the organizers’ spokesman Mario Andrada told us that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
There are still 1.1 million remaining for sale," said Andrada, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets of the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to more than one thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, as organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240 000 tickets to lesser-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places in Rio Stadium in the morning.
Even a beach volleyball on the sands of Copacabana is not interested in the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There was plenty of people on the leaves.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically significant nature areas.
After that, private, business and corporations can redeem holders’ rights to land for money.
The foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to have a right of ownership against payment.
In practice, the holder is granted a veto over its 187-square-metre block, which means that not every holder is required to be approved if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holders can also be purchased for more than one block.
Obtaining a right of possession is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
There is no need to start carrying banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," says Juha Leviakangas, who has acquired the right of possession for his company.
The right of possession obtains precise location information from the block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the name of the holders of possession rights can be found on the same map where the group information for the land area can be found.
Levikangas sees that its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would somehow operate unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land areas either as a purchase or donation.
It mainly funds its operations through the sale of holder rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves are the worst in Turku – see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves are the worst hit by Turku by the biggest cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in relation to the number of residents than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bike theft reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated the amount of bicycles and parts of them stolen per thousand inhabitants in the ten largest cities in January-August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two bike theft per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
After all, that’s a big difference.
In other cities, the number of double thefts is proportioned to the number of residents," says Tommi Reen, Police Inspector at the National Police Board.
The City of Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to it.
The generality of theft can be influenced by the amount of bikes in the city and how many bikes there are in general," says Chief Officer Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the National Police Board, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bike theft goes largely depending on the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense city centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are at a distance from each other, and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In Finland, the police reported slightly less bike theft in January-August than in the same period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of a little more than 20 000 bike theft annually.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and only in Helsinki about 4 000 bikes a year.
They are in large numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a crime report on bike theft, although less than one in ten cases reported to the police survive.
A typical cleared bike theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught in his blood.
Cases can also be found in connection with other investigations, for example, when stolen bikes can be found in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly by the work itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from, for example, bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars in shopping centres, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja is most stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their own short-term use, for example, but most stolen bikes end up for sale, for example, online.
They remain on the domestic market.
At least the police have not known that stolen bikes would go abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some will probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a hidden crime or violation.
Alarm clocks should ring if a good condition bike is sold at a clear low price," Reen says.
Special librarian Severi Hirvi carries her colourful Nopsa to the shelters of Kallio Library in Helsinki for the duration of her work.
He has had five wheels, but none has been stolen," says the moose. "It has never been taken, it has been a good monk."
Perhaps this may not attract thieves, there may be no hipster value here," says Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who has quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike stumped against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks its bike into something fixed, such as a bike rack.
There is a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, which the frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
All the time you hear from your friends that the bikes have been taken."
Mostly bad bikes, such swarthy Jopas."
A bike was stolen from Valve itself from the housing company’s courtyard a year ago.
However, the bike had not been locked, so Valve could wait for it to be stolen.
Children under the age of 15 are responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki experiments with US-known peer-to-peer whale crews
In Helsinki, so-called peer-to-peer jury is tested to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the trial applies to children under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal responsibility.
The P2P crew is missing the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer jury discusses the incident with the offender and imposes a sanction.
A week later, the offender can join a peer-to-peer crew to make up for their actions.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Affairs, says that the model is not tight.
We have other mediation models that are used side by side.
All guides the young person in a more responsible direction so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model has been introduced for the P2P crew in the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person does not come in front of the adult panel, but reflects on the events with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service design agency Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, says that it was a assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of children under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
It’s been a message to keep on the road of your choice,” says Lovio.
The Peer-to-Peer jury is part of the Helsinki project for immigrant youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to all those in need, not just young people.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a sketch of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, President of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party’s money to be directed to the congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
We believe that the dissensions caused by Donald Trump and his disregard, incompetence, and record unfavorability threaten to bring the voice of democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning the Trump decorative anchor around their neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are reduced day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the prominent Republican against Trump Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect the majority of the Congress" and is not a support for anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump’s actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton Promises Relief for U.S. Children
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton shared the details of his economic policy on Thursday evening.
I wanted to be president so that the US economy would go well for everyone.
Donald Trump strives to be president in order for the economy to go well with his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
Clinton’s plan is centered around a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly through private money.
The construction program is a hand-stretch for American job seekers who suffer after factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in upscale jobs after World War II.
We are a builder nation, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded otherwise from Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it must pay the tax at source, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
[as President] I am against all trade agreements that work against employees or salaries," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton was planning to rate the Republican economic program announced on Monday by Donald Trump that it "comes only such millionaires".
Trump’s proposal for a rebate to corporate taxes Clinton has previously appointed “Trump’s loophole”.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of clothes that Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making himself products in America," Clinton staggered.
These are Rio’s spectator numbers: The races haven’t glued to Finnish squares, but the mobile app is of interest
Normally, sports competitions appear as sharp peaks in TV viewer statistics.
The Olympic Games in Rio have not yet reached a huge number of spectators.
At the same time, the races have glued 12 per cent of the population to the squares: the swimming on the Tuesday evening was followed by 615 000 spectators from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Athletics Championships for one month ago attracted nearly 800 000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over another million.
For the time being, most of the Olympic sports have been interested in Sunday evening cycling and the fifth day opening gymnastics, both of which reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Head of Sport at Yle, is pleased with the viewers’ figures and reminds that the viewers will be distributed at the Rio Olympics for the first time on several different instruments.
In addition to the TV, Finland will also follow the Olympics in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers choose the Olympics in general.
On the TV side, viewers also share with TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions for which Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20 000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a diluted interest - if someone now considers it to be diluted - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the early races, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other interesting sports in Finland: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, viewer numbers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store in the first days of the competition.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150 000 times.
I would bet that we are already going around 200 000 downloads.
We will only get the viewer numbers for the network later", Pokkinen says
The Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and faults have been fixed.
There has been a delay and other technical problems with the use of the Rio Arena in the early stages.
The apps have updated versions that should fix errors.
Rio’s Olympics are seen more widely on Yle’s channels and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be watched from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Speech transmits competitions daily.
The Olympics are perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, as well as the last ones that can only be followed from Yle’s channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports will be visible both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Lake Päijänne, which is 95.3 metres deep in Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square meters in Ristiselkä, the bottom of which was shown to be 104 meters deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried to unnecessarily strengthen the observation by sounding.
The method may not find a small recess in a hundred meters,” says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Lake Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi reach over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
There might well be unknown depths," says Kannela.
If the deepest lake is determined by the medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
As a result, Päijänne cannot reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 14.29: Fixed the last paragraph where the deepest lakes in the middle depth were wrong.
Admirable from the tax depreciation: Taxation of pensioners continues to tighten
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of wage earners.
The admirer says that the maladministration came out under the parliamentary elections, and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal in relation to employees.
This is not included in the proposal of the Board of Directors.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises given should be able to follow after the election, he says to Lännen Media.
At the beginning of this year, the wage earners received deductions that reduced taxation.
The matter was heated up by opposition representatives in Parliament, who charred the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbia (National Coalition Party) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy proposed by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing wages next year.
He says that a tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is satisfied with the message of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Orpo with the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been achieved with great effort.
He says that it is important for credibility to adhere to the agreement..
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It is made by labour market organisations, so it should not be questioned.
It comes in handy because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people’s own future faith.
Seizure of prolonged unemployment in the barn
Ihalainen appeals to the government to seize long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was about 17 000 more than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of increasing the employment rate to 72% is running away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish victims reportedly in Thailand
In Thailand last night and yesterday, at least four people died of bomb attacks in Finland.
The Embassy urges Finland to be familiar with the country and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Very little Finnish in Thailand
According to Westphalia, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled to be at the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bomb attacks.
The Embassy has tried to seek information on the situation of the city especially among Finns in Hua Hin.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalia.
No information about the author
According to Westphalia, there is no information about the perpetrator yet.
The Ambassador thinks that events may be related to the political unrest of the divided Thai society and the recent referendum on the constitutional status of the military junta.
The law was approved in the referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who announced their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict associated with the Muslim population, Westphalian says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, the impacts have not been extended to tourist destinations.
There is a big, local holiday in Bangkok today,” says Westphalen.
According to him, the city celebrates the queen’s birthday and mother’s day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The impact affects the course of the day so that the authorities are very precise about safety.
Thai police: Strikes do not involve international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also ruled out, says the Thai police according to the news agency AP.
During the day, at least four people have died in Thailand, as 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as popular with tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in a tourist destination popular with Finns, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says Thai magazine Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs exploded according to the magazine at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the magazine, one person was wounded.
Popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, on the other hand, has exploded four bombs in total, according to local authorities, yesterday and today.
At least one was killed in both double bomb attacks.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in Surat Thani Village and Trang City.
At least one person died in both strikes.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many travelers as it is used to take you to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Koh Tao Holiday Islands.
Not known as the perpetrator
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, leader of the military junta in Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn’t incite people to panic more,” he said to the journalists.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least Hua Hin and Trang’s shocks are interconnected.
He told Thai BSB that the intention of the creators has been to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist sites.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finland to be familiar with the country and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalian.
In wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the Finnish night.
A bit more information has been available about the attack last night in Hua Hin.
There died a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded there are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin’s second blow.
Two bombs exploded as an attraction near the well-known bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes that it has found another bomb.
The Surat Thani bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the governor of the province.
In the blow, a municipal employee died.
There is at least one wounded.
A police officer interviewed by CNN says that two bombs were also used in Surat Thani’s attack, which exploded every half hour.
According to Bangkok Post, bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won the women's four-way match
Alexandra Raisman from the United States was second to 60.098, and Alija Mustafina from Russia was third to 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for stand-up championships in Rio with perma, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to a large extent in recent years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the championships of the four-match and the floor three times in a row, as well as the boom last and the second year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two world championships in the team.
There are fainter World Championship medals at Biles from the jump and boom.
Thailand’s Finnish entrepreneur: “Strike has no impact on tourism”
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children’s play club in the same property in Phuket, Thailand, has not been worried about the impact of bomb attacks on tourism.
If there are no more impacts, I do not think that this will result in any more miracles, as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia, evaluates the Villa that worked for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many tragedyes that have tested Thailand.
There is always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If even these former have not expelled tourists, it is hardly this either.
The company’s office is located a few hundred meters from the place of explosion.
The villa heard of the blow from its own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said it is not worth coming to the office.
The villa says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed due to shocks in the early morning.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought road closures had been put on account of the queen’s birthday,” Huovila says and refers to Friday holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was peaceful and the shops of the main street were allowed to open at about ten o’clock local time.
On the beach, many had not even heard of the shocks.
Half-three days in Thailand, Patong had normalized traffic and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the impact, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who has visited the impact site.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was lit.
The scout found two men who were fit for the tactile signs hidden in the nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other went away, but the man was later found in the forest with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of using a motor vehicle for theft, theft and gross damage.
The police would like to thank those who gave tips.
Director of Research on Russia’s leadership changes: Clear shifting aside
On Friday, Russia underwent the highest-ranking change in leadership for years when President Vladimir Putin separated Sergei Ivanov, head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, an Estonian-born 44-year-old.
He is an ex-diplomate and is the secondman of Ivanovi.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from gaining too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of leadership is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from gaining independence from the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been subjected to friction with other executives or screwed up.
Drive drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s insider, will move on to special environmental and transport tasks.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the change was a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other positions and proposed that Vaino be replaced,” said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very important in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the President’s Security Council.
During the Soviet era, Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old curve, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov’s place is that Putin changes his immediate circle to be younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn’t aim for them,” said Sherfan Darwin, representative of the Manbiji Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were exported to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took possession of about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to the Isis.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Fixed the previous news at 19:30: In the past, we misrepresented that civilians were fleeing from the city, really the Isis fighters captured civilians as they fled from the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document publication policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on the publicity of documents is illegal,” says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority’s own guidelines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanomat for the Minister of the Interior’s events.
The Minister justified the decision with the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry’s Communications Department says to STT that the Ministry has identified a need to renew its practices.
Usain Bolt’s last Olympic show starts in Rio
Like in recent years, Bolt has run against time under the ranks.
He insulted his backs at the beginning of the season and had to skip Jamaican Olympic competitions.
This has not been a complete preparation, but I am in much better condition.
I have practiced well and it is a key issue, Bolt said in his press conference in Rio.
This press conference included low-clothed samba dancers and journalists who have turned into fans.
Around Porina Bolt, it underlines that the Jamaican star has risen in the era of athletics struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens 2004, when he qualified for 200m in early stages during 21.05.
Back then, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, crushing the world record and the competition’s self-confidence in spite of the final celebrations of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later at the Berlin World Championships, Bolt reached his career with a legal point at the clock.
The world records of 9.58 metres and 19.19 two hundred are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds below, but no one believes that it will be born except Bolt himself.
At Satasella, Bolt’s challenger is Justin Gatlin, the Olympic champion of the 2004 century in Athens.
Last year, at the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost in the finals of the prestigious races if only he has been on his way.
In Daegu in 2011, the World Cup final of 100 was not running from Bolt due to misconduct.
Bolt turns over after a week 30.
He is an old man in the sport of young men, and the Rio races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has placed the next year’s World Cup in London as the last finish line of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from others.
I am older and this is more difficult.
But whenever I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to China’s state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
There were traces of prohibited substances in the doping sample of the Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with indications of the epoch hormone.
He finished fourth in Rio in the 100-metre women’s butterfly.
According to the Brazilian magazine Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Sports Petitions Court CAS.
Xinhua says that a specimen given by Xinyi on Sunday could have been found in a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female fluid runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with indications of the epoch hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has passported Rio as a athletic coach home due to doping.
The International Olympic Committee (KOK) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had completed the test as an athlete and had given a doping sample on behalf of him.
According to media data, it is a Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich race pass.
Phelps doesn't stop anything - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps from the United States swims in a 200-metre mixed swim in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same sport of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps’ win time was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was placed second in a mixed swim before the Chinese Wang Shun.
I’m just trying to have a little fun, BBC’s Olympic swim commentator Helen Skelton laughs at Iltalehti’s quick interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on this week’s Iltalehti website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not stress much if there is a slight noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
There is visual media, he emphasises.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress with at least enough revealability - for the eyes of at least many conservative British spectators.
However, there are no rear steps.
It’s important to look good, and the little ghastly are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to tint and perhaps startle, but he emphasizes that he doesn’t want to play the main role.
This is not about me," he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It should not matter so terribly how I dress.
Can you imagine that the stir has reached Finland?
I can’t, but everything that pays attention to how these swimmers are doing things hard and how big a sacrifice they are making is ok for me, Skelton grinnes.
Do you know what?
It is a stir from scratch if it comes from the dress (the presenter).
I am a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests due to suspicion of terrorism
The Rio police announced on Thursday that it has arrested two people due to suspicion of terrorism.
The police carried out arrests in connection with the safety control of the competitions.
The police carried out five other arrests at the same time and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, people arrested due to terrorism belong to the same group, whose members were arrested by the police already in July.
Detained persons are believed to have links with the ISIS extremist organization.
The arrested had reportedly incited violence in social media.
Messages about violence had been distributed, among other things, in the popular WhatsApp service.
85 000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blasted a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place in the public.
The police let the audience in after having blasted the package in a controlled manner.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics, when the police have completed a controlled blasting mission.

Argentine dame burst out of Petäjä-Siren - Finnish ponder protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren experienced hard on Thursday.
The Argentine dame packed Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening start of the women’s surfing day.
Winds were broken clearly.
The opponent granted the violation.
He was stuck because of a crash, and the others ran away," said Joakim Wilenius, head coach of Finland.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It wasn’t worth doing because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped into the water to get a refund, Petäjä-Siren said.
Finnish hanged on his board until the last because he didn’t want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
With the crash, Finland was ranked 27th.
In the overall situation, the London Olympic silver medalist of 2012 is the eighth.
In terms of tip, the crash didn’t have much impact.
On Friday, it’s an important day when you race to leave 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first data, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that according to science prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring extra years into a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person cannot influence can bring him/her extra years.
These include tendencies in middle body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your age.
You don’t always have to work out – just picking up a milk can is enough.
The secret of a long age has been studied in many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
Harvard University research found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death", especially with neurological or cardiac diseases.
Alcohol, on the other hand, is the cause of studies, according to which moderate use - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of floss can extend a person’s life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway examined how laughing affected a person’s life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were more concise people 35% more likely to live after the experiment ended.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition to everything, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years of life, he or she should also have an orgasm.
Of course, exercise will bring extra years, it will not be disputed.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute shortness.
One study from the University of Oxford found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
There were also more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it’s an athlete who has won medalists at the Olympics or an actor who won Oscar, he is more likely to live beyond the usual bun.
Many research has tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring to his life for extra years.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that a long age is due to a person’s social status – which, on the other hand, enables, for example, the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study on shopping behaviour in people over the age of 65 found that a person who shopped every day was probably less likely to be the parent of a person who shopped.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring about death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping therefore does not have the same effect.
Intoxicated drunk driving fell into the truck
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car frontal collision took place in Koskela, Southwest Finland.
An accident occurred in Koskela, mid-koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left in its lane, but it was lit up.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car fell into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
The woman, who transported a passenger car in 1972, was left in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the women’s blow test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Posti sends loose candies to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket’s selection of loose candy was lacking because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candies from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulk confectionery, because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We get more when Posti gets delivered the load!
So, if there is no congestion with lawn mowing, the sign read.
The retailer’s foxing sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include grass cutting as well.
Lawnmowers are available at Posti until the end of August.
According to Haltia, the sign was mostly amusing and he decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update struck me a little bit.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia’s update had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites to grab in a loose candy bag, even though a few of the glasses were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of Posti’s Corporate Transport, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five pallets went to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) yesterday and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloo) to three, but today we only took five pallets, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
Ilta-Sanomat first reported on the matter.
Teija Haltia was not indignant with the sign because she found all her favorite loose candy in the selection.

Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos as a result of life change.
Lotta shared a picture pair of her changes on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was in fitness training and aimed for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his weight loss contract already in 2009.
He is a comprehensive lifestyle change and has gradually lost thirty kilograms.
On Friday, Backlund published a picture pair on Instagram.
The picture shows how huge Lotta has changed over the years in terms of appearance.
The photo pair of Backlund before and after has collected several thankful comments from fellow slimmers.
You are wonderful.
We are on the same journey, motivation hard! one anneals.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's do it now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when the sky itself is on the same journey, the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilograms with the Let's do it now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to get to a normal weight, which was then ten kilos.
During the three-month course of fitness, five kilograms eventually fell.
The wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the 42-year-old family of a woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered for the police dog work instead of flowers and adresses.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoon Eläinlääkäriasema and also completed their nursing training there.
The vet clinic remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous and unafraid of work.
Good Friend.
Still, we can’t fully realize that he’s gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to the police dogs in full, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Loviisa’s Koskenkylä.
A woman’s neighbors have said that the victim to Iltalehti was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old suspected of murder did not know a woman, nor did they have any connection with each other.
The police dog Börje was involved in the murderer’s follow-up, which was wounded life-threateningly in a detention situation.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court gave Posti a ruling on an infringement of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to withhold the wages of an employee who refused to introduce the leased employee, assesses the district court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay most of the retained salary to the employee and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the instructor’s salary, which corresponded to the part of the orientation of the entire day’s work.
According to the District Court, an employee was placed in a disadvantaged position on the basis of their trade union activities in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the Union of Postal and Logistics PAU’s organisational decision on the prohibition of induction.
During the November letterbox last year, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees will not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who violate the strike.
First, the People’s News reported.
Turkey’s return to a path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and respect for human rights development, write to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in his response to the Finnish Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his earlier letter, the Finnish Association of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns for freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and expression to Turkey.
Putin separated the manager of his administration - replaced by an Estonian-born Persecution
President of Russia Vladimir Putin has separated Sergei Ivanov, Head of Presidential Administration, says Kreml.
The place will be replaced by the grandson of Soviet-Estonian communist leader Karl Vaino Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Vice President since 2012.
Persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says the news agency Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
According to the bulletin of the Kremlin, Ivanov, a member of Putin’s close insider, moves on to special environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed Vaino to replace him,” says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in the espionage of the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President of Putin in 2012 before his re-election.
BBC: ManU giant ban - not seen in the Premier League opening
The world record player for soccer moves will not be seen in the field when the Premier League kicks off in the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed with England.
Manchester United’s giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the side as ManU opens its league season on Sunday against Bournemouth,” said BBC on Friday.
ManU paid EUR 105 million for Pogba to Juventus, according to the British media.
However, the English football association FA keeps him away from the game, as he was banned from Juventus.
He received two warnings in the last season's Italian Cup, and it becomes a single-match ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pogba’s next seam to play is the league’s second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, madness is virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival’s position as an internationally acclaimed event starred by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial turf and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just be the main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The result of success is a simple question: What kind of event would the creators themselves want to go to?
It is quite different in event productions that we think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow will sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors of 70 000 last year by 5 000 people.
This year, a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists will be seen at the festival.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because activities must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled in huge fairways.
We don’t want it.
Over the course of 13 years, the idea of a successful event has been inflated so that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area decorated partly with artificial turf.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year the venue will be a tent for 15 000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I’m a bit mad, but at the same time we’ve been able to preserve Flow’s spirit.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done on the rock is that even today big visions are practically possible.
In the early 2000s, the operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of approximately EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was about EUR 6 million.
It can also be used to create "crisis things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
However, fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge group of fans in his genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was being booked because now is probably the last time he is seen on a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what is played on a commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he has done damn good gigs in recent years.
Thailand tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists escaped in terror
On a Thursday night, two bombs exploded in Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died in the blow and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blasted with mobile phones.
The bombs were located on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, said police representative Samoer Yoosumran according to CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector who lived in Asia, tweeted a much-speaking image of the attacks.
If the TV is not displayed properly, you can see it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The crowds ran against me and said that the bomb has exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning local time exploded two bombs in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which is also popular with Finns.
No one is known to die.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was made in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang City.
The police reported that they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bomb attacks that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently tapped into the activities of criminal organisations engaged in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new armed forces leaves for wartime first
In the event of an acute war, conscripts are ordered to fight only after several months of the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to the Chief of Education of the Finnish Defence Forces interviewed by the magazine, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, for example, those who serve for 5.5 months in a military situation are only able to fight at the end of their training.
According to the Head of Education, reservists are first assigned to the service.
No conscripts or reservists are ordered to complete a task that has not been trained, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training conscripts in the units of immediate readiness from next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola got giant reparations from a mold house
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a tough dispute about the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After the transaction, however, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused harmful microbes to be present to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in dismantling condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction there from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both district and court court.
The Court of Appeal delivered a judgment in the case on Wednesday.
It held a judgment in the district court in which the seller was ordered to pay a price reduction of EUR 150 000 to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller must pay the couple’s legal expenses and liquidation expenses in a total of EUR 47 344.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because some need to repair the apartment had already been known to buyers when the apartment was being sold.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the errors in construction were significantly more serious than had been presented.
Tola is looking for a home in good condition
Tola told at the Court of Appeal that the couple had been looking for a home in good condition, because they did not want to take up repair work.
He had realized that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the factors mentioned in the condition check report were not harmful.
The condition inspection report was mentioned as risks and shortcomings in ventilation, and the fact that the management of rainwater and melting water flowing along the rock surface is not sufficient.
However, the discussions did not reveal that it would have been a matter of any kind.
Tola and Waroma came to the idea that rainwater from the rock should be controlled a little over a few years.
Shops were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
In the inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013, microbes were found, which, according to the evidence, were caused by both the rainwaters of the rock and the soil moisture that has risen in capillaries.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector, also enter the interior through the porch.
A sample of mould or yeast that crosses the limit values of health risk was found in the utility room, the basement staircase, the window bay in the living room and the basement washroom.
Terraces built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision prior to the sale, according to which changes had been made to the apartment in violation of the permit.
Among other things, the terraces were built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as it was and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no special reason to carry out a larger inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their accountability, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children in Nazis - in the register also Finnish
Editor Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article of Dagens Nyheter how the National Archives in Maryland, USA has recorded a total of 218 500 women on microfilms, who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also US, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted Nazi brides.
The documents and register cards originate from the Nazi-Germany breed agency.
The breed agency was head of SS Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same applied to even greater numbers of women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women underwent gynecological examinations to investigate the matter.
The Finnish Heritage Agency examined women’s backgrounds, for example, by studying church books.
The aim was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women’s family tree.
Women also had to be willing to give up their Swedish nationality and give the breed agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The breed agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving", "savvy", and "good national socialists" who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS male brides.
The article does not explain how 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-backed program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not actively promoted, the U.S. Holocaust Museum website explains.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and support for the acquisition of children.
The honorary cross of the German mother was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum website states.
Petäjä-Sire's sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first race of Finnjoll’s day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained as a group of tails at the second race of the day.
In total, Nikko rose to eighth place after five leaves, but the failure of the second left dropped him to 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in the RS:X-class day start positions 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were numbered 23 at the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded for a couple of hours with a night’s sleep: “I was so in the cake”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship barman to the tango king of 1995, to the best-selling solo artist in Finland and star of the dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää is still struggling and he is currently on a wild rise.
A book by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - "Paljana" was published today on Thursday.
In Sillanpää, Sillanpää talks about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää’s career rose to a total ascent when he won the tango king’s crown on the Tango Market in Seinäjoki in 1995.
Sillanpää sang tangos in the competition, but he had already planned a bit of different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a piece of tango for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finland’s music history.
In the book, however, the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had had a party in the evening.
I was so in the can!
Sillanpää remembers the book.
It would not be immediately understood from the recording of a huge hit that it was sung in a hangover.
Although I was not physically at my best, the mark was still good.
I learned that there is no need to demand the perfect and the top of it all the time.
Another accident related to the most popular songs of a man, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time and the case finally ended up in the texts of the song You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book states that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmänen were not as Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells the real story of his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true, but based on the news of 7 days.
In the news of the magazine, Jari’s and ex-favorite resignation was due to his excessive partying and alcohol use, but according to Jari, it was a full bunny and did not keep it true.
According to the book, Jari played in a furious record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good so.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of the voters voted in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polling week’s opinions predict the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in terms of staying in the EU.
None of the prestigious research institutes or universities flags the difference, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the slogan "It's the economy, stupid" of the recent election campaign of former US President Bill Clinton flew the scrap guide in the British Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Financial curl language
In its latest monthly survey, Centre for Macroeconomics provides answers to Brexit disasters.
The most typical answer is that no economists were listened to because this time the voters made a decision on non-financial grounds.
One explanation for economic loss is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it is out of the right British.
Many also have the idea that a decrease in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the unanimity of the economists did not come up enough.
In particular, they were denied the equality of the BBC, which gave as much space as two per cent of the EU’s economics representatives from the economists as to the overwhelming majority.
IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE are not interested in the EU-minded press, and other economic combinations of power as to the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened and understood, they were not conveyed, because the economists represent an elite with which the voters feel that they do not share common interests.
The academics of cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The ultimate profit argument for the Brexit vote concerned immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will congested your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments tricked.
There are foreign employees in each café.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre you can see immigrants.
How much easier would the British get doctor’s appointments if they were not?
Every school has children from immigrants.
How much easier would the children of the right British get to school if they were to get rid of?
Foreigners live in each municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they disappeared?
I think these are economic questions.
They apply to jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists did not succeed in responding to them and, if successful, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer queues for health centres, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants – and especially EU immigrants – are the net payers of the British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepared for Brexit for Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up the A and B plans.
Plan B, or the victory of a camp that pays out the difference in the EU, began to be prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in case the result would be leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We started to increase our cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen, the only open-ended real estate fund in Aberdeen that the news related to on a daily basis.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The fund was worth £3.5 billion at the time.
In total, the value of the company’s funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen from all the open real estate funds of the British real estate funds.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained ten per cent or even below it.
Thus, real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the camp to win the EU withdrawal won, Europe got confused.
However, the two weeks following the voting in the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of Mark Carney, Director General of the Bank of England, in which he estimates that Brexit could pose a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trading.
Together, they blinked and put the matter in the main headings of Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and after the fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen’s situation was good due to the cash raised, but it also had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trading, but changed pricing down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether money should now be withdrawn in panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it wouldn’t be worth it because it would cause losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of the reports were cancelled.
Since then, the market has been quite steady, and now the market has been very peaceful for a couple of weeks,” says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen’s mainland European funds.
However, there were a lot of surveys.
Unreasonably attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate funds received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open-ended funds affected by closures account for about four per cent of the UK real estate.
Aberdeen’s lockdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 of its properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
This week, Aviva Investors warned its investors that it might hold on to its fund for 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been pushed down, but the situation does not seem to be more "crazy" for Aberdeen.
The biggest issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors,” Vanhanen points out.
The price of pounds and dollars is at its lowest for 30 years, in addition to which there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought minuses to the London real estate market
For two in the morning, the situation did not look very strange yet.
But from four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, re-awakened to see the outcome of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
A word of power came in.
I realized that this is going to Plan B now,” says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed to work at once.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the morning.
The TV screens, which were normally silent in the office, supported the news, and usually the loud crowds were completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to tell about his difference.
When the market opened, the display terminals blinked only red.
It was such a morning that you would never have thought you would live,” says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions on Midsummer after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had prepared for the option well, and therefore the situation was kind of peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote started repair shop
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, the British management went for an exchange.
Strong declines were anticipated in the UK and especially in the London real estate market.
In the coming years, up to 20 per cent of the minuses were anticipated in London’s offices.
Soon, a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty continues to roar in the air.
However, it does not appear to have spent its last summer holidays in Helsinki this week on the face of Vanhanen.
He thinks it’s too early to say a lot about what’s going on with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the London real estate market has already been obtained.
The real estate service company CBRE’s information on price development covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the office buildings of City of London, 6.1 per cent of me accumulated, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not that terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equally large drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
According to Vanhanen, the parable is not quite relevant, as it is now a home-made crisis in the UK.
The atmosphere is different too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity,” says Vanhanen.
You can find financing as usual.
The repair shop could have been ahead anyway
In fact, the price correction movement is no wonder about him - it could have been ahead without Brexit as well.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of real estate in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have said for two years that City and especially offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have been on the rise for four reasons, Vanhanen’s list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is being globalized,” Vanhanen says.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
As a well-known city, London is an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which has led to pension companies seeking returns on new projects, for example.
The loan has been easily available on top of this – although the leverage has been used clearly less than during the 2008 crisis boom, according to Vanhanen.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, prices stabilised last summer,” says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also started to lighten its holdings in London, and last year it was a net seller.
There was a sort of turn to wait, and now it came.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops,” says Vanhanen.
Not much he dares to estimate the future, but he says that there is hardly any spike to rise.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a descending or even going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And still he is an optimistic who believes that the pits will be cleared by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global diversification.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of its victim.
If you have diversified, the risks are also decentralised, says Vanhanen.
S Group starts to register purchase information more accurately than before
The S Group knows what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it was starting to collect even more detailed information about the purchases of its loyal customers.
So far, when the information has been collected on the final receipt, the group will begin to pick it up at the beginning of May also from the purchased products.
The S Group comes after Kesko, as the data on goods purchased with a Plus Card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and is used with permission for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Quite a few customers have prohibited the use of product information, says Riitala to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group’s registration change.
According to food purchases alone, Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing for the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and this is not planned.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty programme, which can be joined in Valintatalos, Siwa and Euromarket.
We do not currently collect product- or category-level information, we keep a record of the final amount of the receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day and the final amount of the customer’s receipt.
We haven’t gone to that level as K Group or S Group,” says Anu Ora, Commercial Director.
According to him, the aim is to renew the loyalty programme in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell you later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially a trial
SOK’s customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address information, basic information has also included occupation, education, form of residence, years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their role have also been registered.
The purchase date and time, place, total amount of purchases and payment method have been saved from the S-Etukortti purchase.
In addition, S bonus partners’ information has been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, in S-markets, Prisma, Kodin Terro and ABC-chains, the data is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of SOK’s Customer Ownership and Partner Operations.
S Group says it informs its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the information is stored at checkouts in any case, whether or not you want it.
Anyone can check their stored data on the S Group’s website.
For example, the funds cannot access the data, emphasises Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is the newest dog confirmation from Customs - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black laborator’s puppy is keenly sniffing five boxes in the same row at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing it with its favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of powder gas-smelling sockets was uncovered.
Powder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce access
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also be taken to other border crossing points and ports if necessary by Heila and Suntio.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The impact of Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs and, after the impact, supervision has been confirmed, says Mikko Grönberg, Senior Inspector at Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun dog and explosive dog in Customs’ duties is postal consignments through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal consignments run through the airport each year, including military equipment and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made a search for approximately 300 weapons, weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their source materials, from online shopping, passenger aircraft and air freight at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It must be checked for checked baggage and postal items.
In the future, ports will have a big benefit when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs assesses whether additional weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg hopes to think.
School in Kirkkonummi
The Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also attends training with Heila at the police and experts of the Finnish Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Finnish Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides which odors Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are six drug dogs from Finnish Customs, as well as cash and drug dogs Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog at the airport include a whirlwind and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at home in Suntio, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila can be reached at home, Suntio laughs.
Discreet orders go to Heila from a lump sum.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the microphone cover of the camera for a quick dog, but Heila returns the protective cover that looks like a soft toy right away from the "disconnect" command.
Tough competition from working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, in which the training is assessed as sufficient for demanding work tasks.
Heila can be seen in work at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers can’t come and pet the dog on top of the work vest,” says Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is about 60000-70000 euros per year for Customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they will retire to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work parts only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a fierce competition at Customs as the owner of working dogs.
Approximately 20-30 of Customs’ employees applied for Heila as the owner.
Onni hit Suntio, who has not had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and supervision tasks at Customs.
Mini-state got its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
In the country, less than one million residents of Fiji’s Olympic gold in rugby are valued so high that the government has designated the 22nd of August as a national holiday.
According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company, the Fijian government confirmed this after the championship was decided.
The day off is held the day after the team returns home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fiji Rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected for the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, I heard them encourage,” said Maikele Seru to Guardian, editor of Fiji Times.
Drama in Rio - The Finnish Buyer Swirled After Wild Performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilograms after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a raiser.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one has been able to say why.
Tokola received 175 kilograms of push in Rio and 145 kilograms in the event.
His combined result was 320 kg.
Tokola tried to get his push at the latest 175 kilograms, as well as each other.
At the third company, the weights rose accompanied by a wild roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires an attacker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, who plays in the men’s football league, has signed a season-end official striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player for our team with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
With more than ten player-agents, we went through plenty of 50 players from all over the world.
Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, started to stand out from the crowd.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinn, where she scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi residents meet the master of Finland SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Voluptuous Modern Family star shrugs again: teenage star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become familiar with the modern family comedy series as Alex Dunphyna, returns to show off her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don’t leave much to imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the legs of the actress, but also the back.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing its style and behavior considerably bolder.
The star has posed in their social media images in very little clothing and took numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several photos of herself celebrating.
If the image does not appear, you can view it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter has a "typical Hollywood makeover" running from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and has grown in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention Hollywood gets, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actress has been indignant with some of her long-term fans with her image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years, when the downhill is already about hard, says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some female fans, on the other hand, are defending the actor and urging not to care about criticism.
You look great!
Exactly the same thing that others say.
You are inspired by many women, glowing a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the northern lights: In the autumn, it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start their northern lights travel already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations for northern lights tourism in Japan are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a good demand for winter northern lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and continues well into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the sight twice as fairy-tale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, for example.
According to a study conducted by researchers at Aalto University and the University of Turku and the University of Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sights from Finland, and this northern lights has huge potential according to Lind.
In Finland, overnight stays by Japanese tourists have increased significantly more than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed more than twice as much in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest as a target group for tourism in Finland, as they used more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain settles for rugby silver with Fid's master class leading to gold
The UK’s impressive progression in the rugby tournament collapsed to the last challenge that Fidzi presented at the final of the Thursday night, when the team experienced a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji held a masterclass in handling, dismantling, dodging, support game, running lines, and sheer strength when winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The defeat was accompanied by a moderate consolation for the silver medal - the third of the British day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby start-up tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 win of the semi-final played earlier the same day from South Africa could bother them in the final.
But, despite this, Fidi would have won a team of 15 people in top condition in this respect.
The UK may be - but probably not - comforted by the fact that at least one British has a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon.
The UK trip has been quite a bit.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This spanking hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started excellently rejecting the tackling of Great Britain for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they had run towards the moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the goal area in a corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai’s second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and the UK had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tack stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was only a slowdown for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal in the right corner, and the UK was 17-0 at a loss.
Nakarawa scored again for a new start, and the clock still had more than a minute left...first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou rushed through the loose tackling of Great Britain and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the goal kick, the situation was 29-0 when the break took place.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that’s how it really is.
The UK made a stop at the moment to make changes that blocked the Fid dam for four minutes, which compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored the Fid's impressive feeding game.
Dan Norton scored the UK when he scored a touchdown at the left corner and narrowed the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags, and danced in stands.
It was difficult not to admire Fidi’s joyful approach.
Mata Viliame with his last-minute paint was icing on Fid's cake, which did not need icing.
The whistle was whistled, the Fijians hugged and the UK fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten at the semi-finals of Japan 20-5, and the UK won in the tight semi-finals of South Africa where both scored one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took the lead in South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with dazzling footwork and scored a goal under the goals pillars in the second half.
A great late tack from Marcus Watson, brother of English 15-aside rugby team Anthony, secured the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach’s battle against cancer boosted Helen Glover and Heather Stanning’s rowing victory
There will be no more bullish gold in these races, and that really means something.
From the first draw to the last, 220 hard-hitting history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
While they rowed together, there were three voices on the boat, and coach Robin Williams’ echo was present all the time as the two raced for their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women’s rivalry - the first women in the British sports history books to achieve such a achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two great athletes attaching a swan on the surface with a gracefulness, not a completely picture of the nature of victory.
Behind each rowing gold is a group of helpful pair of hands that gradually contribute to the things that matter, and no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who did not know, after 30 months of cancer diagnosis, whether he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was a thorn.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed surgery.
If they do not cut, it spreads everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It will slightly change your way of thinking.
Williams received a diagnosis in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start her treatment at the beginning of the 2014 season, causing as little disruption as possible - if that expression can ever be used in such situations.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
So it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thoughts of the couple were Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery regiment of Afghanistan, said: “I’ve been an emotional ruin this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me.”
It just emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin too, we have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t have anything, so he has great thanks, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition for five years.
The couple set a rough rhythm that their rivals didn’t reach.
Even on the last 500 metres when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very caught in an instant.
Helen shouted “stay in the process, stay in the process”.
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start and didn’t try to do anything special at the same time.
We weren’t looking for fireworks today, we just strive for a good rowing and winning the race, and so we did.
The couple waits for a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will take part in the wedding next month when he gets married to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say this would be my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland changes the government of Panama leaks
In October, Iceland will hold an early parliamentary election that will be demanded by protesters enraged by Panama data leaks already in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for demonstrators.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johansson promised to hold a new election in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the nation’s last-year fury will affect the election result in the autumn.
In June, the criticality of the presidential elections was clearly visible, and Gudni Johansson, who was nominated outside politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama to be the founder of Isis
Donald Trump, President of the U.S. Republicans, cancelled his latest speeches.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of terrorist organization Isis and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be involved in the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic Party became enraged at speeches and demanded for forgiveness from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to fall down to command the army, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the Muslim-popular burkin bathing suit on beaches, says, among other things, the British magazine Guardian.
A decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear that greatly express religious links can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove the French national day to the celebrated crowd.
At the end of July, two men connected to the ISIS attacked the Church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - cyanobacteria in Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only cyanobacteria have been observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Office took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public beaches.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the limits laid down in the Decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The water levels of E.coli and entercoccus in Meriniemi beach were ensured on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the limits of the measures.
The cyanobacteria observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unsuitable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into cyanobacterial bloom, creating blue-green algae mass in ferries.
The environmental policy monitors the situation through increased inspections.
If the cyanobacterial sedimentation turns into cyanobacterial bloom, this is also communicated separately on the beach notice board.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK Hakkarainen on forest gift deduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the budget proposal for next year of the Ministry of Finance.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction that would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change in forest premises.
The proposal by the Ministry of Finance has four objectives: to promote the generational changes of forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea that such a tool will be made to promote the generational changes in forest farms is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds something to criticize in the proposal for a tax change.
A forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner’s pure capital income.
It is capital income, from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The proposal by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health starts with the deduction of the purely capital income from forestry, which would result in the loss of the capital income from forestry, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive tax benefit even if no wood was sold.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner cannot perceive it, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, according to him, the model applies only to a small part of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the income value of the forest is EUR 40 000.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, he says that it cuts 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owner base, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the space.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reductions have been taken away for decades in forest policy.
It is based on the aging of the forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.

The car behind had two people, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more detailed information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that was driving above did not hurt.
The accident happened on highway 8 from Himanka towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments even more efficiently.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of the cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to correspond to normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer drug treatments may be improved by focusing not only on cancer cells but also on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
Research results have been published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
The threshing of Muhos family home death continues at the court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another factor
The threshing of the family home of Muhos continues at the court for both of the sentenced.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for family home killing in Muhos.
The second received 8 years of 4 months of, among other things, the kill and aggravated robbery made as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The sentenced person also received a judgment on aggravated risk of traffic safety as a young person and the right to transport the vehicle as a young person.
The judge of the District Court was appealed by the prosecutor, the attorneys-at-law and the man who received the stricter judgment.
The prosecutor demands that a less severe sentenced man be sentenced for a 12 year imprisonment as a young person.
Are at the moment of action in full understanding
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young people killed a man who worked as the supervisor of the Child Welfare Unit of the school home in July last year.
According to the judgment, the 17-year-old was attacked by a director sitting on the sofa in the living room from behind.
The instructor had got out of the grip and led the young man to his room, where one of the young men struck him with a vacuum pipe.
Among other things, the instructor was strangled, beaten and kicked to the head.
According to the state of mind study, both sentenced were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to law, young people had planned to escape from a family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lasting vertebrate in the world, increases only at the age of 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed as an ice shark, says a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, i.e. the sleeve can live up to 400 years old.
The female only increases at the age of 156.
The lifespan of the ice shark is increased by the fact that it only grows in a centenary year.
Only one species of mussels are known to live longer than ice sharks.
Researchers found their age with radiocarbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the researchers were able to assess the age of the sharks.
The oldest age was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need a different world.
Even a third of all tax revenues in the state would not be received if the change that Donald Trump has driven to corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, due to tax reliefs that benefit the richest ones.
Trump described his tax program revolutionary while presenting it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
A really huge amount would not be collected, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after the reduction proposed by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be transferred completely.
Trump blamed the state for too much regulation in the business sector and for driving small businesses to bankruptcy.
The decided environmental standards of the emergency must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector must be lifted.
The health care reform of Barack Obama must be taken for a new treatment.
The administration shall appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "destroying" trade policy is one of the main causes of US problems.
Free trade agreements would be withdrawn.
A 45 per cent penalty tax would be levied on imports from China and a 35 per cent penalty tax would be levied on imports from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanity, not globality, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need another world:
American cars will drive in the streets, American planes connect cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists – including those close to Republicans – see Trump’s program taking the United States into a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton announced his own programme early Friday in Finland.
A wave of energy from the past - People's News
The sea is ruining fatefully, but the actual storm strikes in the middle of Madrid’s street bustle – accounting with the past can begin.
It summarises the essence of Pedro Almodóvar’s novelty story.
Almodovar’s previous guidance The Travel Lovers (2013) was a little funny and russia-side satirical comedy, the precursor of the Skin in which I live (2011) the career of a Spanish winger.
Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere between the two works.
It is a serene love, relationship and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is seen as a long back.
Life seems to be on its model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a backdrop and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before the birth of his daughter, from the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta’s Adraina Ugarte, who plays as a young teacher, will appear in the second female main part of the series Sew-on (2013-2014).
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a cleavage, but I myself would say that quite cunningly and literally with a single swipe.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance from Julieta to such a distinctive bursting sensation.
It is an equally well-proclaimed, understated, place with good music and a rather sad film with elements of elegance as it is.
Instead, the typical visual saturation of the Spanish instructor is retained and so that it starts to slowly intimidate more as a pure form than as a functional dramatic effect.
People in the film are tested by diseases, deaths or just sudden losses, but the surface remains as Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name person, the outfit changes from scene to scene, and the same applies to spectacular ears.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the tunings of the respective scene, is not improved in particular.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript on the basis of three short stories by the award-winning Canadian Alice Munro in Nobel.
Novellit is published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly equitable literary filming.
There would have been a lot of material for even more dramatic drama, so much big things - especially the grubbing guilt - the thematics of the film are discussed.
Directed and screenplay by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
Government tries election gigs - People's News
No new cuts will be made, quirky ministers, so that the Finns Party would not collapse completely.
However, surgeries decided on in the spring will be carried out in a lot of stores.
There will be no new surgeries.
The already decided savings of four billion are sufficient.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) say.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM’s performance, because the decisions on social security cuts were already made in the spring frame.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training surgeries continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why do ministers emphasize so drastically that no new cuts are made on top of them?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not gallups.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal election result, which takes the different directions of the government parties, will ruin the atmosphere of the government for a long time.
The Gallups report, however, that the government party to the Finns Party expects a brawling loss, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new delegates, most of which next spring will see a realisation of the price of influencing the right-wing government.
The life thread of the government of about three equal parties is dependent on the resistance of the Finns Party to endure.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters received enough government policy already during the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s fermentation have also come to the surface.
First of all, new cuts will be blurred by the fact that next year they will be carried out drastically and secondly, trying to soften the attack that awaits the Finns Party.
Large surgeries in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set the target of indebtedness during this election period, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take a debt of EUR 5.9 billion next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the Board of Directors has two options.
The first is to raise your hands early in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: indebtedness is not likely or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
It means even harder new cuts on top of the former in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be ruined at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring, what will happen will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
Indebtedness by these measures is not likely to occur
It is completely clear that the current measures do not bend the debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to instill a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the press conference on the budget prove it unrecognised:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, which means that there will be no appeal to the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008 except during the recovery policy that was carried out temporarily in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this decade and prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros per year more than in 2008.
In the curves presented by Hetemäki, public debt exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about six billion euros, which is practically covered by taking a whole new debt.
This is the view of the city centre, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Survey: Municipalities want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four thinks that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity for children is the responsibility of the municipality.
A clear majority of the population also rolls the responsibility for libraries, culture, adult education centres, construction supervision, general upper secondary education and waste management to an individual municipality.
Regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education and training, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities are the most clearly wanted to be responsible for the region.
None of the tasks under municipal responsibility are to be transferred to the state.
A underage drunkard ran after the chase police run away
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsitie on Friday night at half a time.
The police patrol tried to stop without a motorbike driven by lights, but the young man started driving the police away at a fair speed.
The pursuit continued to Sonkajanrantantie, from where it continued to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the quicker cop ran away.
The blowing test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver’s license that would have justified driving a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, among other things, as aggravated endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch
A truck in Kivilasti fell into a trench on Kaavintie at 21.15.
The truck had drifted out of the road in the bend to the left and fell on its side into the trench.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver away from the crashed truck through the leftover door together with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the owner of the car.
A fallen truck spilled on the road hydraulic oil, which the rescue department absorbed into the peat.
The police investigate the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon on the Ilmajoki River
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki, Lahtinkylä, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for about 165 centimetres long, slender and well-groomed women with white hair under the chin.
Observations and tips on the movements of a lost person are requested to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre’s tip number 029544053.
The material of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery about the destruction of Parafesti
The flooding of the tents of the Parafestival caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chair of the Parafesto Association of Joensuu, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performance of Parafesti, Kalle Salonen, was performed at the end of Friday evening on the market stage.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances held at the City Theatre from 13 a.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized as planned.
The flow rate is created in the lightning cloud when rainwater and its weight start the falling air flow.
The changes in the state of thunder cloud water bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
It is reported from the Finnish Meteorological Institute that several surge currents occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of downstreams is difficult to predict.
The rush flow hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum in Parafesti on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents crashed, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the event of an accident, four persons were slightly injured.
There was one child in the group who was transported slightly injured to further care.
Air pollution aging Londoners
According to a study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British survey shows the Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analyzes the most toxic fine particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retirees in London is two and a half years older than, for example, an adult living in rural areas.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, suffer from nearly 9 500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk especially for those Londoners who go on a business trip walking around crowded streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution with various masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes cheated - poking the man standing in front
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the brakes of the tractor betrayed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man didn’t stay under it, but the tractor was able to push the man so much that he was transported to the central hospital with serious injury to further examinations.
The tractor didn’t flow further, as it collided with the stones in front.
Fun with new strength for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, starts with a series starting in October from a better starting point than a man’s memory.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common tune can be found more confidently than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been gloomy for Riennon.
Jani Säisä, who continues as the head coach of Riento, praises the new team as an entrepreneur and cohesive.
Fred Musoni starts his second season in Rienno.
The new face is Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played in Rwanda’s national team, is a 205-centimetre chipper.
Garchet is similarly a passer, the Brazilian measures 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and Jokipojat to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing almost all floorball World Championships since 2003.
Now in Tampere there are already the sixth races, only 2013 was missed after Canada had been better in North American qualifying.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed a report.
The USA was in the process of establishing a floorball team.
I became interested and now we are here, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967, near New York, in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen studied data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at the Finnish Championship level as floorball.
The floorball was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipojat hockey in the Finnish Championships, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship in 1991-92, followed by three in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club for the A-girls championship.
Women’s Finnish Championship career culminated in silver 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played through the women’s Finnish Championships 10, the balance in 169 games was 51+34=85.
The latest Finnish Championship season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
The Joensuu-based floorball club, Josban, was brought up by Perttu Puska and the Eno-based Tatu Väänänen, was chosen to join the Finnish national team who played in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on November 6-8.
Perttu Puska, 25-year-old in the Helsinki-based wilderness, has played this before six men’s international matches, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen from Wiler-Ersigen from Switzerland has recovered from the thigh pain and is part of the team’s standard fleet with 117 ground matches.
The national team was also named Mika Kohonen, a veteran player of the Seinäjoki Game Brothers, who was last seen on the Finland shirt in the last December World Cup.
The main coach of the Floorball team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley expert Essi Hasu’s circle closes in Kouvola - SM-kulta is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is ending as a beach volley player at least after a temporary season.
The Finnish Championships in Beach volley will be held in Kouvola Sports Park during the weekend.
In three days, the medals are played in both adult and youth leagues.
In cooperation with the Finnish Volleyball Association and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best pairs in each league will be eligible for the final tournament.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will get to the auditorium during the weekend.
There will surely be a great arena for the peis stadium.
I haven’t played very often in the adult leagues in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu feels.
The Kouvola region lit up Hasu’s spark for sports and gave good food for a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in Elimäen NMKY’s E-girls.
The top is a shirt too big in mind, knee pads on the ankles, as well as awe-inspiring cries and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone’s families were strongly involved in the activities - the teammate’s father coached us and our mother was the club chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was a natural choice for the balance of indoor volleyball already during the junior season.
The beach at the Käyrälampi lake has been playing beach since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active at the bus stop.
I also went to follow the Finnish Junior Championships myself, thinking that some day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki in the SM-finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the second-ranked duo’s goal is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We are still missing Finnish Championship gold in the prize cabinet, Hasu throws in a mysterious way.
The performance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last in front of a familiar audience for Hasu.
New challenges await in civilian work at the beginning of September.
International career is over after the tournament at Kisakallio.
Otherwise, flip-flops are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Overflow fell tents at an event for the disabled in Joensuu, a major accident was close

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweating and vigor.
The young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he also believes in a positive future in the countryside.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his little brother Valtteri Koli started their operations as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
As a rural entrepreneur, it was important to start taking debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come into the hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since the little boy.
I’m always happy to be on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything in the game.
If something starts, then I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a barn, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I was very brave enough to join the project and I have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything is still good.
The aim of Salomon Koli, which grows meat trucks, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the young food producer competition of the magazine Rural Future.
He is currently competing for a potential win.
You can vote on the magazine’s website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure for years (after June 2012) and the first figure above zero after last October, when positive 0.2% was announced.
The annual average inflation measured by the cost of living index was -0.8% over the past 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the cost of living index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 to December 2015) inflation was -0.2% and annual inflation was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumer goods saw an increase: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
The prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat’s “anime” effect is rated as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but according to some observers it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with their identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, dog or character that would suit Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Lenses are simple, face twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been judged with accusations that the app advertises a blackface mask or prefers bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised to some users this week a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth, and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - a “yellow face”.
And they wondered if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company’s bigger problem regarding diversity.
News and resentment spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, day later Snapchat said it had abolished the feature.
The company provided an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But for racism experienced observers, the lens was a reminder of infringing stereotypes in action.
Others forbade the anime comparison fiercely.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student with a tweet widely shared from the photos, said in his email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that ‘it’s hard to argue against a comparison with a side-by-side aggravated Asian caricature and filter effects’.
It shows that the filter is not only a yellowface, but a yellowface taken to extreme degradation.
Snapchat is not the only company that surpasses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be tied to the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporation meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially more diverse audiences can mean that even more likely they are looking for an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an offensive image for the user, “it’s much harder for these types to be discreet.”
On Thursday Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company mainly for white male leadership and finished his writing with #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
Either they do not have diverse representation of different skin colours in their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions,” said Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have representatives of different skin colours at work, but they are not in a position where they would feel safe or could speak directly.”
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to respond to.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its staff, but according to the representative, the company recently hired the recruiter to focus on under-represented populations and advance internal inclusion efforts.
For their part, Zhu said that keeping their Snapchat accounts closed, adding: “Is it actually that they need more users like us to say that this is not ok.”
Congress panel reports that military officials distorted Isis intelligence
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress panel said that the intelligence reports from the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces had been modified to provide a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against Isis than the events on site justified.
In the interim report of the Working Group set up by the Republican Chair, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Monetary Subcommittee of the House of Representatives, a ‘wide-spread dissatisfaction’ was observed among intelligence analysts at the headquarters, who said that the managers tampered with their assessment of American efforts to win Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The intelligence outputs accepted by the higher Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the anti-terrorism efforts in the United States than justified by the on-site facts, which were regularly more positive than the analyses produced by other intelligence community authors,” the report stated.
Centcom’s events are impossible to accept – our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers,” said Representative Ken Calvert, California’s Republican.
The failures of Centcom’s management reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the persistent problems in the headquarters descriptions and analyses of US efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-ranking government authorities in Obama’s administration have ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts as if Centcom’s leaders put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic state, ISIS, in a more positive light.
During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and certificates from the headquarters were much more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
For example, Centcom’s authority publicly stated that a major attack to reclaim Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still owned by Isis.
After months of research, this is very clear,” said Mike Pompeo, the Kansas Republican.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces military headquarters manipulated the outputs of the headquarters intelligence to undermine the threat of Isis in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic state was manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will monitor the larger results while the investigation is underway.
The Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has started an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom’s inquiry.
On Thursday, the Democratic Members of the House of Representatives published their own findings, which were consistent with the conclusions of some of the Republican working groups.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessary isolated process for the intelligence assessment of the ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the leader of the committee, in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process “abandoned the release of intelligence outputs”, deteriorated the mood among analysts, and “did not give enough space for different perspectives”.
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom’s analysts to adapt their conclusions to “pre-set or political narrative”.
The Daily Beast will report the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that Pentagon’s senior inspector has started an investigation after the complaints of Centcom’s analysts.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, a representative of Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the report of the Congress as long as the investigation of the Supreme Inspector is ongoing.
But he said that ‘the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of relevant information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security topics’.
The study has other post-sanctions than the question of whether U.S. bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can trust the headquarters to deliver honest assessments of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
An Islamic state intelligence review reflects a dispute more than a decade ago when Centcom Intelligence Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite the protests of several analysts, President George W. Bush's government supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about what consequences the 2003 attack would have.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding Islamic state intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that despite the counter-public statements, the expressions against the Islamic government-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group’s economy, as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black exchange.
The Times reports in September that this find was not reported outside the headquarters.
Centcom's commander at the time, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many of the legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive estimate of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins for the fourth consecutive time in a women's field hockey event, arranging a showdown with the UK
A day after three goals were scored when the team defeated Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's field hockey team when the Americans defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games sound like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn’t sure if he had done the same before.
I have no idea," he said.
I’m not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals.”
But he knows this: in the 4-0 event, the Americans are in the Olympic tournament and they share their group first place with the UK, who was still unbeatable after winning on Thursday 2-0 in Japan.
The UK and the United States will face the first round in the final game on Saturday.
Both teams have survived the quarter-finals, and this game determines who will be the first and who will be the second in their group of six.
First placed to avoid a strong Dutch, second group leader, a bit longer at the start of quarter finals.
However the Saturday game ends, the Americans have stirred up with their surprising success here, four years after they left the last 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up a hockey stick for the first time at the age of 3 (his older double sisters played the sport at Drexel) in relation to the national team at the age of 16, when he became its youngest player ever.
He was not included in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to participate in the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went for him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed as a coach, and things began to change.
Change in culture, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the same pace of work as we have now in London.
We have completed a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half of the finish with a knuckle stroke near the finish line.
India had landed any victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation at 1-0 until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then circled in the middle and pulled the ball to the goal, taking the American 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth round in the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper for Jackie Briggs to make one goal for each of the first three wins.
He is in a good tone.
So is Bam.
We now have a good situation,” Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Trampoline peace in the middle of the Olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are running.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, furious message of competition and effort.
As if the Olympic torch itself was a flaming signal stick passed from an archer to a swimmer and from an gymnast to a triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on a TV, read a newspaper or listen to a neighbor’s conversation in the café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympic and future cardiac crusher with a smile, could well be one of the names known to everyone, presented at the best viewing time, supported by sponsorship deals and TV ads of the good mind - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all the species as much.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breast swim, long live it.
But if I get to make a decent number of my special favorites, I would like to pay attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance in the Sydney Games, there were so few observations in the past 16 years that many I interviewed did not realize it was a Olympic sport at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance until the finals in 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men’s, Chinese and Canadian women’s medals.
This year, China’s Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan defend their London gold medals.
However, trampoline is associated with a certain type of underdog charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I have to confess that I am not an expert, I am just a flightless fan.
The sport has possibilities for amusing things, as it is noticed by the vibrations of the endless bounces of the drawing films, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jumping, two species that it combines in principle.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a pop-up board.
The champions of the championship jump on a giant trampoline up to almost 30 feet high and must perform swirling motion sequences (translations, folds and flips) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic Games program, they are evaluated on the basis of implementation, difficulty and “flight time”.
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women competing in Rio.
The most common direction of the Olympics is directly ahead.
Those wishing to win the medal need to go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
Not only do they hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in television news, another tawny line: the world or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and it can even get the viewer to tears.
But it’s also the reason why watching a race can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline offers a moment of rest here.
The tramway direction is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new height, appearing weightless as an astronaut, then goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is neither competition nor difficulty in this, but during the program there is no raging rush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, only a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It’s as close to the zen space as the Olympics can get.
Women’s qualification competitions and then the finals will be held on the afternoon at 13 (ET), men’s competitions will also be held on Saturday at 13 (EET).
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon program from 14 a.m. on both days.
In the middle of an Olympic drug, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is probably not noticeable in general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering male athletes to stare at and objectify (as the U.S. male gymnasts some time ago suggested according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley just waits for his sighing new fan base.
Generation shows his mind” in Ethiopia, a long-term ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators seeking political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition by the government.
The eyewitnesses say that dozens of demonstrators have been shot to death in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable states in Africa, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as they spread to more and more areas.
Alone last week, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a profound political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s reply was ruthless.
The eyewitnesses said that the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
The widened videos recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how security authorities beat young people with sticks while being forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations Directorate-General for Human Rights now calls for thorough research.
It was always difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager for the International Crisis Group at the Horn of Africa.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country gets so much western help.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely, and the capital city of Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The city streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly talked about government oppression, the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But this can be changing.
If you suppress people and they don’t have alternatives other than to show their minds, this will happen,” said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth shows his mind.
One generation shows his mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover all aspects of the throttling of the power of the coalition that governs land use.
After the much-criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last opposition, and now it holds all the seats of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea increase, and the battle along this narrow and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less defeated over the past few years, can try to exploit and rearm.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of swelling under the surface, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only over the past few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through the network proxy servers hiding the location.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, Ethiopia’s two largest ethnic groups, Oromo and Amharic, will get along better with each other.
Oromo and Amharic are not natural allies.
For a very long time, Amharas, who mainly come from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business, taking advantage of Oromas, many of which are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella,” said Mulatu Gemechu, Oromo Director.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amharic and Oromo people think Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people, covering about six per cent of the population and managing the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
There is no basic instinct like that in modern administration,” said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles’ boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services managed by tigres do not trust him.
Many people are afraid that this can lead to increased shedding of blood.
For the last time, Ethiopia was under such a turmoil in 2005, when thousands of protests, according to analysts, appeared to have been looted by the government first and then robbed them.
In the effect followed, many protesters died, albeit less than in the last few months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly, this has not stopped the intrinsic contempt of the Ethiopian government.
And now it begins to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked companies owned by Tigres, and anti-tigre anger becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say demonstrations put the United States and other western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for airplane flights to the neighbouring country of Somalia, although some time ago it said that it had closed this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their already unstable region to collapse.
”This,” Abdi said, “is real balancing.”
Donald Trump explains Obama-founded-ISIS-as "larcasm"
Donald J. Trump attempted to suppress his latest campaign against the controversy on Friday, claiming that he was not serious when this week, he numerous times instigated that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the presidential candidate of Republicans to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a turbulent period, in a difficult position where they need to explain the remarks that he may not mean.
Following the suggestion made at the Wednesday night campaign meeting, Trump claimed the same more and more eagerly in the Thursday interviews, where he insisted that he really intended to say that President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, Trump said that he was just sarcastic in the early Friday morning Twitter post.
The publication was a full translation from the day before when Trump said in several interviews that he was really serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump to make his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took him to his hearing ears.
The latest review storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the middle of economic sentiment research results.
Trump and Clinton fought for the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
Fleeing back to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he kept speech boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm defense.
Late in July, when he met a broad review apparently suggesting that Russians should hack Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remarks by saying “I guess I’m sarcastic.”
The approach allows Trump to go to the political boundaries and then come back if necessary.
I think it’s a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans, he looks at how they work and then ‘clarifies’ in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, Communications Specialist who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think she is cunning about her statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of mitigating his speeches for the general public, Trump has been even more stunned in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
The new, Friday-released NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey showed that Trump is dragging Clinton far in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump generally tries to avoid apologizes for provocative matters, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humour.
As he faces an ever closer review of the presidential campaign in the last few months, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies to an uncomfortable position where they have to publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former Mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, put a lot of effort in defending the candidate in CNN’s interview on Thursday.
I believe there are real, political comments in his words,” Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump’s argument that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that he called amateur, absolutely wrong, and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued to attack the news media on Twitter, which grind his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked “bad, pathetic” TV experts trying to find out about him saying “They won’t succeed!”
Some democrats mocked Trump’s excuse as a new evidence that he was an inappropriate president.
The previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg where there was no wireless network but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake shaped soaps.
It was the most recent loss of locality in a middle-class renovated city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I can’t believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is today a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, it is also reinventing.
The revitalized Verb opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile from the original location last November.
The new Verb has wifi and can be paid by credit card, but some staff are still the same and there is the same unspoiled atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of an old café who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches, and the coverings include e.g. capers and browned onions.
The bowls have brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old loyal customers.
Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers as well,” he said.
One last Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was a client like this.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he walked to the cafe.
He says that when Verb closed, he gave up coffee drinking for a while.
I understood that I enjoyed Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although on that day he ordered instead of his usual iced coffee a mixed chai drink, one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
Every day more than seven, regularly than a clock, I went in and they were preparing my spicy bagelian butter,” he said.
Photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes due to variation, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn’t bear a grudge to the soap shop who took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered Verb a special soap which would be used as an ingredient in the coffee shop’s cold-extracted coffee.
”I think we can still grab an offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to put it up soon to something to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café expands to the next building.
For many customers, it is enough for them to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a loyal customer and said it was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like coming home while walking in and ordering coffee.
I had longed to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: the paralyzing food of the lay season
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to have lunch in his office.
As a delicacy, President Roosevelt liked refined Fifth Avenue dishes, such as goose liver paste, and Maryland’s marsh turtle soup.
That day his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and for dessert plum pudding.
It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in Lower East Side apartment block through food in her book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the great depression of the 1930s.
By showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist at the Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unspoiled lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been in operation since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a portion with turkey, potato purée and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered a meat tender, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the eating of the lay season.
The crumbs were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was peanut crust, liver crust, bean crust.
They were made from a fabrication material and some cheap ingredient that was used to continue the actual fabrication material.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Coe grinned.
It certainly felt lead-heavy on the stomach,” he said.
In years before the depression at American tables, especially in the countryside, there was like eating-as-a-lot-like-ears-tack.
The women's groups made food for male farm workers, and the fresh pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to the hungry during the First World War, and the A Square Meal chronicled the ways in which the nation survived that it was no longer a country of abundance.
At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans,” Coe said explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes such as macerators and boxes became the main dishes, and the box was a “great way to use food scraps”, mentioned Ziegelma, as the chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the heart of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special compositions were experimented with calorie levels and nutrient content, more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While doing research also for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era dish in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
It wasn’t a popular addition to the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said, “It was unreal.”
Peanut butter is in no way suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, Director of the Federal National Agency in 1923-1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budgeters” and respond to the challenge of converting chunks like pureed spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are the stories of government reactions to hungry citizens, as President Herbert Hooverin allows me to eat cake attitude.
At the same time as he publicly praised the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he ate like a sophisticated millionaire who had become.
He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce,” said Coe.
He ate a tuxedo in the almost gilt dining room.
He was awesome outside of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As described in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that “not only offered Washington's most gloomy, but also the worst-prepared food.”
Many of the continual eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Ziegelman, and how science applies to cooking.
The couple said that while writing a book, they gained a better understanding of how to eat Ziegelman’s mother’s food, for example, how she could not throw food away.
He really was afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, “He even got people sick.”
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
It’s called plum foam,” Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a name.
There was no whipped cream in the dessert, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everybody sank their spoons unwillingly into a sticky, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe sanzed once and again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he said to his wife: “Slightly chopped walnuts could help”.
Gilead is compensated for attorney-at-law costs in the Hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
The U.S. Engagement Judge has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc. be entitled to receive the costs of attorneys in a dispute against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc concerning hepatitis C patient.
In June, Gilead was released for a fee of $200 million after breaking two Merck patents related to Gilead’s successful drugs Sovald and Harvo, following the discovery by an American judge of Merck’s abuses involving false oaths and other unethical practices.
In the judgment of Thursday, Beth Labson Freeman, the U.S. civil court judge, said that Gilead was entitled to be released from the compensations incurred by it in the event of an action against it.
Merck tries to catch Gilead, who dominates the market in a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can clearly cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other to justice for the ownership of the sophosbuvir-based laboratory work in Gilead.
U.S.-backed troops say they've completely taken control of Isis's Manbij
U.S.-backed troops have taken full control of the Turkish border city of northern Manbij since the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, the group representative said on Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2000 civilian hostages, which the fighters considered prisoners, from the Allies of Sharfan Darwin SDF, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
The city is now entirely under our control, but we’ve started exploring it,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 to pay 34.2 percent federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return, which showed that the income of the Democratic President and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mainly Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book on the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's Vice President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, published a 10-year tax return.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the benchmark for economic transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, Campaign Assistant at Clinton.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
According to custom, the U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, although the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the Tax Board’s audit as the reason for the refusal to publish tax returns.
Your turn,” Ian Sams, Clinton’s campaign assistant, said on Twitter when publishing a link to the tax returns of the Democratic Candidate.
On Thursday, Trump’s Special Adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are ready.
Trump’s critics, including presidential candidate for the 2012 Republicans, Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem by publishing an online video on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans who urge Trump to release their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his financial speech in Michigan.
He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done in recent decades: to publish his tax return,” he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in two 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist borrowed on Friday numerous tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett to ensure that more than $1 million per year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
In Clinton's meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he is also undergoing an audit by the tax administration, and that Trump is not “afraid” of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, Clintons in Chappaqua, New York, had a real federal tax rate of around 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate of around 40.5%.
Clinton’s tax return for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was an affordable investment fund tied to the index, and Clinton reported $109,000 dividend and interest income.

Nature preservers in Tanzania use an unusual means to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - they throw animals in condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proved to be effective, and the idea was invented several years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the US Nature Conservancy, to enhance its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of Northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step approach to protecting homes and hundreds of animals without hurting them.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the elephant day of the world dedicated to the protection of these animals.
Since we developed...tools, we have seen a change in attitudes in these communities, and now we are much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, Executive Director at Honeyguide.
The first two steps include showing the intrusive elephant with a flashlight and playing the horn.
If it does not prevent the animal, the so-called “chili cloud” is thrown.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chilli powder and earth, and then the condom is twisted so that only the ignition wire remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts out and bursts chilli powder dust into the air.
One scent is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The last method is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air.The fireworks produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes a Berlin hotel that removed the Israeli area code at Arab request
The French, Jewish-backed filmmaker unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list the Israeli area code, according to the employee, due to the “requests” of Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, a documentary film about the Holocaust, broke his frustration with the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol hotel, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the country’s list of directions offered by the hotel in Israel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and wiped?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the option to call Israel via its own call center.
When searching for an explanation, the filmmaker spoke at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he had received was “stilling him.”
The hotel’s recipeist said it was a “thought-out decision by the management of Kempinski hotels”.
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock in the filmmaker.
Most of our guests are Arabs, and they require the removal of the Israeli area code,” says Lanzmann.
The German ambassador of Israel Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case a "great wrong", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were terrified and shocked because of the case.
It is a great wrong in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This does not need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel simply ‘supplied’ to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
Disgrace,” was said in another publication that pointed out that the hotel on the stunning Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called the incident “inattention” and “apologized” to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
A clear command not to include Israel in the quick selection list was never made,” says Suddeutche Zeitung, a representative of Kempinski.
It adds that the area code is now added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to show their mind against Brazilian students
On Thursday, the students teamed up with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when the students gathered to show their minds against the reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement attempted to break down the student population, leading to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in a demonstration to express their horror of plans.
According to the proposals of Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools would be closed, and 300 000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against temporary President Michel Temer on the walls.
This last demonstration took place only days after the protesters set out as a group to support the arrested President Dilma Rousseff, as the Senate of the country votes for him.
RT Business: Russian-Iranian trade is suddenly growing by 71%
Following the abolition of sanctions, net sales from trade between Moscow and Tehran have increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
After the international sanctions against Iran left, Russian companies have shown great interest in doing business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Naturally, one of Iran’s two-way cooperation goals is to expand the trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that in the first five months of 2016, the net sales of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 to a total of $856 million.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran rose by 91.5 per cent to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
The growth in trade was achieved through the delivery of machines, vehicles and weapons,” the Ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representatives in Iran issued approximately 35 000 visas to Iran’s citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries that visited the most tourists in Russia for the first time.
It’s safe to say that last year’s record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, quite few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
Scots Callum Skinner plunged into the finish line as the British grabs bike gold
Scotland’s Callum Skinner was honoured at the men’s team print at Rio’s cycling stadium last night when the UK team’s trio defended their championship in London from 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow played a role as an anchor in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy rehabilitated, the legend was proud of the young man, who was the winner of the finish line from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth in six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after setting modestly sixth at the March World Circuit Championships in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London races was the replacement of special sender Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
The end of Hoy also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man whose British coaches were holding on to the potential in Scots, which has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the title with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner made the Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel of gold.
Hindes was close behind him after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team into the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the deformation, and it included driving Hindes in a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep up with the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and caught the attention of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they stepped on the podium.
23-year-old Glasgow-based Skinner said, “Comparation is flattering.”
I'm just here to do my best and gain fame.
We made an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was absolutely amazing.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed the track after a bad start.
He later drew back his comment, and the British rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with the superior win.
Hindes said, “I felt like I had been in London with so many UK flags on the pedestal.”
As a team, we found the connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten bike sports in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are waiting for five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on the condition shown by the kennel, it is not at all impossible to imagine him playing Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic gold in one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that apparently on a sacred day in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - the total number of medals would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoylla.
Kenny competes in the next sprint that starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I just enjoy this one now.
The team competition is always the best.
It will be won together with friends.
Winning alone is honestly lonely.”
Hindes said: “If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the value of the knight.”
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in time in a four-person, four-kilometer team chase.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London 2012, the world record is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, on the second day of the race, when Wiggins is sure to be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time periods when the officials invited him to length measurement.
In the corresponding women’s competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald progressed in record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The UK team has learned to trust that its great track cycling team takes over the middle of the Olympics and reaches a whole host of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been undermined before the Rio races.
The background has been drama, the least of which have not been the difference between the technical director, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexism and temptation charges, as well as the end of a competitive career of majors such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first night races at the cycling stadium, however, it seems that the UK’s legendary reputation now reaches its peak at the perfect moment could once again be true.
Portland’s smelter future questionable due to electricity contract cut-off
Portland’s Victoria’s aluminum smelter, as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs, is uncertain when the electricity distribution company reveals that one of the factory’s owners is about to end the distribution agreement, so it is expected to be a cut in all distribution agreements.
The measure follows the decision made earlier this year by the Government of Victoria that the support required for the operation of the factory will not be continued.
The allowance for a period of 20 years will end in November.
Up to 2000 jobs can be at risk at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Up to 2000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect can be possible, as the smelter uses about 10% of all Victoria’s electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter, which led to the closure of Anglesea's power plant last year.
The smelter in Alcoan Portland loses money and is under a threat of closure.
The operation is now following several years of speculation on the future of the factory, which started as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the cost of the factory’s production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects the three other owners to end their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
AGL is waiting for the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the smelter-free physical power needs will continue,” he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called ‘protection agreements’, which had to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
For this reason, AGL expects the contracts to generate profit for the financial year 2017,” the electricity company said.
At the moment, the strong outlook for the futures markets in electricity prices will be limited to all possible earnings effects for AGL from the financial year 2018.
AGL said it has already “expected” the value of contracts in its bookkeeping by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements “do not affect Alcoa ... the ability to maintain smelter in operation or secure smelter-free electricity supply”.
The American company said that it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the contract.
The analysts have been wary of both Portland, Victoria, and also because of the potential closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, as the economic situation in the industry is poor.
Earlier in the week, AGL’s Executive Director Stephen Mikkelsen said to analysts that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both factories exit the market, it is a significant reduction in the demand for the [electricity] market.
As an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing for us,” he said.
Kendall, not just the reality TV star of the Kardashians, is on the deck of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of Vogue's desired September issue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and model at Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on Thursday with her Instagram account.
Watching this cover in a room full of dear people made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a unique (or maybe just like the Kardashians?), a scripted reality video in which the entire Clan of Kardashian-Jenner (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and accompanied by everyone’s favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of his sister, but ended with a classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
It’s a clichéd plot of almost every children’s television series “birthday” (Seacrest says the words “you probably didn’t think we’d forget you” with the credibility of the morning-drawn bunny), but Kris had to make her somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we are sure to enter the new Kardashian era with the September Vogue seat.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have made the Vogue cover first (he shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is in a class of its own.
Vogue's September issue is the most sold edition of the whole year.
Its thickness is more similar to the coffee record than the fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion, it declined that from last year’s 832-page opus 615 was ad content).
For the past two years, photos of the magazine have leaked before the official announcement are expected to be revealed.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has indeed had more “celebs that act as models” than “models that are celebrities”.
Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on deck in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honorary seat.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as his generation’s “success model”, hit the first category, he is in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or today’s young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are well-founded talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
With the release of Lemonade, the cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years in her career.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with the success of Jenner.
With his reality TV history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria’s Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the buck of the moment".
This feeling resurfaced with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction, rotation is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He is a model for Marc Jacobs.
She sells you Estee Lauder's foundation.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications behind the paywall.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she took to the LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he is a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn away 160 000 people every year
The most vulnerable of more than 160 000 people are turned away from Community legal centres every year, as the sector prepares for the effects of additional financial cuts on its already-off-border activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like – are already turned away when they are looking for free legal advice and representation.
The legal services already stretched to the extremities of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are scheduled to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, Head of Legal Centres in the Queensland Community, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being translated every year.
Farrell said that if a federal government decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only worsen.
The Queensland Community Legal Centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people every year are turned away from essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippled debts, families in legal separation, unfamiliarly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
The federal government cuts finance by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents are forced to navigate the middle of legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice and the senator of Queensland to George Brands that they would immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government implemented its pledge to raise the funding for legal assistance to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the government of Palaszczuk should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after an employee was allegedly threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged to the court for not doing anything after they were told that the campaign’s North Carolina operations manager threatened with gun employees in February when they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in the state campaign’s former software intern Vincent Bordin’s action in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that “it wouldn’t happen”.
Chief Earl Phillip “came a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pushed the barrel against Vincent’s kneecap,” Bordini said on the cover.
After complaining to a local and regional campaign manager, Bordi heard that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phillip, was said in the action.
”We don’t have to fire weapons to cause damage,” Bordini said in the action.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when telling the public in North Carolina that ‘people of the second addition’ - which is usually understood as owners of weapons and weapons - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose the judges.
Trump’s campaign said that the media has taken his word out of context, and that he is not in favour of violence.
In the challenge of Bordin, compensation is sought from the campaign for careless surveillance and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump’s representative Hope Hicks did not reply to the comment request immediately.
Companies were unable to reach Phillip.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlotte, reports that Phillip has recently left the campaign.
The callback request submitted to Innovative Consulting Services by his consulting company was not answered immediately.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.
The case is with Bordi, Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
The British must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourish to the whole stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was a great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we saw a huge amount of effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the races.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
A total of 10 000 new internships and 40 000 new jobs are created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment is removed around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Games, some come thinking that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the race and that we would be shamed in the face of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heathrow.
Obstacles are always to be crossed, but Heathrow answers every question presented to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The extension is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion pounds of economic growth, as well as leave the heritage of skills and employment around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has completed the £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on budget: from the T5, which has been voted the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement a third runway supported by £16 billion in private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a big success for the UK, and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion is also one of them.
It’s time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trading and create a heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Heathrow Board and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat and mouse play about blocking ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, the ad blocker is “cat and mouse play,” said one of the companies that manufacture such a program.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on their computer pages, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update the program filters to again block ads on social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code is changed around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has rotated a new code.
In the blog post, Adblock’s representative, Ben Williams, wrote that “this kind of battle between an open-source advertising community and its orbiters has been running since the ad blocker was invented”, and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how great the grief of ad blockers has become in the industry.
Around 200 million ad blockers worldwide are reported in last year’s Pagefair and Adobe survey, which is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is behind the ad blockers on the pages used on the computer, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram,” the agent said.
Computer ads still bring enough revenue to make Facebook consider this kind of an investment worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said that it would daily use its “ad preference” tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site’s non-advertising content.
This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem,” the Facebook representative said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman caught under the car on the Swiss highway apparently for suicide
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman was left under several vehicles on the highway in the early hours of Thursday, apparently suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in the Canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman made a “desperating act” and settled in the dark to lie on the road where she was hit by several vehicles,” the policeman of Vaud said in a statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the venue.
Several drivers related to the event have already been examined, but not all have yet been identified, said the police, who appealed to them and to all witnesses of the incident to register.
Criminal investigation has started, which is a logical step in this kind of situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved is prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains to be decided by the prosecutor,” Hofstetter said.
For the past five years, two similar cases suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - where there was a person who walked on the dark highway - it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to meet pedestrians on the highway in the middle of the night, the magazine said.
Last year, the police were released from charges for negligence after he hit and killed a man who lay on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had gone out on the road, the court was told.
The court stated that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, drove in a justified manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “completely unusual and unpredictable,” the judge said.
Anyone who has information about the case on Thursday near Morges must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA’s climate model: Venus had to once live
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely to once be habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus’ past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the atmosphere filled with hot, waterless surfaces and carbon dioxide could sometimes have been earth-like conditions at Venus.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’s slow rotation speed explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have been running slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet was likely to have drier areas than Earth, but once there was enough water and variation to enable life and from the rapid evaporation of water to protection.
The advantage of the early Venus was also the sun 30% fainter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its side of the sun for almost two months at a time,” explained GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface for a large part of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperatures in the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than the current temperatures in the Earth.
The model produced a story from the development stages of Venus, similar to what the planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be inhabited at times, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gases remained - Venus, which we now know.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters publication.
Patrick Roy gives up Avalache's coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the actions of Colorado Avalanche’s coach and vice president of ice hockey issues, saying that there was a reason to influence the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado Vice President/President Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
For the last three years, I have been the vice president and head coach of Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in the statement.
During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how to improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the vice president of ice hockey must be fully in line with the organization’s view.
They must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Patrick told me today about his decision,” Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization, and we hope happiness for him in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the League in his first season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the victory of the central division, but Minnesota knocked down Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not finished in the last two years.
Avalanche’s games for the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost to the five points Wild, losing the wild card slot of the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame's goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The labour struggles of oil workers in the North Sea are postponed as all sides of the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations," the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been arranged randomly on the North Sea drilling rigs led by Royal Dutch Shell.
The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT federations can confirm that we have agreed to re-launch the process aimed at resolving the current dispute,” the joint opinion read.
During the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings from early next week so that we can take a fresh view of the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they claim to be the first in more than 25 years, was an objection to possible, up to 30% pay cuts.
This year, Wood Group cut the fees of North Sea contractors by about 9% due to the negative market pressure.
The company’s reduction in fees follows the 10 per cent reduction of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the necessary mobility space to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company eases its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest work disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential for the economy of the region.
We need an economy that works for many and not just for a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country,” he said in the statement.
In 2016, the North Sea is expected to see fewer investments than $1.4 billion in new projects, while the five-year average has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Plejad cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete list of star rotation rates in the Plejad cluster.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at varying speeds, as well as how circulating times are associated with planetary formation.
We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even its solar system history,” said Luisa Rebull, Researcher at the Pasadena Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech, in a press release
The star cluster of the Plejads is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster have been born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now rotating at their top level.
At their peak rotational speed, these adult stars slam large amounts of stellar wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The list of recent star rotation speeds suggests that the most massive stars will spin slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars with dancers, of which the bigger make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
In the ”balet” of the plejads, we see that slowers tend to be more massive, while the fastest casters tend to be very light stars,” Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of Plejads is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
The star cluster of the plejades provides an anchor for the theoretical models of star rotation, which encompasses both directions, younger and older ones,” Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotation speed and so to speak hang their ‘dance shoes’ on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the rotational speeds of Plejads in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
