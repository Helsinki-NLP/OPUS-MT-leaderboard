Lacking junior physicians call for new industrial action
Representatives of the British junior physicians (who are mainly responsible for Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested permission for new industrial action in a new employment contract dispute.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Trade Union (BMA) is requesting support from its entire Board for additional work combat activities from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems related to the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in July.
58 % of the members who participated in the vote rejected the agreement.
President of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, published on Thursday evening a letter on Twitter sent to JDC members, in which he says that the government "conceivedly" issues that McCourt says led to the fight against the agreement.
The letter reads: "In this light, the JDC government has rejected a completely new proposal for a contract in its vote and calls for new formal negotiations on all our concerns.
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC government has today submitted an official request from the BMA government asking for permission for progressive industrial action from the beginning of September."
Due to the dispute, junior doctors have already been on strike six times this year, including the first complete work stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johan Malawana, Director of Junior Physicians at BMA, resigned from his position after his vote, as he did not accept the negotiated terms and conditions that BMA had recommended.
Malawana said in pre-vote meetings that the agreement was good and should be approved by 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement comes into force and applies to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: External Alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to make reconciliation and complete the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin accepted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I got a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The parties were shaking hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin and he wasn't quite soaked with heat even on his own restrained measure.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin – according to a report five times.
I didn’t keep up with the bills myself.
In addition, he promised that relations with Russia will return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, one of our country’s newspapers wrote Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian head has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction to the event time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara in strict terms and accused him of stabbing his back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain real trust.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, government-controlled media engaged in a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of top officials, according to which Erdogan’s own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled regions in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly forbidden the accusations.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it is time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was held only so that Putin received his apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could gain some kind of profit.
The benefits of disarmament to Ankara are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic influence for reconciliation.
Russian sanctions have struck Turkey with a strong ban on charter flights, as many millions of Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely sigh with ease as air traffic can eventually continue.
They put their faith in the rush of the late season in the Mediterranean Sea.
And still this week, government television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall when Turkish agricultural products are allowed to be imported again.
Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was written in an article by Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, as it thinks that the West reacts sluggishly to the coup attempt.
Not forgetting the old resentment of the forward-looking EU negotiations for Turkey and Putin’s failure to do things, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool gaps and erode Turkey’s ties to the west.
The Russian leader, without a doubt, won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident for Moscow, who has been worried about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey at their top meeting in a prime seaside palace could convey an image that an analyst described as an "outside alliance": two countries who feel that they have been abandoned and abused by the West will join forces.
Despite the public reconciliation, the two still have great disputes.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both Presidents said at a press conference that they had not dealt with the topic at all.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer the question of disputes between the countries, while Putin emphasised them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Considering the possibility of a full disaster caused by the NATO member state when shooting down a Russian fighter, it is no doubt better that after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are again in talk.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS Bank, the bank’s operations outside Scotland will be reduced so that in the future it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally joined the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to retreat from its objectives when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors international sports with millions of pounds, including Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now the foreground is considered to be more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be abbreviated as RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted to NatWest, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation for customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS turns into an investment brand and because of which our staff is working, because we are now becoming a much more bank of various brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their community, and our staff works with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring the Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
Now is the right time to switch to a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make a bank better for customers," says the bank's CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very tedious if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced the brands.
But our work and focus on customer needs instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to victory in Newmarket and reached his 3 000th victory
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, marking him 3 000th victory.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3 000th victory in the British championship in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory that evening on the track of his own locality, a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that reaches this milestone on a flat track in running races.
Previously Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson have been the same.
Triple master jockey dettori, who previously won in Ghayar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is also here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not any Royal Ascot, but a completely regular Friday night and a audience of 20 000 people.
I am relieved and feel great humility."
Dettori receives cheers with Prediction after his victory
The two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle racing competitions, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, 9x Derby winner, 4,493 wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that he just reached this milestone, which few have reached.
She is stylish and strong, but her tactical reach is what sets her apart from others.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and pruning has been bringing supporters to the sport for years."
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that she would already have won 6 000 races if she weren't to compete only on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie’s riding career in the UK has been victorious for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori ventilated his accomplishment in a characteristic way by jumping off his horse.
From flying to landings to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been a model example of British racing for two decades.
Ups and downs have been possible.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but has also survived a flight accident and been banned due to drug abuse.
When the ban on competition ended three years ago, he had difficulties starting up, but he showed admirable strength of character, showed his doubters and returned to his best.
And for a while he’s not stopping his career – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue racing until at least 50 years of age.”
Putin dismissed Chief of Administration Sergey Ivanovin
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his administrative manager Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin’s trusting insiders for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed as a special representative in environmental and transport matters.
According to a bulletin issued by the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov from his duties as President of the Russian Government, but no grounds for dismissal were given.
Anton Vaino, who has been Vice President of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the President’s protocol department and the Prime Minister’s Office, explains the Russian website of the Kremlin.
Vaino thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as a head of state, which means making draft laws and monitoring how to implement the instructions you provide."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are smiles real?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long belonged to Vladimir Putin's immediate circle, and, like Putin, he also has the KGB past.
As an administrator, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, the Russian state TV, each said that Ivanov would withdraw from the task at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince only a few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are the kicks the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very distrustful of the formal argument that a man praised as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me this very complicated and somewhat even tricky task for four years.
Now I have been the President’s administrator for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service (KGB).
When Putin served as the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) that replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
As Putin entered power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second period of Putin, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from choosing for the third period.
However, the mission went to Dmitri Medvedeville, another member of Putin's immediate circle.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to president only three and a half years later.
Star of the Criminal Minds – FBI Researchers series Thomas Gibson kicked off after hitting the producer
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, shared the kicks in their joint press release.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner in the series, had made an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced.
We had creative disagreements.
I regret this," he says in his press release.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, will be disclosed in a press release by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old Gibson, previously featured in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been involved in the series since the first season of its production, i.e. since 2005.
I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and my soul on it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in a release published on Friday.
I wished I could see the series until the end, but it is no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the screenwriters, producers, actors, our amazing production team and the most important ones: the best fans of the series could ever have wished for."
The 12th season of the series will start in the United States on September 28th.
Mysterious landing of fish in Banff Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are windfishes that have landed in a whirlwind.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published a vision in Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the appearance of these five-centimetres of fish.
Queensferry Overpass Now Connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and land of the Queensferry transit bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "cover fans" which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tons of steel and 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 rope ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Minister Keith Brown, who is responsible for the economy, visited the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from land to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historical and symbolic moment to build the Queensferry Overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in building the bridge, with more than 30 000 concrete and steel used to build this section alone.
Despite the magnitude and weight, the construction of the bridge between the landlock and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely accurate installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete deck casting in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted into place."
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant milestone in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the pinnacle of the road and civil engineering industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the North Tower road cover, we then had to close the left-out North (i.e., the ground-side) gap.
This was done by pulling the northern land 700 millimetres southward.
This was a massive operation requiring high precision at the same time.
Massive, because the country has a length of 222 meters and a weight of about 6 000 tons and had to be drawn up at an angle of incline of about 3 percent.
And high precision demands because the tolerances that the work team had to follow were very small – just a few millimeters.
It all went well, fortunately."
Molefre Bay Rescue Department Tells You About Three Men's Miracle Rescue
Anglesey, in front of his fishing boat, three men were saved as if in a miracle shop.
The sea rescue station of Molefre RNLI made an alarm on Friday at 13.20 a.m. local time after its crew spotted an accident in the Gulf of Molefre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim in safety while their boat continued reckless passage without a pilot.
We saw the boat walking right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives the Lifeboat of Molefre.
By the time we got into the water, the strong winds had fortunately led the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat rescued two men, while the third, aged 60, was found clinging to the buoy and without a lifejacket.
They were all picked up in a coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a wonder that these three men who have been on the water are still alive and in perfect condition.
The boat's engine had an emergency quench cord, but for some reason it had disconnected from the man who was driving the boat when he fell.
They were really lucky in their journey."
Pokémon Go Hunt Brings Health and Happiness
It is fascinating to follow how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have complained why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside to stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and move around.
Originally, screen time was only spent watching TV, then there were video games and most recently smartphones.
So it is great to note that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
This, of course, refers to the Pokémon Go craze, and Pokémon Go is a game app with characters from a 1990s video game (which later became a drawing set, playing cards, and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also ended a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to huge interest that overloaded servers.
In just a few days, the number of users in Pokémon Go passed Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out on their smartphones to search for pokémons that are tracked by GPS; when you find a pokémon, it can be "photographed" (with the help of the phone screen) or "capture".
The craze has drawn the generation who played the video game at a younger age and lifted the buttocks from the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" in a day.
The Washington Post reported recently, an Apple Watch Cardiogram app that found within two days of the launch of the game that the number of people moving for 30 minutes per day suddenly increased from 45% to 53%, followed by 35 000 users.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns, in which people are encouraged to get up from the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have echoed on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be diminished.
With regular movements, the probability of developing cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large amount of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people out do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic things that support health – exercise, fresh air and the sun and joy.
During the yacht, it is even possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes disgusting spoilers.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door while playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough has been made.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track your activity before, they didn’t give you reason to start, as Pokémon Go does.
The charm of novelty disappears, and the use decreases in time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games where apps and virtual reality will be combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people going on yachts and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget about hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortless with a boom.
Jaws clashing with perma.
Great for everything.
And now finally also the Olympic winner.
The American 19-year-old gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday and increased the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His overall score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the bronze medalist of Russia Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles from the United States will perform at the US barrier at the Women’s Stand Gymnastics Multimatch on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and all-time fifth American woman to win the multi-match championship, confirming his reputation as the best of his generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears when his total final score appeared and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to new heights and brings him to the same class as other superstars in sports, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 World Championship medals, 10 gold medals, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programmes that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called her "the most powerful gymnast ever."
In Brazil, there was still one last race, which took place first and foremost between Biles and his burden of self-expectation, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring in Texas less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
American Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman hug gold and silver after winning the women’s gymnastics multi-match on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of i for those who have coordinated the national team and now retireed from Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanent program, which includes a series of volts known as his trump card, is adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It is not a coincidence.
His grandparents had already adopted and coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a powerful figure, and he found her on a day care trip in the gym where he coached.
He hasn’t lost any multi-match competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got into a small lead with two twists, it was like a weaving.
Left were the boom and the floor, where Biles is a defending world champion.
He made his way back to the leadership position after receiving 15,433 points from the boom and crowned the end result with 15,933 points from the floor.
He was gently hugged by Raisman as they waited for the final points – which was mere formality – and tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white, and blue glittering framing color, when the dream he once wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman’s performance was a small reverence to the competition four years ago when he first split the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in a re-spin.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call the team "granny" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent out flight kisses to the audience after his permanto programme, thus becoming a winner from a loss station, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
When it comes to Biles, tweeting this 19-year-old earlier in the week and widespread now has a whole new meaning:
The police report three victims of a serial killer who listened to music in the car
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre for ten years, while the victims sat chatting in the car and listening to music when shot, says a police release published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on June 12, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot into a car parked on the street.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, from where he shot eight shots with a handgun and then fled by another car, the announcement says.
The police suspect that the cause of the triple death was probably not a robbery, because the attacker did not take handbags or the $2 900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix Police Officer, Sergeant Jonathan Howard says the police are now investigating if the killing is related to four previously made attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded by nine attacks, which have mainly occurred in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
It is common for events to have happened in residential areas in front of homes," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, late 1990s black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers don’t want to reveal what made them infer that the attacks are related to each other and that their creator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that the threesome had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a press release stating that the fire was only half an hour before the trip was killed, and the shooter is expected to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found sockets and recovered the bullet from the car seat and the bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephalia: "Things get better"
Like most 6 year olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephalic, or congenital minority, due to the emotional disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, which he was not aware of when pregnant.
When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I can’t make it out of this.
I can't make it out of this.
I am not committed to this.
What’s not true at all – of course you’re committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
My first reaction was that I didn't think such a practice would be at all," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a rollator.
Edmund got up and began to crawl only at the age of 3, and he still does not speak.
But he progresses slowly at his own pace.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
She likes to play with two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents a sign country invented by Edmund, which means "singing to me".
We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean ordinary sign language, but also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephalia can be caused by several different diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund's case, or pregnancy virus infections such as measles or zikavirus.
The symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people with Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
I was constantly taking care of: how we do,
how do we do."
And he still doesn’t know.
I haven't asked for a prognosis, for I don't think that anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by zikavirus.
"That's getting better.
Things tend to be organized.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused major rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi states
On Friday, the Louisiana Governor declared an emergency due to heavy rains and widespread floods, and more rainfall in the state is expected on Saturday.
According to the national weather service, several rivers in South-East Louisiana and South Mississippi flooded their banks and spread over a wide area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on their way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, Communications Officer at the National Emergency Power Agency, says that the agency receives requests for flooded vehicles, boats and sand bags.
According to Steele, only the district of Tangipahoa has asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most parts of South Louisiana.
According to a release issued by the weather service, there may be an additional 76–127 mm of water entering the area.
A flood warning was issued in South Alabama on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, near the Comite River, near Baton Rouge and the Amite River, near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many riverside houses may be flooded under the flood in suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that floods downstream in Ascension County pose a threat, as flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, the Tickfaw River, which flows to the south of the state of Mississippi, had already risen at 9 a.m. on Friday.
The rescue work continued in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were earlier on Friday close to the Glosteria rescued.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose quickly during the night.
The other son who lived near had warned him.
We got up, and water came with constant feed," says Hansford.
It reached to my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high during the 48 years she has lived in the region.
Hansford says that he and his family all have injuries, and he himself is the only one with swimming skills.
Rescue workers had rescued all three large military-style trucks and taken them to the fire station Gloster, where they kept the shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says floods spread rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation regulations.
He tells about the information obtained from the observer near Livingston, according to which almost 350 mm had rained between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil was drenched heavily after the rains that began on Wednesday.
According to the authorities, due to the flooding of heavy rains and streets, the residents of the district of Tangipao had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangipaoa had told the subsidiary WWL of the television and radio company CBS that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
Robby Miller, the County Director, says that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
Shelters for the evacuated have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to withdraw," he says.
In the city of Hammond, in the district of Tangipaoa, nearly twenty streets had to be closed due to flooding, and the residents were offered sandbags to try and prevent water from entering their homes and business premises.
For the last time, we experienced a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Board.
This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, the rain continued steadily along the Gulf of Mexico’s coast, says Rupert Lacy, rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy says that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported under a flood, but on Friday there had been no news.
Shopper Value Foods store manager Keith Townson says he has lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
I have seen water in places I have never seen before, and more rain all the time."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who received several bullets in his body, survives Philadelphia's firing incident
According to the police, six-year-olds have been shot in Philadelphia, which is already another six-year-old, who has been shot this week in the city.
The grandparents of the child reported on the CBS Philadelphia channel that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had several wounds in the groin, leg, arm and stomach, but he was aware when he was taken to the hospital.
He had many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said his son's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
I can't believe it."
The boy is in a critical state of the hospital, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was about to start his first class in the local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two men aged 29 and one man aged 32 were also subjected to fire.
The second 29-year-old state was declared to be critical and the other two states were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found on the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could be a shooter.
The police researchers told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The venue was full of assault weapon-type sockets that originated from various assault weapons.
It is perfectly clear that this was a ongoing battle.
On the street were sockets on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present, and they have been actively involved in shooting," said Anthony Ginaldi, Chief Commissioner of the Philadelphia Police, to the TV station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and according to the hearing the police go through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old in the city, who had fallen victim to shooting, hit the hand as he played a bullet in front of his home in West Oak Lane on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simonea, Gabbya and Laurieta
By this name, I call the women’s gymnastics Olympic team, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as superior as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team composition, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been afro American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is awesome.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became a surprise winner, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as well as the surprising and masterful gymnastics programs.
Simone became the fourth consecutive American on Thursday to win gold in the women’s individual competition multi-match.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
The views are such at the top of the sport, but at the same time, the gymnastics classes do not look like they are all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as the next gymnastics Olympic team will have only four gymnasts, and this is the last year of Marta Karoly as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts mainly practice in private gymnastics clubs maintained by their parents.The parents are paid for training costs, facilities, travel, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members) etc.
The facilities of most gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy residential areas that are able to support the activities.
The teaching of gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both coached sport enthusiasts since they started gymnastics.
We have to organize more affordable and better-available gymnastics lessons for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm Simone, Gabby and Laurie have aroused.
I founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have offered free or affordable gymnastics for more than 15 000 city youths (mostly black and Latin Americans), and some of them have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality scaffolding gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.
Stand gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings sustainable benefits for the whole life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has aroused enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnastics, and it is absolutely awesome.
Participating in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl force" you showed when winning Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls from their backgrounds to become well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepared for new strikes
The ministers hoped that they would decide on the changes to the dispute’s remuneration and terms of employment by approving the renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58 per cent of the junior physicians who participated in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister of Health Hunt announced plans to force an agreement and said that the British public health system (NHS) was "not in any country" and that all further delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in times of social exclusion.
Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Committee for Junior Physicians, gave a statement yesterday, saying: "Junior doctors continue to take a very prepared approach to the proposed agreement, with a particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It’s only eight weeks since the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now you have to get ahead, as the time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has acted unwillingly and sometimes without reacting in any way.
That’s how Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door is always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the contract and respond to the concerns of junior physicians.
If this does not happen, junior doctors are ready for new industrial action."
At the end of April, the previous strike postponed almost 13 000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointments when nurses and consultative doctors were asked to support the strikers to the strike guard.
The ministers hoped to complete the dispute on change by signing a renewed agreement with the officials of the British trade union representing doctors.
Trade Union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 junior doctors who would be covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, Executive Director of NHS employees, appealed to junior physicians not to start a new strike.
Mortimer says: "Work-fighting achieves very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services that already operate at the extremes and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, nursing staff and their families.
We have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee for the past two months, and together with the Ministry of Health and Others, we have welcomed their concerns about the task of the supervisor and the disclosure of shortcomings.
The employees were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important topics – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, educational costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study-free and gender pay gap in the care sector – were a sign of how seriously employees, Health Education England, who is responsible for education in the health sector, and the Ministry of Health want to adhere to agreements with BMA in November, February and May."
A medicine that costs approximately 2.40 € per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are receiving a medicine that costs about €2.40 per day, when the authorities recommend that it be given to more people and for longer-term use.
Anticoagulant tikagrelori reduces the risk of new heart attacks in heart disease patients.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) is part of the British public health system (NHS) and has been instructing patients that ticagrelo should be administered for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) is part of the UK’s public health system (NHS) and evaluating the introduction of new treatment methods, has been instructing patients that ticagrelor should be administered for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, there are around 140 000 heart attacks in England, about a quarter of which the heart attack renews or they get a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the fat that accumulates in the walls of the blood vessels, which generates plaques.
If plaque tears, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood plug is released, it can travel with the bloodstream and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new scene is higher for people who have received a heart attack once.
The tikagrelore produced by the British AstraZeneca, which is sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
In today’s NICE draft guidelines, it is recommended to give ticagrelo for next 90 mg for 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams and in addition to giving aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Carole Longson, Professor at the Centre for the Evaluation of Treatment Methods (NICE), says: "Although effective treatment methods are available to prevent the progress of the disease and the emergence of symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have received a heart attack will receive a new scene or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on human quality of life.
We have received evidence that tikagrelori combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Recommendation for the temporary use of tikagrelor for more treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
As information on the efficacy and safety of the tikkagrelor, in particular with regard to the risk of bleeding, is limited if it is used for more than three years, it is not recommended to use the treatment method for a longer period of time in the draft guidance.
Due to the atmosphere that fosters political correctness, voting fraud in Muslim regions flourished
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year for corruption, as a result of which the government made a report
The atmosphere cherishing political correctness led to eye closure from widespread election fraud in Muslim communities, reveals a government report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles severely criticised the police, election observers and city councils for having closed their eyes to election fraud for "oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
According to Pickles, who was known as the former Minister of Regional Administration and the current anti-corruption force figure, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside the polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should submit evidence of their identity in order to be able to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter only needs to state their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to dip fingers in in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
More whistleblowers should be protected, says Sir Eric.
He demands that journalists’ access to documents and decisions of informal boards and working groups be improved.
The aim is not only to prevent election fraud, but also to combat fraud and a culture that favours corruption and economic interests in local governments more broadly," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the East London Tower Hamlet voting scandal.
Last year, the special election court ordered that then mayor Lutfur Rahman should resign from his duties due to corruption and numerous illegal procedures.
The court considered that Rahman "skewed ridiculously" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and suppressed his review by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamicism.
Rahman was said to "use his campaign as the basis of the religious obligation of every believer to vote for him."
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulently given in such a way that the person voted by pretending to be someone else.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was obtained throughout the country.
He expressed his particular concern about postal fraud, in which the high-ranking members of the Muslim community were told to pressure people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requesting an identity document at the polling station.
The report states: "It has been established that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the wishes of the parents, particularly in the context of the Pakistan and Bangladesh communities."
We were concerned that... state institutions had closed their eyes on such activities because of the oversensitivity to the ethnicity and religion of the "politically correct"."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including baning the handling of postal voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent "sound harvesting".
The report currently under review by Theresa May also requires stricter checks in connection with the registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Considering options where voters would be required to present an identity document before voting.
Dip your fingers into the ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibiting the handling of filled mailed voices and mail envelopes from political activists.
The police have the right to form guard chains around the polling stations.
Amendments to the law in such a way that raising intimidation charges is easier under the 1986 Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only allowing English at polling stations (except Wales).
Enhancing training in order to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person can go to the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric harshly criticizes London's policeman and finds it "amazing" that after the case of Tower Hamlet, no criminal charges were raised.
The electoral court separated Lutfur Rahman and his representative from his duties due to corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
He was found guilty without any doubt, and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticised the ineffective "ticking checks" of the departments responsible for the electoral lists of the City Council.
In the case of Tower Hamlet, the court's decision last year was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and concealed election fraud and its denial by some parties."

CBC Olympic commentator apologises after saying "dead like a pig" of a Chinese swimmer
Byron MacDonalds’ analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan instead of the fourth in the women’s 4 x 200-metre freestyle message stunned CBC’s spectators in the live Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "lost smells" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to slam his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 meter freestyle message final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC report team, was heard saying: "This tiny 14 year old Chinese dick, baby.
It was too excited, left and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam during the second part of the message 1:57.79, and stayed 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck in Canada, allowing Canadians to swim in China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly after shocking at the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot did not realize that he was still in the broadcast."
In the final of the women’s 4 x 200 meter freestyle message, the Chinese Ai Yanhan was described with the following words: “This tiny 14 year old Chinese dick, baby.
Twitter quickly filled up with rage at Byron MacDonald's criticizing comments, and many demanded his dismissal.
Tweeters did not hold back their words when they heard how disregardless Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly regretted MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment on swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
In the end, CBC had to apologize more than 90 times for people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to make apologies for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued its apologies to more than 90 other Tweeters who complained about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
We are sincerely sorry, for these statements and for having been sent.
We quickly apologize to our viewers for the last night, and we also apologize to our social media followers.
For clarity, Byron's comments related to the performance of a swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be complained, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night MacDonald made his apologies at the broadcast and tried to defend his speeches by saying that he didn’t mean it to be personal.
I want to apologize for my comment I gave yesterday evening after women's message swim," MacDonald said in CBC's Olympic broadcast.
I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Needless to say, I meant nothing degrading with my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, without blocking the underwear in the middle of the store, the woman shocked customers
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to fit the briefs.
He further aggravated the situation by assessing what he looked like in the underpants, taking them off the leg and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued touring and finally tried four pairs of briefs at the shop in Folkestone in Bouverie Place.
The shop of the Primark chain in Folkestone's Bouverie Place Shopping Mall, where a woman tried the panties in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store, says that after trying out underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says about what happened: "People were not to believe in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the shop, took the briefs out of the shelf, stripped her own tights and underpants, and put them on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but did it without shame.
Everyone stared as he took off the underwear he tried, and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three times again before finally deciding that he didn’t like them anything, dressed up and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care for the eyes – and he didn’t think of the person who would finally buy the briefs he had come to.”
Davidson, a 33-year-old living in Kent town, continues: "How awful to think that someone takes a pair of briefs to his home that someone else has used and not been washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
I have understood that the store staff tried to remove those pieces of clothing from the sale when the woman had left – what is right.
It would be awful to take the new briefs home and notice that someone else has tried them without having washed them since," adds Davidson.
The Primark spokesperson commented: "Primark is aware of the situation in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August.
All of these products have been discontinued."
How to defend yourself against armed aggression with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grandmaster of Krav Maga in New York and asked how to cope with a rifle waving robber or assaulter in close proximity.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing to do is to turn around to see the attacker and get away from the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon so that it stays between your forearm and your arm, and strike the attacker with your free forearm.
Then kick the attacker on the knee to the groin, and when he goes out of the pain twice, sweep him on the face with a gun barrel and retreat by keeping the weapon directed at him.
The technique is similar if the armed attacker approaches the front, you have to move away from the shooting line, grab the gun and rotate it so that the attacker cannot trigger.
At the same time, place your weight in the weapon and strike the attacker with your fists in the chest, turn the weapon away from the attacker’s grasp, retreat and keep the weapon targeted to the attacker.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
However, remember that you can get rid of the robber by handing over your cash – unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Ian Wright, a travel guide-making globetrotter licking the dirtiest places in Europe
The British globetrotter put his resistance and chaotic reflex to the test by licking the most dirty and repulsive places in Europe.
Suffolk presenter and tour operator Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking the euro banknotes, handrails in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on the train’s toilet and a Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and show the viewers where I was forbidden to push.
The experiment was made into a documentary film Ian Wright – in the imprint of inner force, and its results surprised.
The idea of licking the flush button in the train toilet can be aching, but in fact, more bacteria are present in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals to prepare good intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused but a bad-tasting mouth.
Ian Wright originally came from his well-known travel program, where he tested the endurance of his gut by traveling around the world and eating strange and wondrous things.
Without a doubt, the handrails of the railway stations and the flush button of the toilet challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the documentary: "I have been quite carefree about my health since my child and put everything in my mouth, such as soil, worms and mud water."
In the film, he really showed that he was equal to his reputation.
The border only crossed the public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units of the sample.
For comparison, it should be noted that in newly washed hands, the amount is usually less than 60.
The border was met in a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured the result 4000 units – in newly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures together with Valio in a documentary film Ian Wright – on the tracks of inner force, where the number of bacteria is made visible in various places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary: "This is almost a horrible smell I've smelled in any toilet.
4000 units! Nothing is dirtier than that!
The place is so upset that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film Ian Wright – in collaboration with Valio.
From Valio Wright received Valio Gefilu, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut’s good bacterial base and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s category manager for snack, juice and novelty products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time brainstorming something crazy, and finally we ended up asking Ia for the idea."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider connection and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of bowel health, and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and with the help of a document, we can provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells our sense of humour!"
Tom Hakala, the director of the film, adds: "It is said that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the weaving Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, some items were easier to lick for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some dirty lickers to shoot on the tape."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84% of respondents attached lactic acid bacteria, especially to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they used products with lactic acid bacteria at least once in a while.
The troubled family destroyed the city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall before their eviction
The troubled family left behind the damage of £50 000 to a town-owned rental house after they had been evictioned due to the terror of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evictioned from their Cornwall apartment in Saltash after numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple had been forced to leave the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company found the apartment to be in renovation condition.
There were gaping gaps in the walls, floor boards had been torn off, garbage had been spread on the floors and the walls had been frowned with graffiti.
The couple has now changed and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, Head of Cornwall Housing, says he is afraid that an apartment may no longer be saved.
He says: "This has been a full nightmare for the people living here, no one should have to tolerate this.
There is a lot to weigh on, as the property is likely to become known not as a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three boys living in the apartment from time to time, according to the police, the tyranny of the family involved street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, the use and transmission of drugs, and loud shouting, quarreling and swearing.
In June, Skeldon, 47 years old, signed the lease agreement, received an order for non-social behaviour.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under the demolition threat.
Drugs had previously been sold from the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family brawled on the street and the police had to regularly call the scene.
Cornwall’s housing agency forced the couple to leave this week after giving them 11 weeks of extra time to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction – they said their lives were terrestrial hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care for anyone.
We have lived with their neighbor for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we are not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Vice President for Compulsory Enforcement at Cornwall Housing Agency, says that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were invited to the place on a regular basis.
The rubbish and old toys had been thrown into the wild walls of the house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a loss that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own and his or her family's behaviour, as eviction is always the last measure that Cornwall's Housing Agency considers.
This case was very difficult, as behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to watch the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members who participated in the work and boldly offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this advance will improve the well-being of the neighbors and give a message that non-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick says that the three boys of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already twenty.
A dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after eviction
Home workers must now clean up the piles of waste around the house.
In 2014, the police raided the apartment and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, scales and other supplies, as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined when he was found guilty of class B drug possession with the intention of selling it.
He claimed that the money was for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard of moving into a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the rooms had been ruined with graffiti.
The police say that they require eviction for tenants who violate the rules of lease agreements.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall police says this eviction is a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
This is a clear message for those who think they can behave how they want without any charge, as well as those who have to suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach-bound army jet frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion, the Portuguese Air Force, crashed into a strikingly low plane.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were exhausted when a low-flying jet crashed over the full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army airplane comes almost to a contact distance from tourists sunbathing on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers got up on their feet as they were worried about the thunder of the jet engines, which began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the holidaymakers who photographed a dramatic passer-by and published videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed the beach twice on a really low level, and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash to the ground."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I was sure that the machine would fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a stunningly low level.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which was why the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal, because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires hampered visibility, but according to the Air Force, it did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Excoten first-half result better than expected
The South Karelian Social and Health District (Eksote) made a better result than planned in January - June of EUR 3.4 million.
Exote's result was EUR 4.3 million surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to decompose institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues for measures.
The exote covers the deficit that was previously generated by the surplus.
The excess from it may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Jaegers swore a military oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School swore a military oath on Friday.
On Friday at Immola, a military event was held for the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School.
The oath ceremony for the tenth special cross-border jaeger course was held on the garrison’s sports field.
The military oath was sworn by 70 conscripts.
Special Border Jaegers are trained in demanding border management, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve for 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for the special border jaeger.
For entrance examinations, 250 of them were invited.
Special cross-border jägers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting held in connection with the oath event involved five veterans of the war-time border forces.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A slate of robbery ahead - crime intelligence helps in investigating crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has been operating a RTA, i.e. a criminal investigation and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is led by a superconstal located in Lahti.
The Chief Executive is Commissioner in Lahti.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian person dedicated to computer science in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civil outfit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports to the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has acquired information about asylum seekers, among other things.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the most recent reform of the police’s working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. the fact that the police would run out less and less of the straw only when they receive an alarm.
With the help of the data collected and analyzed by the unit, daily police operations are targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, less than three national units, and each police department its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR centre, operating in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, manages operations nationally.
As the name implies, the PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Enquiry extends beyond your own area
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is the RTA unit’s task to know what is happening throughout the entire police department.
The inquiry also extends beyond the boundaries of one’s own institution, because it also commits crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, alarm task database and observations, the unit aims to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, prolific criminal offences or similar offences.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint can also be seen at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, a certain image of the author is formed.
Serialisation can be carried out either on the basis of the way of doing or on the basis of the person, depending on which of the police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not move around the city’s collars, but their work is not entirely public.
Both their own and the methods used by criminals are not reported because it could lead to professional criminals developing their operations and thus trying to prevent police crime prevention attempts.
The police will report on the methods in public if they predict that they will pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the marking of empty dwellings, which was reported in early summer and used in housing breaks.
In it, the workers put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape in the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents are really traveling.
The pre-trial investigation material is public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
For example, the clever ones will order a District Court minutes, which may indicate that fingerprints have been found in the place.
Next time, you go to the thieves with gloves in your hand.
Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppä from the Häme Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
In the background, the decrease in labour and financing volumes.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken already 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-renewal PORA, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects data from outside the borders of one’s own institution and Finland.
London schoolgirl who joined the fathers was killed in Syria
The news says that one of the British schools that joined the Isis last three years, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasname Akunjee tells her family that Sultana died in Raqqa in Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian airstrike at Raqqa, the base of Isis in Syria, said ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, was planning to flee from a country ravaged by war and return to Britain.
One can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and testament, so that people would understand that this is a real risk when entering the war zone - and that makes people give up the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a plane to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected
President of the Senate, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as the Supreme Court’s judge if he is elected president.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to Mitch McConnell, President of the Senate, the next president chooses a person who is to fill the seat of the former Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a phone conference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton to choose Garland with "a fairly high degree of certainty".
Reid's spokesman later specified that this was speculation only and that Reid hadn't spoken directly with Clinton whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garlandia and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "wind the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the main judge of the U.S. Petition Court in the District of Columbia.
Reid states that the Republicans who prevent Garland's appointment are "conscripts" and "contributors" of Donald Trump, the presidential candidate.
He says that Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats, nude calendars are as well for women as for men
Treats magazine co-operates with photographer David Bellemere and launches a 1970s style calendar inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of the celebrity nude models, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nakedness leaves differ from the old school's Playboy journals, as he says: "Playboy is for men.
I'll do this to women."
Apparently he thinks about the calendar as well.
We have to bring back the timeless and classic nudity, where women, wherever men, can without bothering to enjoy these female body images and be inspired by them," says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"Women are sure to want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful piece of art."
Those wishing to submit their photos online or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl Charm: Who Buys Discs?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can enter your angry objection in the comment section under the name of your angry objections, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov, there is no millennial-generation boom behind the much talked about new vinyl records when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is a middle age nostalgia behind it.
Recently, the age of a person who bought a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, 18–24 age groups are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just the desire of enthusiasts to pick up records, but the importance is emotional: older vinyl record buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions hidden (56% in 53% in 53% in 53% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (66% in 66%).
But do youGov’s results come true?
If this blog was a television broadcast, the camera would follow me as I walk along the lively Soho Street, wearing a rugged grey jacket, cheering me up, bending my hand into a cup and saying something traditional like: "Let's find out."
So let’s find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and roughness when hotels, Eats, Prets, and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, a handful of specialty record stores remain.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I look very close to the men visiting these stores and try to assess their age and character.
Stuart, 55 from Glasgow, followed by Sister Ray (at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) for Reckless Records (at the moment eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-year-old women) are on a conference trip in London during the afternoon and spend their extra time exploring the shops.
I ask if he is a collector.
I think I'm," he says.
I have about 3000 to 4000 disks."
These plates fill his living room wall, as the picture shows. (Stuart sent me an email, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his available income, he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they initially appeared, and buy again the things he had to sell when young and unfunded.
I got a lot of things in the late 60s and early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who will enjoy themselves, and adds: "I won't burn, and I won't drink much.
That's my vice."
Wez, 25 working at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit into your YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new flow of people that media hype has affected; these people have heard of the coming of vinyl records again and now feel forced to buy back their old records.
Based on my discussions, people had usually abandoned their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This may explain the boom of certain vinyl-heroed people of certain ages.
And then, what about the alleged emotional meaning of the sound discs?
In just a few seconds, it realizes in a movement like Phonica that they provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly displeased with the contactless payment system.
The digital world may stupend some vinyl fans, for whom returning to the well-known record cases means permanence and reminds of the lucky days of youth.
I think it sometimes fills up a gap or material property for some comfort," says Wez.
This is how I see it as a collector myself, and I believe that so many others too.
It's an easy way to get thoughts elsewhere."
We're like social workers!" says Wez's co-worker from behind the pile of plates.
The ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of those who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
An opinion poll also said that 41% is a turntable they never use, and 7% of vinyl record buyers don’t have their own turntable at all.
At this point, I would probably look like a serious face while browsing the stackable bossa nova collections.
The new coming of vinyl records is also accompanied by a "trophy" phenomenon, observed by the seller Jonny, 42 of the Sounds of the Universe (at the moment three middle-aged men).
A customer recently came in and said he doesn’t have a turntable, but he wants to buy a Radiohead so he can put it on his shelf,” Jonny says.
”The share of such customers is not high, but there are nonetheless.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don’t have a turntable yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Foppi, where I will arrive next, and the store has dedicated a whole floor to vinyl records.
The clients include seventy-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers delights, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as it is in the previous movements: instead of rocking the speakers, the newest synthesizer from Wild Beasts.
None of the clients looks particularly lonely, but it is difficult to establish a revolving psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and looking at different plates on sale.
He is rather looking than shopping.
He says his income is small, so it is not possible for him to collect the discs.
They cost a lot.
Music is easy to listen to on the computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is..." she lets in a delightful sigh and continues:
I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I notice a group of teenage girls who would think they’d be jumping on a pair of denim shorts, but who instead gather for a moment around Polaroid cameras, I see a father and daughter who were thinking about buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase filled with a wall filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key plates for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they are just an interior element and some are so high that they do not even reach.
They are pure "art vinyl" decor.
But considering that all the means to get attention to these discs may mean more money to the industry and send a few customers for a search trip to Soho, there is hardly any reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population that is most likely to have more time and money than most is also the group that spends the most money on luxuries, such as vinyl records.
Although my research shows that youGov’s results are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be close to school or working life.
At least they won’t spend their mornings on Thursdays in the record shops of Berwick Street, browsing the records and avoiding the 30-year-old television presenter staring terrifyingly and looking at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The archer, i.e. the ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate – video report
According to researchers, the world’s longest living vertebrate is an ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark for the age was studied for 272–512 years, which was a five-metre female.
French Court Rejected Application for Demolition of Jungle Camp Trades
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities, in which they demand the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants at a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
The Calais authorities put forward in this week’s court proceedings claims that the state should be allowed to break down the 72 temporary shops established for the refugee camp. The shops sell different types of tobacco to the residents of the refugee camp for energy drinks and offer haircuts. From temporary restaurants you can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the Calais Prefect Authority, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian adjutants told the court that shops and restaurants are necessary for the camp, as the free meals provided by the state-subsidised organisation and other parties are not enough for the ever-growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free food for those in need.
The Lille court decided that there was no legal basis for deporting the 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Calais prefect to be ‘fully understandable’.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the food shops, cafes and restaurants in the camp are of much greater importance than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the threat of dismantling was the Jungle Book Kids cafe in the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors whose position is the most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed an address where a children’s café is required to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, its closure "would be a disaster to these children, some of whom are only 8 years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated that after a sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record-breaking population of more than 9,000 people.
Food prices drop significantly faster in Finland than in the EU on average
In Finland, food degrades sharply to the joy of consumers and the harm of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has decreased by almost five per cent in three years, while in EU countries, the price of food decreased by 0.9 per cent on average.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen to the second highest level in the EU countries that have the same wage level as in Finland.
Only in the UK has the price of food decreased faster than in Finland.
The information is provided by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager at Statistics Finland, who was published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared the real prices, i.e. the prices proportioned to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the price level in 1994.
The situation was alarming.
We were close to losing the price advantage that came with the EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed a turnaround, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now weighed down by the bans on imports of food imposed by Russia, which have caused food exports from Finland to Russia to stop.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products in the Finnish market has increased and the producer prices of agricultural products have decreased.
Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
The tightened price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price decline.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been shown as impressive advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not the location of inexpensive food, even though the price of food has declined a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland, with the same level of pay as in Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell the third cheapest food in terms of wage levels in Finland.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, we must halve the value added tax to the average level of EU countries and continue price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations with VAT percentage are indicative.
School is no longer quite its former
Those returning to the school bench may notice that the school has undergone a change during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline according to which all Finnish schools operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New instructions have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, the teaching of the fiction is abandoned, and instead, coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education begins to be read already in four.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
In this way, we try to make school more interesting.
The longest-lasting vertebrate found in the world - the ice shark can live up to 400 years
Also known as Somniosus microcephalus (Greenland shark), the ice shark reaches maturity only at the age of 150.
It can then live for 250 years, reports a new study.
The numbers make the sport the longest-lasting vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenlandic sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
As the pace of growth is slow, according to the follow-up, only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females who had been trapped in fisherman gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon timing of the eye lenses.
The average age of the examined sharks proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493 and 502 centimetres, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach their maturity by more than four metres, researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fires almost 300 - sellers are not reduced
Almost 300 employees will be dismissed from Stockmann’s department store company.
The joint ventures in the company that was run into difficulties ended at the beginning of August.
As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 workplaces will be reduced, most of which will be carried out as redundant,” says Stockmann in its press release.
According to it, the number of department store sellers is not reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, about 80 employees of support functions are offered new work as a seller.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3 000 employees.
At the start of these, the need for deduction was estimated to be approximately 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims at annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann’s difficulty in getting profitable from the department store.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the department store still makes a loss.
According to Stockmann’s acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," says Veijalainen in a press release.
The result improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of Lindex’ clothing chain.
The chain achieved its net sales and results for the second quarter of the year.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy Friday,” says Ilona Láng, meteorologist at HS.
There will also be rain showers in the middle of the country, but there will be a waterfall in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, you stay 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan athletics team shakes doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach’s campaign
The Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah appeared as a team athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP said that the athlete that Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan national team leadership, told him that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample as Rotichi in the surprise test.
The doping officials reported to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soin Anzrah was sent home, for he "did his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such use," said Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, to Reuters, the news agency.
The Olympic athletics begins on Friday, and Rotich is set to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences due to the case.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is a pre-Rio favourites.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah went on an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed that he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to be revealed," said the source.
Where are everyone?
Rio athletics stadium rubberizes its emptiness
Where are all right?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium following athletics.
On Friday in Rio, the struggle for athletics medals began, but the world’s top individuals were able to showcase their skills to an empty auditorium.
On Friday, Rio announced that only 58 percent of the first-day morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium stunned the cheering crowd.
Tickets for the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The lack of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazil’s medal wish at Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the stadium was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the 12 000-person stands were full of about 30 per cent.
It is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which struggles with financial difficulties, is far away from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get the football stadium fully drawn.
In the weekend, the organizers’ spokesman Mario Andrada told us that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
There are still 1.1 million remaining for sale," said Andrada, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets of the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to more than one thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, as organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240 000 tickets to lesser-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places in Rio Stadium in the morning.
Even a beach volleyball on the sands of Copacabana is not interested in the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There was plenty of people on the leaves.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically significant nature areas.
After that, private, business and corporations can redeem holders’ rights to land for money.
The foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to have a right of ownership against payment.
In practice, the holder is granted a veto over its 187-square-metre block, which means that not every holder is required to be approved if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holders can also be purchased for more than one block.
Obtaining a right of possession is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
There is no need to start carrying banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," says Juha Leviakangas, who has acquired the right of possession for his company.
The right of possession obtains precise location information from the block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the name of the holders of possession rights can be found on the same map where the group information for the land area can be found.
Levikangas sees that its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would somehow operate unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land areas either as a purchase or donation.
It mainly funds its operations through the sale of holder rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves are the worst in Turku – see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves are the worst hit by Turku by the biggest cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in relation to the number of residents than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bike theft reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated the amount of bicycles and parts of them stolen per thousand inhabitants in the ten largest cities in January-August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two bike theft per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
After all, that’s a big difference.
In other cities, the number of double thefts is proportioned to the number of residents," says Tommi Reen, Police Inspector at the National Police Board.
The City of Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to it.
The generality of theft can be influenced by the amount of bikes in the city and how many bikes there are in general," says Chief Officer Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the National Police Board, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bike theft goes largely depending on the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense city centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are at a distance from each other, and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In Finland, the police reported slightly less bike theft in January-August than in the same period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of a little more than 20 000 bike theft annually.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and only in Helsinki about 4 000 bikes a year.
They are in large numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a crime report on bike theft, although less than one in ten cases reported to the police survive.
A typical cleared bike theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught in his blood.
Cases can also be found in connection with other investigations, for example, when stolen bikes can be found in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly by the work itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from, for example, bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars in shopping centres, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja is most stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their own short-term use, for example, but most stolen bikes end up for sale, for example, online.
They remain on the domestic market.
At least the police have not known that stolen bikes would go abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some will probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a hidden crime or violation.
Alarm clocks should ring if a good condition bike is sold at a clear low price," Reen says.
Special librarian Severi Hirvi carries her colourful Nopsa to the shelters of Kallio Library in Helsinki for the duration of her work.
He has had five wheels, but none has been stolen," says the moose. "It has never been taken, it has been a good monk."
Perhaps this may not attract thieves, there may be no hipster value here," says Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who has quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike stumped against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks its bike into something fixed, such as a bike rack.
There is a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, which the frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
All the time you hear from your friends that the bikes have been taken."
Mostly bad bikes, such swarthy Jopas."
A bike was stolen from Valve itself from the housing company’s courtyard a year ago.
However, the bike had not been locked, so Valve could wait for it to be stolen.
Children under the age of 15 are responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki experiments with US-known peer-to-peer whale crews
In Helsinki, so-called peer-to-peer jury is tested to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the trial applies to children under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal responsibility.
The P2P crew is missing the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer jury discusses the incident with the offender and imposes a sanction.
A week later, the offender can join a peer-to-peer crew to make up for their actions.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Affairs, says that the model is not tight.
We have other mediation models that are used side by side.
All guides the young person in a more responsible direction so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model has been introduced for the P2P crew in the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person does not come in front of the adult panel, but reflects on the events with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service design agency Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, says that it was a assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of children under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
It’s been a message to keep on the road of your choice,” says Lovio.
The Peer-to-Peer jury is part of the Helsinki project for immigrant youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to all those in need, not just young people.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a sketch of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, President of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party’s money to be directed to the congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
We believe that the dissensions caused by Donald Trump and his disregard, incompetence, and record unfavorability threaten to bring the voice of democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning the Trump decorative anchor around their neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are reduced day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the prominent Republican against Trump Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect the majority of the Congress" and is not a support for anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump’s actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton Promises Relief for U.S. Children
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton shared the details of his economic policy on Thursday evening.
I wanted to be president so that the US economy would go well for everyone.
Donald Trump strives to be president in order for the economy to go well with his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
Clinton’s plan is centered around a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly through private money.
The construction program is a hand-stretch for American job seekers who suffer after factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in upscale jobs after World War II.
We are a builder nation, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded otherwise from Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it must pay the tax at source, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
[as President] I am against all trade agreements that work against employees or salaries," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton was planning to rate the Republican economic program announced on Monday by Donald Trump that it "comes only such millionaires".
Trump’s proposal for a rebate to corporate taxes Clinton has previously appointed “Trump’s loophole”.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of clothes that Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making himself products in America," Clinton staggered.
These are Rio’s spectator numbers: The races haven’t glued to Finnish squares, but the mobile app is of interest
Normally, sports competitions appear as sharp peaks in TV viewer statistics.
The Olympic Games in Rio have not yet reached a huge number of spectators.
At the same time, the races have glued 12 per cent of the population to the squares: the swimming on the Tuesday evening was followed by 615 000 spectators from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Athletics Championships for one month ago attracted nearly 800 000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over another million.
For the time being, most of the Olympic sports have been interested in Sunday evening cycling and the fifth day opening gymnastics, both of which reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Head of Sport at Yle, is pleased with the viewers’ figures and reminds that the viewers will be distributed at the Rio Olympics for the first time on several different instruments.
In addition to the TV, Finland will also follow the Olympics in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers choose the Olympics in general.
On the TV side, viewers also share with TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions for which Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20 000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a diluted interest - if someone now considers it to be diluted - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the early races, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other interesting sports in Finland: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, viewer numbers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store in the first days of the competition.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150 000 times.
I would bet that we are already going around 200 000 downloads.
We will only get the viewer numbers for the network later", Pokkinen says
The Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and faults have been fixed.
There has been a delay and other technical problems with the use of the Rio Arena in the early stages.
The apps have updated versions that should fix errors.
Rio’s Olympics are seen more widely on Yle’s channels and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be watched from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Speech transmits competitions daily.
The Olympics are perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, as well as the last ones that can only be followed from Yle’s channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports will be visible both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Lake Päijänne, which is 95.3 metres deep in Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square meters in Ristiselkä, the bottom of which was shown to be 104 meters deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried to unnecessarily strengthen the observation by sounding.
The method may not find a small recess in a hundred meters,” says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Lake Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi reach over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
There might well be unknown depths," says Kannela.
If the deepest lake is determined by the medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
As a result, Päijänne cannot reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 14.29: Fixed the last paragraph where the deepest lakes in the middle depth were wrong.
Admirable from the tax depreciation: Taxation of pensioners continues to tighten
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of wage earners.
The admirer says that the maladministration came out under the parliamentary elections, and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal in relation to employees.
This is not included in the proposal of the Board of Directors.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises given should be able to follow after the election, he says to Lännen Media.
At the beginning of this year, the wage earners received deductions that reduced taxation.
The matter was heated up by opposition representatives in Parliament, who charred the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbia (National Coalition Party) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy proposed by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing wages next year.
He says that a tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is satisfied with the message of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Orpo with the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been achieved with great effort.
He says that it is important for credibility to adhere to the agreement..
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It is made by labour market organisations, so it should not be questioned.
It comes in handy because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people’s own future faith.
Seizure of prolonged unemployment in the barn
Ihalainen appeals to the government to seize long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was about 17 000 more than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of increasing the employment rate to 72% is running away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish victims reportedly in Thailand
In Thailand last night and yesterday, at least four people died of bomb attacks in Finland.
The Embassy urges Finland to be familiar with the country and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Very little Finnish in Thailand
According to Westphalia, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled to be at the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bomb attacks.
The Embassy has tried to seek information on the situation of the city especially among Finns in Hua Hin.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalia.
No information about the author
According to Westphalia, there is no information about the perpetrator yet.
The Ambassador thinks that events may be related to the political unrest of the divided Thai society and the recent referendum on the constitutional status of the military junta.
The law was approved in the referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who announced their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict associated with the Muslim population, Westphalian says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, the impacts have not been extended to tourist destinations.
There is a big, local holiday in Bangkok today,” says Westphalen.
According to him, the city celebrates the queen’s birthday and mother’s day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The impact affects the course of the day so that the authorities are very precise about safety.
Thai police: Strikes do not involve international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also ruled out, says the Thai police according to the news agency AP.
During the day, at least four people have died in Thailand, as 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as popular with tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in a tourist destination popular with Finns, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says Thai magazine Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs exploded according to the magazine at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the magazine, one person was wounded.
Popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, on the other hand, has exploded four bombs in total, according to local authorities, yesterday and today.
At least one was killed in both double bomb attacks.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in Surat Thani Village and Trang City.
At least one person died in both strikes.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many travelers as it is used to take you to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Koh Tao Holiday Islands.
Not known as the perpetrator
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, leader of the military junta in Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn’t incite people to panic more,” he said to the journalists.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least Hua Hin and Trang’s shocks are interconnected.
He told Thai BSB that the intention of the creators has been to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist sites.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finland to be familiar with the country and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalian.
In wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the Finnish night.
A bit more information has been available about the attack last night in Hua Hin.
There died a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded there are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin’s second blow.
Two bombs exploded as an attraction near the well-known bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes that it has found another bomb.
The Surat Thani bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the governor of the province.
In the blow, a municipal employee died.
There is at least one wounded.
A police officer interviewed by CNN says that two bombs were also used in Surat Thani’s attack, which exploded every half hour.
According to Bangkok Post, bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won the women's four-way match
Alexandra Raisman from the United States was second to 60.098, and Alija Mustafina from Russia was third to 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for stand-up championships in Rio with perma, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to a large extent in recent years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the championships of the four-match and the floor three times in a row, as well as the boom last and the second year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two world championships in the team.
There are fainter World Championship medals at Biles from the jump and boom.
Thailand’s Finnish entrepreneur: “Strike has no impact on tourism”
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children’s play club in the same property in Phuket, Thailand, has not been worried about the impact of bomb attacks on tourism.
If there are no more impacts, I do not think that this will result in any more miracles, as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia, evaluates the Villa that worked for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many tragedyes that have tested Thailand.
There is always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If even these former have not expelled tourists, it is hardly this either.
The company’s office is located a few hundred meters from the place of explosion.
The villa heard of the blow from its own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said it is not worth coming to the office.
The villa says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed due to shocks in the early morning.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought road closures had been put on account of the queen’s birthday,” Huovila says and refers to Friday holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was peaceful and the shops of the main street were allowed to open at about ten o’clock local time.
On the beach, many had not even heard of the shocks.
Half-three days in Thailand, Patong had normalized traffic and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the impact, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who has visited the impact site.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was lit.
The scout found two men who were fit for the tactile signs hidden in the nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other went away, but the man was later found in the forest with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of using a motor vehicle for theft, theft and gross damage.
The police would like to thank those who gave tips.
Director of Research on Russia’s leadership changes: Clear shifting aside
On Friday, Russia underwent the highest-ranking change in leadership for years when President Vladimir Putin separated Sergei Ivanov, head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, an Estonian-born 44-year-old.
He is an ex-diplomate and is the secondman of Ivanovi.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from gaining too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of leadership is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from gaining independence from the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been subjected to friction with other executives or screwed up.
Drive drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s insider, will move on to special environmental and transport tasks.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the change was a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to other positions and proposed that Vaino be replaced,” said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very important in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the President’s Security Council.
During the Soviet era, Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old curve, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov’s place is that Putin changes his immediate circle to be younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn’t aim for them,” said Sherfan Darwin, representative of the Manbiji Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were exported to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took possession of about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to the Isis.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Fixed the previous news at 19:30: In the past, we misrepresented that civilians were fleeing from the city, really the Isis fighters captured civilians as they fled from the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document publication policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on the publicity of documents is illegal,” says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority’s own guidelines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanomat for the Minister of the Interior’s events.
The Minister justified the decision with the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry’s Communications Department says to STT that the Ministry has identified a need to renew its practices.
Usain Bolt’s last Olympic show starts in Rio
Like in recent years, Bolt has run against time under the ranks.
He insulted his backs at the beginning of the season and had to skip Jamaican Olympic competitions.
This has not been a complete preparation, but I am in much better condition.
I have practiced well and it is a key issue, Bolt said in his press conference in Rio.
This press conference included low-clothed samba dancers and journalists who have turned into fans.
Around Porina Bolt, it underlines that the Jamaican star has risen in the era of athletics struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens 2004, when he qualified for 200m in early stages during 21.05.
Back then, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, crushing the world record and the competition’s self-confidence in spite of the final celebrations of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later at the Berlin World Championships, Bolt reached his career with a legal point at the clock.
The world records of 9.58 metres and 19.19 two hundred are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds below, but no one believes that it will be born except Bolt himself.
At Satasella, Bolt’s challenger is Justin Gatlin, the Olympic champion of the 2004 century in Athens.
Last year, at the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost in the finals of the prestigious races if only he has been on his way.
In Daegu in 2011, the World Cup final of 100 was not running from Bolt due to misconduct.
Bolt turns over after a week 30.
He is an old man in the sport of young men, and the Rio races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has placed the next year’s World Cup in London as the last finish line of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from others.
I am older and this is more difficult.
But whenever I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to China’s state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
There were traces of prohibited substances in the doping sample of the Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with indications of the epoch hormone.
He finished fourth in Rio in the 100-metre women’s butterfly.
According to the Brazilian magazine Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Sports Petitions Court CAS.
Xinhua says that a specimen given by Xinyi on Sunday could have been found in a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female fluid runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with indications of the epoch hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has passported Rio as a athletic coach home due to doping.
The International Olympic Committee (KOK) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had completed the test as an athlete and had given a doping sample on behalf of him.
According to media data, it is a Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich race pass.
Phelps doesn't stop anything - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps from the United States swims in a 200-metre mixed swim in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same sport of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps’ win time was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was placed second in a mixed swim before the Chinese Wang Shun.
I’m just trying to have a little fun, BBC’s Olympic swim commentator Helen Skelton laughs at Iltalehti’s quick interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on this week’s Iltalehti website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not stress much if there is a slight noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
There is visual media, he emphasises.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress with at least enough revealability - for the eyes of at least many conservative British spectators.
However, there are no rear steps.
It’s important to look good, and the little ghastly are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to tint and perhaps startle, but he emphasizes that he doesn’t want to play the main role.
This is not about me," he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It should not matter so terribly how I dress.
Can you imagine that the stir has reached Finland?
I can’t, but everything that pays attention to how these swimmers are doing things hard and how big a sacrifice they are making is ok for me, Skelton grinnes.
Do you know what?
It is a stir from scratch if it comes from the dress (the presenter).
I am a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests due to suspicion of terrorism
The Rio police announced on Thursday that it has arrested two people due to suspicion of terrorism.
The police carried out arrests in connection with the safety control of the competitions.
The police carried out five other arrests at the same time and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, people arrested due to terrorism belong to the same group, whose members were arrested by the police already in July.
Detained persons are believed to have links with the ISIS extremist organization.
The arrested had reportedly incited violence in social media.
Messages about violence had been distributed, among other things, in the popular WhatsApp service.
85 000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.

Argentine dame burst out of Petäjä-Siren - Finnish ponder protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren experienced hard on Thursday.
The Argentine dame packed Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening start of the women’s surfing day.
Winds were broken clearly.
The opponent granted the violation.
He was stuck because of a crash, and the others ran away," said Joakim Wilenius, head coach of Finland.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It wasn’t worth doing because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped into the water to get a refund, Petäjä-Siren said.
Finnish hanged on his board until the last because he didn’t want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
With the crash, Finland was ranked 27th.
In the overall situation, the London Olympic silver medalist of 2012 is the eighth.
In terms of tip, the crash didn’t have much impact.
On Friday, it’s an important day when you race to leave 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first data, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that according to science prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring extra years into a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person cannot influence can bring him/her extra years.
These include tendencies in middle body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your age.
You don’t always have to work out – just picking up a milk can is enough.
The secret of a long age has been studied in many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
Harvard University research found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death", especially with neurological or cardiac diseases.
Alcohol, on the other hand, is the cause of studies, according to which moderate use - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of floss can extend a person’s life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway examined how laughing affected a person’s life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were more concise people 35% more likely to live after the experiment ended.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition to everything, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years of life, he or she should also have an orgasm.
Of course, exercise will bring extra years, it will not be disputed.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute shortness.
One study from the University of Oxford found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
There were also more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it’s an athlete who has won medalists at the Olympics or an actor who won Oscar, he is more likely to live beyond the usual bun.
Many research has tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring to his life for extra years.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that a long age is due to a person’s social status – which, on the other hand, enables, for example, the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study on shopping behaviour in people over the age of 65 found that a person who shopped every day was probably less likely to be the parent of a person who shopped.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring about death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping therefore does not have the same effect.
Intoxicated drunk driving fell into the truck
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car frontal collision took place in Koskela, Southwest Finland.
An accident occurred in Koskela, mid-koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left in its lane, but it was lit up.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car fell into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
The woman, who transported a passenger car in 1972, was left in the car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the women’s blow test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Posti sends loose candies to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket’s selection of loose candy was lacking because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candies from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulk confectionery, because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We get more when Posti gets delivered the load!
So, if there is no congestion with lawn mowing, the sign read.
The retailer’s foxing sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include grass cutting as well.
Lawnmowers are available at Posti until the end of August.
According to Haltia, the sign was mostly amusing and he decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update struck me a little bit.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia’s update had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites to grab in a loose candy bag, even though a few of the glasses were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of Posti’s Corporate Transport, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five pallets went to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) yesterday and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloo) to three, but today we only took five pallets, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
Ilta-Sanomat first reported on the matter.
Teija Haltia was not indignant with the sign because she found all her favorite loose candy in the selection.

Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his weight loss contract already in 2009.
He is a comprehensive lifestyle change and has gradually lost thirty kilograms.
On Friday, Backlund published a picture pair on Instagram.
The picture shows how huge Lotta has changed over the years in terms of appearance.
The photo pair of Backlund before and after has collected several thankful comments from fellow slimmers.
You are wonderful.
We are on the same journey, motivation hard! one anneals.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's do it now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when the sky itself is on the same journey, the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilograms with the Let's do it now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to get to a normal weight, which was then ten kilos.
During the three-month course of fitness, five kilograms eventually fell.
The wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the 42-year-old family of a woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered for the police dog work instead of flowers and adresses.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoon Eläinlääkäriasema and also completed their nursing training there.
The vet clinic remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous and unafraid of work.
Good Friend.
Still, we can’t fully realize that he’s gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to the police dogs in full, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Loviisa’s Koskenkylä.
A woman’s neighbors have said that the victim to Iltalehti was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old suspected of murder did not know a woman, nor did they have any connection with each other.
The police dog Börje was involved in the murderer’s follow-up, which was wounded life-threateningly in a detention situation.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court gave Posti a ruling on an infringement of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to withhold the wages of an employee who refused to introduce the leased employee, assesses the district court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay most of the retained salary to the employee and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the instructor’s salary, which corresponded to the part of the orientation of the entire day’s work.
According to the District Court, an employee was placed in a disadvantaged position on the basis of their trade union activities in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the Union of Postal and Logistics PAU’s organisational decision on the prohibition of induction.
During the November letterbox last year, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees will not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who violate the strike.
First, the People’s News reported.
Turkey’s return to a path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and respect for human rights development, write to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in his response to the Finnish Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his earlier letter, the Finnish Association of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns for freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and expression to Turkey.
Putin separated the manager of his administration - replaced by an Estonian-born Persecution
President of Russia Vladimir Putin has separated Sergei Ivanov, Head of Presidential Administration, says Kreml.
The place will be replaced by the grandson of Soviet-Estonian communist leader Karl Vaino Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Vice President since 2012.
Persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says the news agency Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
According to the bulletin of the Kremlin, Ivanov, a member of Putin’s close insider, moves on to special environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed Vaino to replace him,” says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in the espionage of the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President of Putin in 2012 before his re-election.
BBC: ManU giant ban - not seen in the Premier League opening
The world record player for soccer moves will not be seen in the field when the Premier League kicks off in the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed with England.
Manchester United’s giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the side as ManU opens its league season on Sunday against Bournemouth,” said BBC on Friday.
ManU paid EUR 105 million for Pogba to Juventus, according to the British media.
However, the English football association FA keeps him away from the game, as he was banned from Juventus.
He received two warnings in the last season's Italian Cup, and it becomes a single-match ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pogba’s next seam to play is the league’s second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, madness is virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival’s position as an internationally acclaimed event starred by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial turf and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just be the main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The result of success is a simple question: What kind of event would the creators themselves want to go to?
It is quite different in event productions that we think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow will sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors of 70 000 last year by 5 000 people.
This year, a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists will be seen at the festival.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because activities must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled in huge fairways.
We don’t want it.
Over the course of 13 years, the idea of a successful event has been inflated so that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area decorated partly with artificial turf.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year the venue will be a tent for 15 000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I’m a bit mad, but at the same time we’ve been able to preserve Flow’s spirit.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done on the rock is that even today big visions are practically possible.
In the early 2000s, the operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of approximately EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was about EUR 6 million.
It can also be used to create "crisis things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
However, fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge group of fans in his genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was being booked because now is probably the last time he is seen on a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what is played on a commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he has done damn good gigs in recent years.
Thailand tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists escaped in terror
On a Thursday night, two bombs exploded in Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died in the blow and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blasted with mobile phones.
The bombs were located on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, said police representative Samoer Yoosumran according to CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector who lived in Asia, tweeted a much-speaking image of the attacks.
If the TV is not displayed properly, you can see it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The crowds ran against me and said that the bomb has exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning local time exploded two bombs in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which is also popular with Finns.
No one is known to die.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was made in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang City.
The police reported that they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bomb attacks that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently tapped into the activities of criminal organisations engaged in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new armed forces leaves for wartime first
In the event of an acute war, conscripts are ordered to fight only after several months of the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to the Chief of Education of the Finnish Defence Forces interviewed by the magazine, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, for example, those who serve for 5.5 months in a military situation are only able to fight at the end of their training.
According to the Head of Education, reservists are first assigned to the service.
No conscripts or reservists are ordered to complete a task that has not been trained, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training conscripts in the units of immediate readiness from next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola got giant reparations from a mold house
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a tough dispute about the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After the transaction, however, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused harmful microbes to be present to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in dismantling condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction there from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both district and court court.
The Court of Appeal delivered a judgment in the case on Wednesday.
It held a judgment in the district court in which the seller was ordered to pay a price reduction of EUR 150 000 to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller must pay the couple’s legal expenses and liquidation expenses in a total of EUR 47 344.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because some need to repair the apartment had already been known to buyers when the apartment was being sold.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the errors in construction were significantly more serious than had been presented.
Tola is looking for a home in good condition
Tola told at the Court of Appeal that the couple had been looking for a home in good condition, because they did not want to take up repair work.
He had realized that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the factors mentioned in the condition check report were not harmful.
The condition inspection report was mentioned as risks and shortcomings in ventilation, and the fact that the management of rainwater and melting water flowing along the rock surface is not sufficient.
However, the discussions did not reveal that it would have been a matter of any kind.
Tola and Waroma came to the idea that rainwater from the rock should be controlled a little over a few years.
Shops were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
In the inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013, microbes were found, which, according to the evidence, were caused by both the rainwaters of the rock and the soil moisture that has risen in capillaries.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector, also enter the interior through the porch.
A sample of mould or yeast that crosses the limits of health risk was found in the utility room, the basement staircase, the window bay in the living room and the basement washroom.
Terraces built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision prior to the sale, according to which changes had been made to the apartment in violation of the permit.
Among other things, the terraces were built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as it was and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no special reason to carry out a larger inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their accountability, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children in Nazis - in the register also Finnish
Editor Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article of Dagens Nyheter how the National Archives in Maryland, USA has recorded a total of 218 500 women on microfilms, who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also US, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted Nazi brides.
The documents and register cards originate from the Nazi-Germany breed agency.
The breed agency was head of SS Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same applied to even greater numbers of women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women underwent gynecological examinations to investigate the matter.
The Finnish Heritage Agency examined women’s backgrounds, for example, by studying church books.
The aim was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women’s family tree.
Women also had to be willing to give up their Swedish nationality and give the breed agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The breed agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving", "savvy", and "good national socialists" who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS male brides.
The article does not explain how 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-backed program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not actively promoted, the U.S. Holocaust Museum website explains.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and support for the acquisition of children.
The honorary cross of the German mother was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum website states.
Petäjä-Sire's sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first race of Finnjoll’s day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained as a group of tails at the second race of the day.
In total, Nikko rose to eighth place after five leaves, but the failure of the second left dropped him to 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in the RS:X-class day start positions 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were numbered 23 at the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded for a couple of hours with a night’s sleep: “I was so in the cake”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship barman to the tango king of 1995, to the best-selling solo artist in Finland and star of the dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää is still struggling and he is currently on a wild rise.
A book by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - "Paljana" was published today on Thursday.
In Sillanpää, Sillanpää talks about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää’s career rose to a total ascent when he won the tango king’s crown on the Tango Market in Seinäjoki in 1995.
Sillanpää sang tangos in the competition, but he had already planned a bit of different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a piece of tango for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finland’s music history.
In the book, however, the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had had a party in the evening.
I was so in the can!
Sillanpää remembers the book.
It would not be immediately understood from the recording of a huge hit that it was sung in a hangover.
Although I was not physically at my best, the mark was still good.
I learned that there is no need to demand the perfect and the top of it all the time.
Another accident related to the most popular songs of a man, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time and the case finally ended up in the texts of the song You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book states that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmänen were not as Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells the real story of his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true, but based on the news of 7 days.
In the news of the magazine, Jari’s and ex-favorite resignation was due to his excessive partying and alcohol use, but according to Jari, it was a full bunny and did not keep it true.
According to the book, Jari played in a furious record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good so.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of the voters voted in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polling week’s opinions predict the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in terms of staying in the EU.
None of the prestigious research institutes or universities flags the difference, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the slogan "It's the economy, stupid" of the recent election campaign of former US President Bill Clinton flew the scrap guide in the British Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Financial curl language
In its latest monthly survey, Centre for Macroeconomics provides answers to Brexit disasters.
The most typical answer is that no economists were listened to because this time the voters made a decision on non-financial grounds.
One explanation for economic loss is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it is out of the right British.
Many also have the idea that a decrease in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the unanimity of the economists did not come up enough.
In particular, they were denied the equality of the BBC, which gave as much space as two per cent of the EU’s economics representatives from the economists as to the overwhelming majority.
IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE are not interested in the EU-minded press, and other economic combinations of power as to the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened and understood, they were not conveyed, because the economists represent an elite with which the voters feel that they do not share common interests.
The academics of cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The ultimate profit argument for the Brexit vote concerned immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will congested your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments tricked.
There are foreign employees in each café.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre you can see immigrants.
How much easier would the British get doctor’s appointments if they were not?
Every school has children from immigrants.
How much easier would the children of the right British get to school if they were to get rid of?
Foreigners live in each municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they disappeared?
I think these are economic questions.
They apply to jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists did not succeed in responding to them and, if successful, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer queues for health centres, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants – and especially EU immigrants – are the net payers of the British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepared for Brexit for Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up the A and B plans.
Plan B, or the victory of a camp that pays out the difference in the EU, began to be prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in case the result would be leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We started to increase our cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen, the only open-ended real estate fund in Aberdeen that the news related to on a daily basis.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The fund was worth £3.5 billion at the time.
In total, the value of the company’s funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen from all the open real estate funds of the British real estate funds.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained ten per cent or even below it.
Thus, real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the camp to win the EU withdrawal won, Europe got confused.
However, the two weeks following the voting in the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of Mark Carney, Director General of the Bank of England, in which he estimates that Brexit could pose a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trading.
Together, they blinked and put the matter in the main headings of Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and after the fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen’s situation was good due to the cash raised, but it also had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trading, but changed pricing down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether money should now be withdrawn in panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it wouldn’t be worth it because it would cause losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of the reports were cancelled.
Since then, the market has been quite steady, and now the market has been very peaceful for a couple of weeks,” says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen’s mainland European funds.
However, there were a lot of surveys.
Unreasonably attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate funds received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open-ended funds affected by closures account for about four per cent of the UK real estate.
Aberdeen’s lockdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 of its properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
This week, Aviva Investors warned its investors that it might hold on to its fund for 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been pushed down, but the situation does not seem to be more "crazy" for Aberdeen.
The biggest issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors,” Vanhanen points out.
The price of pounds and dollars is at its lowest for 30 years, in addition to which there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought minuses to the London real estate market
For two in the morning, the situation did not look very strange yet.
But from four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, re-awakened to see the outcome of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
A word of power came in.
I realized that this is going to Plan B now,” says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed to work at once.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the morning.
The TV screens, which were normally silent in the office, supported the news, and usually the loud crowds were completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to tell about his difference.
When the market opened, the display terminals blinked only red.
It was such a morning that you would never have thought you would live,” says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions on Midsummer after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had prepared for the option well, and therefore the situation was kind of peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote started repair shop
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, the British management went for an exchange.
Strong declines were anticipated in the UK and especially in the London real estate market.
In the coming years, up to 20 per cent of the minuses were anticipated in London’s offices.
Soon, a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty continues to roar in the air.
However, it does not appear to have spent its last summer holidays in Helsinki this week on the face of Vanhanen.
He thinks it’s too early to say a lot about what’s going on with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the London real estate market has already been obtained.
The real estate service company CBRE’s information on price development covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the office buildings of City of London, 6.1 per cent of me accumulated, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not that terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equally large drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
According to Vanhanen, the parable is not quite relevant, as it is now a home-made crisis in the UK.
The atmosphere is different too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity,” says Vanhanen.
You can find financing as usual.
The repair shop could have been ahead anyway
In fact, the price correction movement is no wonder about him - it could have been ahead without Brexit as well.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of real estate in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have said for two years that City and especially offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have been on the rise for four reasons, Vanhanen’s list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is being globalized,” Vanhanen says.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
As a well-known city, London is an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which has led to pension companies seeking returns on new projects, for example.
The loan has been easily available on top of this – although the leverage has been used clearly less than during the 2008 crisis boom, according to Vanhanen.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, prices stabilised last summer,” says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also started to lighten its holdings in London, and last year it was a net seller.
There was a sort of turn to wait, and now it came.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops,” says Vanhanen.
Not much he dares to estimate the future, but he says that there is hardly any spike to rise.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a descending or even going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And still he is an optimistic who believes that the pits will be cleared by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global diversification.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of its victim.
If you have diversified, the risks are also decentralised, says Vanhanen.
S Group starts to register purchase information more accurately than before
The S Group knows what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it was starting to collect even more detailed information about the purchases of its loyal customers.
So far, when the information has been collected on the final receipt, the group will start to pick it up at the beginning of May also from the purchased products.
The S Group comes after Kesko, as the data on goods purchased with a Plus Card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and is used with permission for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Quite a few customers have prohibited the use of product information, says Riitala to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group’s registration change.
According to food purchases alone, Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing for the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and this is not planned.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty programme, which can be joined in Valintatalos, Siwa and Euromarket.
We do not currently collect product- or category-level information, we keep a record of the final amount of the receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day and the final amount of the customer’s receipt.
We haven’t gone to that level as K Group or S Group,” says Anu Ora, Commercial Director.
According to him, the aim is to renew the loyalty programme in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell you later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially a trial
SOK’s customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address information, basic information has also included occupation, education, form of residence, years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their role have also been registered.
The purchase date and time, place, total amount of purchases and payment method have been saved from the S-Etukortti purchase.
In addition, S bonus partners’ information has been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, in S-markets, Prisma, Kodin Terro and ABC-chains, the data is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of SOK’s Customer Ownership and Partner Operations.
S Group says it informs its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the information is stored at checkouts in any case, whether or not you want it.
Anyone can check their stored data on the S Group’s website.
For example, the funds cannot access the data, emphasises Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is the newest dog confirmation from Customs - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black laborator’s puppy is keenly sniffing five boxes in the same row at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing it with its favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of powder gas-smelling sockets was uncovered.
Powder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce access
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also be taken to other border crossing points and ports if necessary by Heila and Suntio.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The impact of Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs and, after the impact, supervision has been confirmed, says Mikko Grönberg, Senior Inspector at Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun dog and explosive dog in Customs’ duties is postal consignments through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal consignments run through the airport each year, including military equipment and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made a search for approximately 300 weapons, weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their source materials, from online shopping, passenger aircraft and air freight at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It must be checked for checked baggage and postal items.
In the future, ports will have a big benefit when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs assesses whether additional weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg hopes to think.
School in Kirkkonummi
The Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also attends training with Heila at the police and experts of the Finnish Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Finnish Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides which odors Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are six drug dogs from Finnish Customs, as well as cash and drug dogs Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog at the airport include a whirlwind and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at home in Suntio, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila can be reached at home, Suntio laughs.
Discreet orders go to Heila from a lump sum.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the microphone cover of the camera for a quick dog, but Heila returns the protective cover that looks like a soft toy right away from the "disconnect" command.
Tough competition from working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, in which the training is assessed as sufficient for demanding work tasks.
Heila can be seen in work at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers can’t come and pet the dog on top of the work vest,” says Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is about 60000-70000 euros per year for Customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they will retire to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work parts only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a fierce competition at Customs as the owner of working dogs.
Approximately 20-30 of Customs’ employees applied for Heila as the owner.
Onni hit Suntio, who has not had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and supervision tasks at Customs.
Mini-state got its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
In the country, less than one million residents of Fiji’s Olympic gold in rugby are valued so high that the government has designated the 22nd of August as a national holiday.
According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company, the Fijian government confirmed this after the championship was decided.
The day off is held the day after the team returns home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fiji Rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected for the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, I heard them encourage,” said Maikele Seru to Guardian, editor of Fiji Times.
Drama in Rio - The Finnish Buyer Swirled After Wild Performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilograms after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a raiser.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one has been able to say why.
Tokola received 175 kilograms of push in Rio and 145 kilograms in the event.
His combined result was 320 kg.
Tokola tried to get his push at the latest 175 kilograms, as well as each other.
At the third company, the weights rose accompanied by a wild roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires an attacker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, who plays in the men’s football league, has signed a season-end official striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player for our team with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
With more than ten player-agents, we went through plenty of 50 players from all over the world.
Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, started to stand out from the crowd.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinn, where she scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi residents meet the master of Finland SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Voluptuous Modern Family star shrugs again: teenage star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become familiar with the modern family comedy series as Alex Dunphyna, returns to show off her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don’t leave much to imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the legs of the actress, but also the back.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing its style and behavior considerably bolder.
The star has posed in their social media images in very little clothing and took numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several photos of herself celebrating.
If the image does not appear, you can view it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter has a "typical Hollywood makeover" running from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and has grown in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention Hollywood gets, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actress has been indignant with some of her long-term fans with her image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years, when the downhill is already about hard, says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some female fans, on the other hand, are defending the actor and urging not to care about criticism.
You look great!
Exactly the same thing that others say.
You are inspired by many women, glowing a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the northern lights: In the autumn, it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start their northern lights travel already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations for northern lights tourism in Japan are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a good demand for winter northern lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and continues well into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the sight twice as fairy-tale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, for example.
According to a study conducted by researchers at Aalto University and the University of Turku and the University of Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sights from Finland, and this northern lights has huge potential according to Lind.
In Finland, overnight stays by Japanese tourists have increased significantly more than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed more than twice as much in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest as a target group for tourism in Finland, as they used more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain was forced to settle for silver at rugby-7 when the Fiji champion team won gold
The UK’s impressive success in the seven-player rugby race was broken down as Fiji won it in the finals of the Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday 43–7.
Fiji taught the masters in ball handling, moves, side delusions, support games, running lines, and brutally, winning gold – if it was the first Olympic medal in its history for the country.
The loss marked silver, which was a bit leaner comfort for Britain, as it was the third silver in the country on the same day, and they can be proud of their success as the Olympic sport in the first rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the 7–5 semi-finals, the tight win from the South African Boksi had a negative impact on the team in the finals on the same day.
Despite this, the Fijian team would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full force.
The fact that at least one British would receive a gold medal to the UK tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, a former rugby-7 team coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been quite for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost in Ryan’s coaching all the games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Loss hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji started excellently and presented his tackle skills to the UK as if for fun.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams had come across a group of moving buses, and the world champions rose to the top 5–0 as Osea Kolinisau made a crash at the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
The situation between 12 and 0, and the UK had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning tackling prevented the powerful Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it did not slow down Fiji's course for a long time.
After seven minutes of playing the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal in the right corner, after which the UK was 17–0 defeated.
Nakarawa scored the second goal for a further start, leaving the first half of the game more than a minute left.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou rushed through the even more powerless tackles of the UK team and rushed over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended between 29 and 0.
It seemed like the Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the sport as an apprentice.
What is so true.
The UK made extensive changes in half-time and managed to hold back the Fijians for four minutes, which compared to the first half was a good performance until Joshua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the excellent team play of the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow down by 36–7 making a goal for the UK to the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea archipelago residents whose fans in the auditorium sang, swayed the flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the pure joy of Fiji.
Mata Viliame made the finishing touches to the Fijian cake by scoring in the final moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell into the field, perfectly crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won the Japanese semi-finals by 20–5, and the UK had honed past South Africa in a tight semi-final where the tie was solved by the UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goal posts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of English 15 rugby team player Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach’s battle against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
This could not be more emotional than gold in these races.
From the first print, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed with 220 victorious strokes in history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the oars were two, the boat echoed the voice of third coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to play their second Olympic gold in the women’s pair, making them the first women in the history of British sports to reach a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, the victory was already the 39th consecutive and once again record.
What we see, two great athletes attaching water like swans on an age, does not fully correspond to the nature of success.
Behind each rowing gold is a large number of helping hands, each of which has taken the two towards achievements, however, the most important of the assistants is the coach, who was diagnosed 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see this day.
According to Williams, the situation was tight at the time.
I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery it would have spread everywhere
and the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes a bit of a way of thinking."
Williams received a diagnosis in December 2013.
The trio was lucky enough to be able to start their treatment outside the season of the sport at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if now in such circumstances one can even say.
I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps are enough.
That’s where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the duo's thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and talked a little more than normal in trying to overcome their own unrest.
The captain of the British Royal Artillery Regiment Stanning, who was behind him on the tour of Afghanistan, says: "I have been at emotional level this week as ruins, which may be a bit extreme, but that means so much."
It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we have worked together with Helen and Robin.
The last three years Helen and Robin’s cashier have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t have anything, so an insanely big thank you to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better person to train with, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition for the past five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm for which their competitors have failed to compare.
Even on the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish duos began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
We were very caught in an instant.
Helen said, "Stay with you, stay with you."
It is very important not to get off the route."
We managed to leave well, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything wonderful.
We didn't reach for the skies today, we just wanted to make a good rowing and win the race we did."
The duo thinks about the year before deciding on their future.
Glover celebrates next month’s wedding with Steve Backshall, familiar from TV’s nature shows
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
After London it took about six months before I realized that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland changes the government of Panama leaks
In October, Iceland will hold an early parliamentary election that will be demanded by protesters enraged by Panama data leaks already in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for demonstrators.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johansson promised to hold a new election in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the nation’s last-year fury will affect the election result in the autumn.
In June, the criticality of the presidential elections was clearly visible, and Gudni Johansson, who was nominated outside politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama to be the founder of Isis
Donald Trump, President of the U.S. Republicans, cancelled his latest speeches.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of terrorist organization Isis and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be involved in the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic Party became enraged at speeches and demanded for forgiveness from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to fall down to command the army, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the Muslim-popular burkin bathing suit on beaches, says, among other things, the British magazine Guardian.
A decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear that greatly express religious links can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove the French national day to the celebrated crowd.
At the end of July, two men connected to the ISIS attacked the Church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - cyanobacteria in Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only cyanobacteria have been observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Office took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public beaches.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the limits laid down in the Decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The water levels of E.coli and entercoccus in Meriniemi beach were ensured on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the limits of the measures.
The cyanobacteria observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unsuitable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into cyanobacterial bloom, creating blue-green algae mass in ferries.
The environmental policy monitors the situation through increased inspections.
If the cyanobacterial sedimentation turns into cyanobacterial bloom, this is also communicated separately on the beach notice board.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK Hakkarainen on forest gift deduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the budget proposal for next year of the Ministry of Finance.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction that would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change in forest premises.
The proposal by the Ministry of Finance has four objectives: to promote the generational changes of forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea that such a tool will be made to promote the generational changes in forest farms is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds something to criticize in the proposal for a tax change.
A forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner’s pure capital income.
It is capital income, from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The proposal by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health starts with the deduction of the purely capital income from forestry, which would result in the loss of the capital income from forestry, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive tax benefit even if no wood was sold.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner cannot perceive it, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, according to him, the model applies only to a small part of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the income value of the forest is EUR 40 000.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, he says that it cuts 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owner base, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the space.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reductions have been taken away for decades in forest policy.
It is based on the aging of the forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Strong hailstorm surprised motorists in Himanka - two cars fell into a ditch and collided with each other
In Kalajoki, Himanka, a special rear-wheeling happened on Friday morning.
According to the rescue department, two cars that drove in a row fell into the ditch, after which they came behind them.
According to Harri Pyyhtiä, the on-call firefighter, the derailment of the ditch is suspected of being caused by a severe hail.
The car behind had two people, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more detailed information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that was driving above did not hurt.
The accident happened on highway 8 from Himanka towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments even more efficiently.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of the cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to correspond to normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer drug treatments may be improved by focusing not only on cancer cells but also on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
Research results have been published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
The threshing of Muhos family home death continues at the court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another factor
The threshing of the family home of Muhos continues at the court for both of the sentenced.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for family home killing in Muhos.
The second received 8 years of 4 months of, among other things, the kill and aggravated robbery made as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The sentenced person also received a judgment on aggravated risk of traffic safety as a young person and the right to transport the vehicle as a young person.
The judge of the District Court was appealed by the prosecutor, the attorneys-at-law and the man who received the stricter judgment.
The prosecutor demands that a less severe sentenced man be sentenced for a 12 year imprisonment as a young person.
Are at the moment of action in full understanding
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young people killed a man who worked as the supervisor of the Child Welfare Unit of the school home in July last year.
According to the judgment, the 17-year-old was attacked by a director sitting on the sofa in the living room from behind.
The instructor had got out of the grip and led the young man to his room, where one of the young men struck him with a vacuum pipe.
Among other things, the instructor was strangled, beaten and kicked to the head.
According to the state of mind study, both sentenced were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to law, young people had planned to escape from a family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lasting vertebrate in the world, increases only at the age of 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed as an ice shark, says a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, i.e. the sleeve can live up to 400 years old.
The female only increases at the age of 156.
The lifespan of the ice shark is increased by the fact that it only grows in a centenary year.
Only one species of mussels are known to live longer than ice sharks.
Researchers found their age with radiocarbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the researchers were able to assess the age of the sharks.
The oldest age was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need a different world.
Even a third of all tax revenues in the state would not be received if the change that Donald Trump has driven to corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, due to tax reliefs that benefit the richest ones.
Trump described his tax program revolutionary while presenting it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
A really huge amount would not be collected, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after the reduction proposed by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be transferred completely.
Trump blamed the state for too much regulation in the business sector and for driving small businesses to bankruptcy.
The decided environmental standards of the emergency must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector must be lifted.
The health care reform of Barack Obama must be taken for a new treatment.
The administration shall appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "destroying" trade policy is one of the main causes of US problems.
Free trade agreements would be withdrawn.
A 45 per cent penalty tax would be levied on imports from China and a 35 per cent penalty tax would be levied on imports from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanity, not globality, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need another world:
American cars will drive in the streets, American planes connect cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists – including those close to Republicans – see Trump’s program taking the United States into a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton announced his own programme early Friday in Finland.
A wave of energy from the past - People's News
The sea is ruining fatefully, but the actual storm strikes in the middle of Madrid’s street bustle – accounting with the past can begin.
It summarises the essence of Pedro Almodóvar’s novelty story.
Almodovar’s previous guidance The Travel Lovers (2013) was a little funny and russia-side satirical comedy, the precursor of the Skin in which I live (2011) the career of a Spanish winger.
Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere between the two works.
It is a serene love, relationship and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is seen as a long back.
Life seems to be on its model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a backdrop and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before the birth of his daughter, from the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta’s Adraina Ugarte, who plays as a young teacher, will appear in the second female main part of the series Sew-on (2013-2014).
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a cleavage, but I myself would say that quite cunningly and literally with a single swipe.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance from Julieta to such a distinctive bursting sensation.
It is an equally well-proclaimed, understated, place with good music and a rather sad film with elements of elegance as it is.
Instead, the typical visual saturation of the Spanish instructor is retained and so that it starts to slowly intimidate more as a pure form than as a functional dramatic effect.
People in the film are tested by diseases, deaths or just sudden losses, but the surface remains as Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name person, the outfit changes from scene to scene, and the same applies to spectacular ears.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the tunings of the respective scene, is not improved in particular.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript on the basis of three short stories by the award-winning Canadian Alice Munro in Nobel.
Novellit is published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly equitable literary filming.
There would have been a lot of material for even more dramatic drama, so much big things - especially the grubbing guilt - the thematics of the film are discussed.
Directed and screenplay by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
Government tries election gigs - People's News
No new cuts will be made, quirky ministers, so that the Finns Party would not collapse completely.
However, surgeries decided on in the spring will be carried out in a lot of stores.
There will be no new surgeries.
The already decided savings of four billion are sufficient.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) say.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM’s presentation, because the decisions on social security cuts were already made in the spring frame.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training surgeries continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why do ministers emphasize so drastically that no new cuts are made on top of them?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not gallups.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal election result, which takes the different directions of the government parties, will ruin the atmosphere of the government for a long time.
The Gallups report, however, that the government party to the Finns Party expects a brawling loss, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new delegates, most of which next spring will see a realisation of the price of influencing the right-wing government.
The life thread of the government of about three equal parties is dependent on the resistance of the Finns Party to endure.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters received enough government policy already during the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s fermentation have also come to the surface.
First of all, new cuts will be blurred by the fact that next year they will be carried out drastically and secondly, trying to soften the attack that awaits the Finns Party.
Large surgeries in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set the target of indebtedness during this election period, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take a debt of EUR 5.9 billion next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the Board of Directors has two options.
The first is to raise your hands early in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: indebtedness is not likely or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
It means even harder new cuts on top of the former in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be ruined at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring, what will happen will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
Indebtedness by these measures is not likely to occur
It is completely clear that the current measures do not bend the debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to instill a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the press conference on the budget prove it unrecognised:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, which means that there will be no appeal to the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008 except during the recovery policy that was carried out temporarily in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this decade and prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros per year more than in 2008.
In the curves presented by Hetemäki, public debt exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about six billion euros, which is practically covered by taking a whole new debt.
This is the view of the city centre, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Survey: Municipalities want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four thinks that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity for children is the responsibility of the municipality.
A clear majority of the population also rolls the responsibility for libraries, culture, adult education centres, construction supervision, general upper secondary education and waste management to an individual municipality.
Regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education and training, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities are the most clearly wanted to be responsible for the region.
None of the tasks under municipal responsibility are to be transferred to the state.
A underage drunkard ran after the chase police run away
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsitie on Friday night at half a time.
The police patrol tried to stop without a motorbike driven by lights, but the young man started driving the police away at a fair speed.
The pursuit continued to Sonkajanrantantie, from where it continued to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the quicker cop ran away.
The blowing test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver’s license that would have justified driving a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, among other things, as aggravated endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch
A truck in Kivilasti fell into a trench on Kaavintie at 21.15.
The truck had drifted out of the road in the bend to the left and fell on its side into the trench.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver away from the crashed truck through the leftover door together with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the owner of the car.
A fallen truck spilled on the road hydraulic oil, which the rescue department absorbed into the peat.
The police investigate the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon on the Ilmajoki River
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki, Lahtinkylä, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for about 165 centimetres long, slender and well-groomed women with white hair under the chin.
Observations and tips on the movements of a lost person are requested to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre’s tip number 029544053.
The material of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery about the destruction of Parafesti
The flooding of the tents of the Parafestival caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chair of the Parafesto Association of Joensuu, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performance of Parafesti, Kalle Salonen, was performed at the end of Friday evening on the market stage.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances held at the City Theatre from 13 a.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized as planned.
The flow rate is created in the lightning cloud when rainwater and its weight start the falling air flow.
The changes in the state of thunder cloud water bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
It is reported from the Finnish Meteorological Institute that several surge currents occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of downstreams is difficult to predict.
The rush flow hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum in Parafesti on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents crashed, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the event of an accident, four persons were slightly injured.
There was one child in the group who was transported slightly injured to further care.
Air pollution aging Londoners
According to a study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British survey shows the Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analyzes the most toxic fine particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retirees in London is two and a half years older than, for example, an adult living in rural areas.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, suffer from nearly 9 500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk especially for those Londoners who go on a business trip walking around crowded streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution with various masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes cheated - poking the man standing in front
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the brakes of the tractor betrayed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man didn’t stay under it, but the tractor was able to push the man so much that he was transported to the central hospital with serious injury to further examinations.
The tractor didn’t flow further, as it collided with the stones in front.
Fun with new strength for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, starts with a series starting in October from a better starting point than a man’s memory.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common tune can be found more confidently than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been gloomy for Riennon.
Jani Säisä, who continues as the head coach of Riento, praises the new team as an entrepreneur and cohesive.
Fred Musoni starts his second season in Rienno.
The new face is Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played in Rwanda’s national team, is a 205-centimetre chipper.
Garchet is similarly a passer, the Brazilian measures 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and Jokipojat to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing almost all floorball World Championships since 2003.
Now in Tampere there are already the sixth races, only 2013 was missed after Canada had been better in North American qualifying.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed a report.
The USA was in the process of establishing a floorball team.
I became interested and now we are here, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967, near New York, in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen studied data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at the Finnish Championship level as floorball.
The floorball was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipojat hockey in the Finnish Championships, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship in 1991-92, followed by three in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club for the A-girls championship.
Women’s Finnish Championship career culminated in silver 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played through the women’s Finnish Championships 10, the balance in 169 games was 51+34=85.
The latest Finnish Championship season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
The Joensuu-based floorball club, Josban, was brought up by Perttu Puska and the Eno-based Tatu Väänänen, was chosen to join the Finnish national team who played in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on November 6-8.
Perttu Puska, 25-year-old in the Helsinki-based wilderness, has played this before six men’s international matches, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen from Wiler-Ersigen from Switzerland has recovered from the thigh pain and is part of the team’s standard fleet with 117 ground matches.
The national team was also named Mika Kohonen, a veteran player of the Seinäjoki Game Brothers, who was last seen on the Finland shirt in the last December World Cup.
The main coach of the Floorball team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley expert Essi Hasu’s circle closes in Kouvola - SM-kulta is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is ending as a beach volley player at least after a temporary season.
The Finnish Championships in Beach volley will be held in Kouvola Sports Park during the weekend.
In three days, the medals are played in both adult and youth leagues.
In cooperation with the Finnish Volleyball Association and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best pairs in each league will be eligible for the final tournament.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will get to the auditorium during the weekend.
There will surely be a great arena for the peis stadium.
I haven’t played very often in the adult leagues in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu feels.
The Kouvola region lit up Hasu’s spark for sports and gave good food for a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in Elimäen NMKY’s E-girls.
The top is a shirt too big in mind, knee pads on the ankles, as well as awe-inspiring cries and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone’s families were strongly involved in the activities - the teammate’s father coached us and our mother was the club chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was a natural choice for the balance of indoor volleyball already during the junior season.
The beach at the Käyrälampi lake has been playing beach since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active at the bus stop.
I also went to follow the Finnish Junior Championships myself, thinking that some day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki in the SM-finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the second-ranked duo’s goal is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We are still missing Finnish Championship gold in the prize cabinet, Hasu throws in a mysterious way.
The performance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last in front of a familiar audience for Hasu.
New challenges await in civilian work at the beginning of September.
International career is over after the tournament at Kisakallio.
Otherwise, flip-flops are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Overflow fell tents at an event for the disabled in Joensuu, a major accident was close

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweating and vigor.
The young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he also believes in a positive future in the countryside.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his little brother Valtteri Koli started their operations as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
As a rural entrepreneur, it was important to start taking debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come into the hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since the little boy.
I’m always happy to be on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything in the game.
If something starts, then I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a barn, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I was very brave enough to join the project and I have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything is still good.
The aim of Salomon Koli, which grows meat trucks, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the young food producer competition of the magazine Rural Future.
He is currently competing for a potential win.
You can vote on the magazine’s website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for many years (after June 2012) and the first time it rises to more than zero after last October, when the country reported 0.2% of positive inflation.
The annual average inflation measured by the CPI over the past 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) from the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
Compared to June 2016, the consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 % compared to December 2015) has been -0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2 %.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, the prices of the following consumer goods categories showed an increase: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and periodic maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat’s anime effect is criticized as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers find it racist.
Snapchat’s lens tool allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that bring absurdity closer together.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, dog or figure in Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Lenses are unpretentious, feature-distorting tools that create more than 30 million boosted selfies per day.
All missteps quickly become known to the general public.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized for being the beauty ideal for blackface makeup or bleached skin tones.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes crooked, distorted their teeth and made their cheeks plump, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered if these recurring conflicts suggest a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and was written by e.g. online publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat reportedly removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of infringing stereotypes.
Some disputed fiercely the anime parable.
The Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet of images was widely shared, said in his email that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing".
He adds: "It is difficult to dispute the contrast of a very tasteless Asian caricature with filter effects.
It shows that the filter isn't just "yellowface", but taken to a degrading extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
The American culture seems to have endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and equipment that we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience consists of young people with more ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts, which can mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that hurts the user, this type of thing is no longer very easy to miss, as before,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
As a Product Manager and Designer, Zhu, working on the Medium release platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In a paper and telephone interview published in Medium, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticised the company for most of the leaders made up of white and only men and finished his writing with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
It is either that their unilateral staff have no colored people, so they can make such decisions, or they also have colored as employees, but their position is not such that they would dare to express their opinions directly and easily" says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, in a private business.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to its spokesperson, the company has recently hired a recruiter whose purpose is to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promote participation within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congress Expert Group, military officials distorted intelligence about the fathers
On Thursday, the Congress Expert Group published a report that officials under the command of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Central Command, changed the intelligence reports so that they would give a more optimistic picture of the war against the Isis in Iraq and Syria than what the incidents gave in the field to understand.
The Republican Chairs of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, which is responsible for intelligence and defence appropriations, set up a working group, which reports on the “general dissatisfaction” of military intelligence analysts.
Central Command, briefly Centcom, is the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, and is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The intelligence results approved by the senior leaders of Centcom gave a generally more positive picture of the US counter-terrorism measures than the facts showed in the field, and were, without exception, more positive than those of the other intelligence community units," is described in the press release on the report.
Centcom events cannot be accepted – our soldier suffers when false analyses are presented to high-level political decision-makers," says California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
The mistakes in Centcom's management go to the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report provides a detailed overview of the ongoing 2014 and 2015 issues that Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that reports ordered by Obama’s administrative authorities are false, it provides an image of analysts that gives the impression that Centcom’s leaders would have pressured them to provide a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and testimonies to the Congress were much more positive than the events actually were," says the report.
For example, Centcom's official made a public statement that a large military assault on Mosul could already take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
After months of research, this is very clear," says Mike Pompeo, the Republican representative of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, intelligence leaders at the highest position of the U.S. Armed Forces manipulated the intelligence results obtained to undermine the threat of Isis in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group upon receiving knowledge of the doubts expressed by analysts as to how intelligence about the Isis would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will follow more detailed results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has initiated an investigation concerning Centcom’s intelligence data.
On Thursday, the Democratic Members of the Representative House Intelligence Committee published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process to evaluate intelligence about the Isis and Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, a high-ranking democratic agent of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, "insulted the morality of analysts" and "insist insufficiently of dissenting views".
According to Schiff and the democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom’s analysts to adapt their conclusions to the “predetermined or political official line”.
News website Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the study conducted by the Congress.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by Pentagon’s Senior Inspector, which began as a result of actions by Centcom’s analysts.
In a press release, Pentagon spokesperson, Lieutenant-Command Patrick Evans, says that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the report of the Congress as long as the investigation of the Supreme Inspector is ongoing.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of relevant information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security topics."
The investigation has other consequences beyond the attempt to determine whether bombings led by the United States in Iraq and Syria have been successful (argument raised by more and more defense authorities).
Last year, however, the arguments put forward made it questionable how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command and give honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The critique of intelligence on the fathers corresponded to disputes that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study stating that the government of President George W. Bush, despite the protests of many analysts, only supported small forces in Iraq and spent little time considering what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the revolt on intelligence about the Fathers.
According to the authorities, last year, Hooker’s working group concluded that despite counter-public statements, the expressions in ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group’s economy, as it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the result of the study was not transferred outside Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was critiqued last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimonies given to the Senate had been too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins the fourth duel in the women's field hockey and consolidates its position in the middle with the UK
After scoring three goals in a victorious, goals 6-1-solution against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women’s national hockey team on Thursday, when the U.S. defeated India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a big achievement, but 27-year-old Bam wasn’t sure if he used to succeed in the same way.
I have no idea," he says.
I don't belong to people who like reading about the goals they make."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share their first place in their group with the UK, who continued his winning streak as they won 2–0.
The UK and the United States will play against the other hand on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final, which determines which one is the first of the six teams and which one is the second.
The first runner avoids a longer meeting with the hard Dutch team who won the second group.
Despite how the Saturday game goes, the Americans have already stirred up for their surprising success at these races, four years after it was the last 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a ground hockey club for the first time only at the age of 3 (his older double sister played the sport in Drexel) and reached the national team at the age of 16 and was thus the youngest national team player of all time.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he did not qualify for the final roster.
After that came the 2012 games where he and his team had hardly seen any successes.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed as the coach, after which things began to change.
The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
Our pace of work in London wasn't as it is now.
We have made a full translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal account in the first half, hitting the ball close by with a knuckle in.
India had come to the game without any tournament win, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and kept the 1-0 all the way to the third episode when Bam stepped into the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, swirled into the middle field, punched the ball to the finish line and led the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first one in the tournament where US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty, and in the first three games, the American goal had been sunk by each one hit.
Briggs is now living for a season of success,
as well as Bam.
Our ranking is now good," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the middle of Olympiahuli trampoline brings zen
Regardless of the place and time, the Olympics will inevitably come across.
The events, competitions and struggles of Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as a passionate message all the time and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself was a flaming message stick that moves from an archer to a swimmer, from a swimmer to an gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can’t open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor’s conversation about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or a dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympics’ first time Dooley charms with a smile and might well be the name on everyone’s lips, which would be seen and heard at the best time of watching and listening, would be popular with sponsors and would appear on TV ads with a good mind if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on trampoline.
Olympiatuli does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade are lesser-known sports such as air gun shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breast swim, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest thing about my own special favorites, I want to pay attention to the discreet charm of trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the past 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed didn’t even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be region-specific.
While athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic Games, the country has never reached the medals and did not advance to the finals until 2012.
In the men’s trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women’s side, the medal catch has been taken by the Canadians.
China’s Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, the trampoline has the charm of an underdog, partly because it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I confess in this connection that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The sport has its comical potential, used in cartoons in the endless bursting scenes of characters, but it also has the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming jumping, i.e. in sports that are essentially associated with the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "a springboard".
Ambitious masters jump on a huge trampoline that ejects them to a height of almost 10 meters, before landing on their feet, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements such as threads, folds and flips.
According to the official Olympic program, the jumps are judged on the basis of performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries compete for the championship in trampoline gymnastics, 16 of whom are men and 16 are women.
The most common direction of the Olympic sports is directly ahead.
Medal hopes have to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal they are aiming for in TV-rated reportases, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical – and is even enough to get the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting when watching the races only.
For this trampoline offers a respite.
In trampoline, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up unweighted like an astronaut, falls down and falls back up effortlessly.
Of course, the sport also includes a competitive spectacle, and it is not easy, but it does not involve a violent rush to the finish or a long jump, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It is as close to zen as only the Olympic race can get.
Women’s qualifying matches and finals take place on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men’s matching races on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which will start at 14.00 a.m. local time each day.
In the middle of Olympiamania, a peaceful and wonderful moment might go unnoticed in the midst of the general hustle and bustle.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering appealing male athletes and objectifying them – as the US male gymnasts according to the Wall Street Journal recently suggested – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his breath-taking new fan base.
A whole generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-term ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government troops have violently disrupted political demonstrations across Ethiopia.
According to eyewitnesses, several protesters have been shot to death in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable Western ally whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests that are spreading to increasingly larger areas.
Just last week, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a profound political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government’s reaction was ruthless.
According to eyewitnesses, the police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Presumably, videos of demonstrations at the end of last year or early this year show how security forces beat young people with sticks who are forced to stand up against the wall.
The UN’s leading human rights officer now requires in-depth research.
It has always been difficult to keep the country united, and to move on even more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the African Sarvi International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second-largest country in Africa, and its stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The U.S. military and intelligence service are closely supporting the Ethiopian fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and only a few African countries, if anything, will receive so much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, the capital city of Addis Ababa even has a new urban train.
The streets of the cities are usually safe, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model country of democracy; human rights organisations have continuously reported government oppression policy, opposition is very limited in the country, and dissidents are rapidly suppressed.
Many people have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to show their minds, it will be erupted," says Seyoum Teshome, lecturer at Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth shows his mind.
A whole generation protests."
There are many topics of dissatisfaction, always from land use to the choke of the government coalition.
After the broadly criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies finally received a position that previously belonged to the opposition, as a result of which they now dominate the entire parliament.
At the same time, tensions increase at the border of Eritrea, where the escalated situation required hundreds of death victims in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years, more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People’s Liberation Front, may attempt to exploit confusion and rearm.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been felt under the surface for years is breaking out right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only for the past couple of years, Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media when cheaper smartphones became common and internet availability improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many can access the internet through proxy servers that encrypt their whereabouts.
Many young Ethiopians reported that this is how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase of solidarity between Ethiopia’s two largest populations, Oromos and Amharas.
Oromo and Amharic are not all-natural.
Most of Ethiopia’s highlands of Christianity have long dominated the country’s politics and business and deprived the Oromosa, most of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
The cooperation is getting deeper and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Mulatu Gemechu, Oromo Director.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six per cent of the population and yet dominates the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unannounced illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who was able to see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors who reconciled with counterparties.
The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict investigator Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles’s boots almost unfamiliar.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he has no trust in security forces managed by the tigre tribe.
Many people are afraid that this means more bloodshed.
For the last time in Ethiopia, similar riots were attempted in 2005, when thousands showed their minds against elections, which, according to analysts, the government first tuned and then stole.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the preceding months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for far-reaching infrastructure design, such as the new urban train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But internal resentment to the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented intensification.
And resentment is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the Amhara town of Gondar, protesters attacked companies owned by Tigres, and anti-Tigret hate speech is becoming more common on social media.
According to analysts, protests place the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft observing neighbouring Somalia, but the base is recently closed, according to the United States.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable area to collapse.
This requires a tight balance," Abdi says.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama to be the founder of Isis
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back in his latest campaign controversy by claiming that he was not serious about his assertion several times this week as the founders of President Obama and Hillary Clinton terrorist group Isis.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side of the presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of their country.
An awkward situation will also be faced with his supporters, who must try to defend their candidates in these stormy moments and explain comments that he might not have meant.
Trump argued at the election on Wednesday evening and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that he had created the president and Hillary Clinton.
Early on Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump tweeted his speech from the day before, when he said that he had been serious about his accusations in several interviews.
When the radio presenter and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obamahan attempts to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw from his claim.
The latest review storm rose as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as the support figures drop.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes, and kept Clinton’s speech tedious.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he seemed to be urging Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email, later explaining his comments by saying, "I was sarcastic, of course."
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that resonate with his supporters, he sees how the supporters react to the messages, and then "clarifies" in one way or another, depending on the reactions," says communications specialist Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has made his style even more intensifying in recent days as his support numbers have continued to decline.
On Friday, a new opinion study by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist revealed that Trump’s support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while in Florida, the situation is tightly even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But in the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in a embarrassing position, where they have to publicly defend Trump’s comments no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump’s most important supporters, former Mayor of New York Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the presidential candidate vigorously in CNN’s interview on Thursday.
I consider his sayings to be justified, political," replied Giuliani, as he was asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded Isis.
It's true that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama called the "lower league team" completely wrongly, and that's why he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Hillary Clinton was Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to continue its efforts as it did not resolve the situation determinedly in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of his discourses and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He scoffed at "indecent and pathetic" television commentators trying to find him out, but he says he can't succeed in it.
Some democrats mocked Trump’s explanation, and said it would only prove more clearly that he was not suitable as president.
Due to an unreasonable increase in rent, the café opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a boisterous cafe in Williamsburg, where only cash was accepted and there was no Wi-Fi but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its streetside location on Bedford Avenue as the rent got unreasonable.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
The locals consider this loss of a coffee shop that has disappeared from the middle class to be miserable.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York City is changing, I know, but I can't believe that there is no CBGB club anymore, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But while New York is no longer the case, it is also creating something new.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over one kilometre north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still undressed.
Coffee is still good as well.
The owner and manager of the new Verb Cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things intact.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it reintroduced even old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says he still wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
Bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches are available and capers and browned onion rings are available as fillings.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
You can no longer get beer from the café, but instead juices made from fresh fruit.
After nine months in the café, Rodriguez says he noticed that old standard customers started to visit Verb as a steady stream.
Many of our old customers also had to be priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he made walks to Verb in Williamsburg then.
When Verb closed, he says he has stopped drinking coffee for a while.
I realized that I liked Verb’s coffee and culture,” he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, although on that Sunday he took a chai tea blend instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also a list novelty.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He always visited the cafe before work and ordered the same.
I stepped into the café every day for more than seven minutes, like a machine, and there they already prepared my butterbagels with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but from time to time he varies his bagel’s bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says it doesn’t take a grudge to the fact that the soap trade took the old place.
Soap Cherie’s owners even offered to prepare a special soap, which is made using Verb’s own cold-brewed coffee.
We may still grab an offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says he’s looking for a suitable place for his new neighbours to feel welcome.
A new place has brought with it other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell the cold stewed coffee in the cafe.
The café may also expand to the next building.
However, for many customers it is enough for them to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer at Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the cafe was closed.
When the new place opened and I ordered the coffee there, it felt like arriving home, says Whitt.
I missed the smell of the cafe."
The gloomy food of the Great Depression in a new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the culinary artist, was fond of the luxury cuisine of Fifth Avenue restaurants, including goose liver paste and Maryland turtle soup.
That day his menu was more modest: devil’s eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and plum pudding for dessert.
It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The community living in Brooklyn Heights works as both food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which depicts the history of American food in the great depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity as they agreed with the supplier to meet Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in the same year as a big stock exchange crash, in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the supplier ordered a meat loaf, the couple said it was suitable for a discussion on eating a very large lay season.
The crumbs were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
People ate peanuts, liver crumbs and bean crumbs.
They were made from substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe grins.
It must have been pressed in the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great recession years American dining table especially in the countryside worked on the buffet principle "eat as much as you like".
Women made food for farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans had just sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War, and A Square Meal is a chronicle of the way people survived when they suddenly had to give up abundance.
This was the time when food became a central and distressing topic of the Americans" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new affordable diet: According to Zieglerman, the enigmatic dishes such as tenders and stew dishes became the main food, and pot dishes were said to be a "great way to take advantage of food scraps" because chefs could not cover such attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been the most important part of the American meal for years, became a sparingly used luxury.
We tried out strange blends, where the most important thing was to meet calorie and nutritional values and not so much taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
When doing research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared baked onions filled with peanut butter, which were used as a shortage of dishes.
It wasn't popular at the dinner table," says Coe, where
More about Ziegelma: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onion do not match at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who served as the head of the Federal Government in 1923–1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be precise budget managers and respond to the challenge of making quirky dishes like carrot cream spaghetti.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are the explanations of government reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “let me eat cake” attitude.
As he publicly praised the simple food of his childhood on an iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and sophisticated gentleman who had become of him.
He liked continental European cuisine like fish and cucumber sauce" says Coe.
He ate almost in the gold-clad dining room, with a tuxedo on his head.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to show an example on his stomach.
As stated in the book, with Mrs. Roosevelt hiring a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, the dishes served in the White House were not only Washington's most boring, but also the worst prepared."
Many of the recession foods were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple says that they started to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, why he couldn’t throw food away.
He really feared that food would have to be thrown away," says Coe.
People even began to feel bad about his food," says Ziegelman.
For example, once from wind hats."
After the main plates had been emptied at Eisenberg’s lunch bar, Ziegelma and Coe brought out the plum dessert they had prepared at home, the same one that President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, adding that giving an impressive name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We submerged our spoons reluctantly into a thick brown bump.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad either.
Coe was sniffing for the second time and third.
The walnuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Gilead fully compensates for attorneys’ fees for patent disputes with Merck regarding hepatitis C medication
The judge of the U.S. Regional Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full compensation for attorneys’ fees arising from a patent dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released for damages of $200 million, which it had been prescribed for the violation of two patents owned by Merck in connection with the successive drugs called Sovaldi and Harvoni in Gilead, and the American judge found that Merck had committed a violation, including committing the wrong whale and other unethical practices.
In an action recorded on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the U.S. Regional Court says that Gilead was entitled to an exemption from the attorneys’ fees incurred in defending the case.
Merck tries to reach Gilead, who manages the market with next-generation hepatitis C drugs, which can treat over 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded private ownership of the sophosbuvir under laboratory work, which is the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
U.S.-backed troops have taken Manbij city from Isis
The U.S.-supported troops have been seized by the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border, when the last extremist organization ISIS fighters left the city, says the spokesperson of the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group now raked the city to find the last Isis fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbiji military council of SDF, told Reuters that the 2 000 hostages captured by the fighters of ISIS have been released.
The city is now entirely in our possession, but we are still conducting exploration operations," said Darwin.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent federal tax
Hillary Clinton, the presidential candidate for the democrats, announced his 2015 tax return, showing that his and his husband’s income at the time was $10.75 million and their actual federal tax rate was 34.2.
In 2015, Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, with former President Bill Clinton earning nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, who previously served as Minister for Foreign Affairs, announced that he had earned $3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for his book on his post at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Vice President, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and his wife Anne Holton published 10-year tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3.
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show the model for financial transparency,” says Jennifer Palmieri, Campaign Assistant at Clinton.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax information.
According to custom, U.S. presidential candidates have always made their tax information public, even though the law does not require them to do so.
Trump, a New York-based businessman, and his lawyer, have appealed to the Tax Administration for a review and say why Trump hasn’t disclosed his income data.
The move is yours" tweeted Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams, referring to the democratic candidate's tax information.
On Thursday, Trump’s Special Adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he wouldn’t let Trump publish his tax information until the checks are complete.
Trump’s reviewers, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump’s equity, his contributions to charity, his business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken this question and posted a video online on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release their tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not his public tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico online magazine, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid only a little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue for presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a provision named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than $1 million per year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama is also in favour of the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton election held in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, headquartered in the same place, challenged Trump to meet with both of them to disclose their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been audited by the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Clintons who now reside in the city of Chappaqua in the State of New York paid a real federal tax of 32 percent on average between 2007 and 2014, and the actual compound tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
It is apparent from Clinton’s 2015 tax return that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was wage earnings.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and Clintons reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chilli powder filled firecracker condoms to support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature preservers in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep the elephants away from the human settlement – the elephants are hurried by throwing condoms filled with chili powder towards them.
The method has proved to be effective, and the idea was invented a few years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the American Nature Conservancy, to teach the volunteers of the villages of Northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and farms without harming elephants.
Some time ago, spears were used to evict the elephants.
Friday is the elephant day of the world dedicated to the protection of animals.
After developing the method, we have seen attitudes change in these villages, because now the villagers can trust that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation in his press release.
First, the intrusive elephant is embarrassed by pointing at the flashlight and playing the horn.
If this does not work, a so-called chili cloud is thrown.
The chilli powder mixed with the soil is put into the condom together with the firing, after which the end of the condom is twisted so that only the ignition wire is left out.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine chili powder cloud into the air.
Usually, one spice cloud is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last method is a thrower that shoots a fireworks known as a Roman candle into the air and creates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes the Berlin hotel for raising the Israeli dialect on the "request of the Arabs" – RT News
The French, Jewish film director, gave birth to a media rage after revealing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not mention the Israeli area code in its country number list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary, broke his frustration with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
With a recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the area code list Israel offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries that you can call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the option to call Israel via a dedicated call center.
The film director asked for an explanation of the matter at the reception of the hotel.
Lanzmann writes a reply from the receptionist that shocked him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was a decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels.
The reason behind the action shocked the film director even further.
According to Lanzmann, the officer said: "The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they require the removal of the Israeli dialing code."
Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, the German ambassador to Israel, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said the case "great disgrace".
The case shocks and shocks us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more disgrace it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and it is precisely this hotel chain.
There is no need for more explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says Ambassador.
The case caused a fairly counter-reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some blamed the Kempinski hotel for simply giving up on alleged Arabic guests’ demands.
Disgrace" was said in a publication where the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm street was highlighted.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel has quickly denied the charges, called an error and apologized by Lanzmann.
The direct command to exclude Israel from the list of codes was never given," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel representative who said.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets in the demonstration of Brazilian students
The students teamed up with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered together to demonstrate their minds against the reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riot began when law enforcement attempted to break down the student population, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration, who wanted to show their astonishment to the government plans.
Geraldo Alckmin, Governor of the State of Sao Paulo, has made a proposal for a savings measure in connection with which nearly a hundred public schools will be closed and 300 000 students will be placed in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, which were temporarily opposed to Michel Temer, who was in charge of the President’s office.
The students’ demonstration took place only a few days after the streets were filled with distinguished President Dilma Rousseff from profitable demonstrators as the Senate of the country voted for office charge.
Trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 71% – RT Business
Following the closure of the sanctions, the annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent, says Russian Ambassador of Iran Levan Dzhagarya.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were reversed.
Russian companies continue their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, growing trade further is one of the primary goals of cooperation between countries," Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 per cent to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The sale was driven by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran granted approximately 35 000 visas to Iranan citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the 20 first countries to be visited by citizens in Russia.
And it’s not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes to change.
I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz, and Yazd that have maintained the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scots Callum Skinner raced to the finish line when the British beats the gold of cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner slashed with fame in the men’s team print at Rio’s Velodrome last night when the UK trio defended the 2012 championship in London.
The Glasgow-based 23-year-old Skinner played the role of an anchor he inherited from his compatriots, the Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, who made the legend proud as he flew to the finish line and picked up a win from the New Zealand team considered a pre-favorite.
The UK made a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth in six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after they had finished sixth in the World Championships in March London, despite Hoy having since left his competitive career.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for Jamie Staff, who specialises in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to close the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man that British coaches believed in and where they saw the potential he has now claimed.
Hindes, with Hoy the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made the Olympic record in qualifying, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in the duel.
Hindes was close behind him after his tour, but Kenny struggled to lead the team, which Skinner kept.
Much of the change was a change in the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the pace with a larger gear, thanks to which Kenny and especially Skinner were able to keep the pace.
Hoy followed her position as BBC commentator and reached out to Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they stepped on the podium.
The Glasgow-based 23-year-old Skinner says: "I'm flattered by the parallel.
I just try to do my best and succeed.
We made the Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was amazing.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had accidentally crashed on the track due to a bad start.
Later, he canceled his word, and the British rivals did not have a way of complaining.
This time, there were no such problems associated with a sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The atmosphere was like in London, all UK flags fluttered in the auditorium.
Our team became unified in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that victory at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten circuit championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the past five months, then five days of Velodrome will be successful ahead.
As Kenny has shown with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold at one of the Olympics.
This would mean the accrual of the account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya and also born on 23 March (a magical date of British sports, also a birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medal achievements would then be the same as at Hoy.
Kenny competes in the next sprint that starts today and decides after three days.
Bolton's 28-year-old Kenny says: "I can only enjoy this right now.
The team competition is always the best.
You get to enjoy the win together with your friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get the value of the knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man team chase.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, made in London 2012 and won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (at 22.42) will be raced today on the second day of the race, and the focus of attention is certainly Wiggins.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competition officials before the qualifying period when the officials invited him to measure his length.
In the same competition for women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached the world record 4:13.260.
The UK team can now trust that its great track cycling team will take over the middle stage of the Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
After truly exceptional evidence from full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
The background has been dramas, the least of which is not the resignation of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April among claims of sexism and bullying, and the end of the competition between major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
On the first evening, however, the races at the Velodrome show that the British reputation for being topped at the perfect moment once again.
The future of Portland smelter at stake due to the end of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminum smelter in Victoria, Portland, and thus thousands of employees are at stake when the smelting power company told that one of the factory’s owners is about to terminate the delivery contract and it is expected that all delivery contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision of the Government of Victoria earlier this year not to continue to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed, 20-year support will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs are at risk of disappearing from Alcoa’s Portland plant.
Due to liquidation, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to grow, as the melting plant consumes about 10% of all electricity production in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter, which led to Anglesea's power plant being closed last year.
The Alcoan Portland smelter loses money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures correspond to the speculations that took place for years in the factory’s future, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently the price of the factory’s production.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it expects that three other smelters will also cease their contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares in the plant.
AGL says that it expects the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that the demand for physical electricity from the smelter continues.
AGL states that the agreements were so-called hedging agreements, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period of the agreements is 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
Thus, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017", says the power plant.
The potential return effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by the strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that the value of contracts has already been reduced by $187 million in bookkeeping as a prediction for the termination of contracts.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “do not affect Alcoa ... the capacity to keep the smelter operational or secure the electricity supply to the smelter”.
The American company said it had made a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was to take effect since November of this year, although it still has to figure out why it has now been withdrawn from the contract.
Due to the poor economic situation in the industry, analysts have been cautious about their assessments of both the smelter in Portland State of Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
AGL’s Chief Operating Officer Stephen Mikkelsen told the analysts in his previous speech that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
If these factories exit the market, it means a significant decrease in demand (electricity) in the market.
It would not be good news for us as a producer," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians reality TV star Kendall September as Vogue's cover girl
The model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and his mother and manager Kris’s fourth daughter Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of the American Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s advertising face and appeared in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
Looking at the cover in the room, full of my loved ones, made me tear," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover image was followed by a strange (or perhaps just a Kardashian series of style) video featuring all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (Bartender Rob and Caitlyn and everyone’s favorite, producer of the Kardashians program Ryan Seacrest), who forgot the cover image of his sister, which ended with a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is clichéd, and it is used in almost all of the birthday episodes of the degree programs (Seacrest says: "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to bring some other daughter into this publicity.
For the appearance in Vogue's September issue is undeniably a new era of the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim could make Vogue's appearance before (he appeared on Vogue's cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is in a class of his own.
September's issue is Vogue's best-selling release a year.
The number that resembles a larger picture book than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site from Fashion declined that last year’s 832-page opus had 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the cover star of September is expected to be so intense that in the previous two years, the pictures of the magazine have leaked to the public already before the official announcement.
Previously, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss have been the cover models for September.
In recent years, the cover has had celebrities that work on the model rather than models that are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior ad face Jennifer Lawrence was in the cover photo in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as the success model of her generation, and even if she is more among the celebrities working on the model, she is still in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars or modern-day children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all about these).
They can be rightly called talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce has one of the strongest years in his career, when he released his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner’s success.
Because of his reality TV background, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitches".
These feelings have resurfaced when the news about Jenner’s appearance on Vogue’s cover came forth.
However, the constant upset of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is Vogue's September number cover design.
He is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She walks in Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
She is the promotional face of Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she described to the LOVE magazine.
And in her free time she performs on a real TV, perhaps just as a way to meet her sister and her children.
Legal Aid Centres turn away 160 000 people per year
Every year, the most vulnerable people in more than 160 000 countries are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the effects that additional cuts of appropriations will have on centres already operating at the limit.
In the State of Queensland, free legal aid and legal services are already turned away from the five people – most of them are elderly, immigrants, disadvantaged workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without people fighting resources.
Public legal aid services, the burden of which is already overburdened, prepare for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of further loss of 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, says that according to the latest National Agency for Legal Aid Centers, thousands of people are turned away from the centres every year.
If the Federal Government does not spin its decision, Farrell says that the situation will only get worse.
The Queensland Public Legal Aid Centers are underfunded at all times, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the necessary services when they seek them," says Farrell.
People from violent relationships, people under uncontrollable and crippled debts, divergent families, unjustified dismissal workers – all of them have problems with legal issues, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut financing by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the weakest in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and the Senator of Queensland to George Brands to immediately hand over these financial cuts so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise of bringing legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to consider the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued when some actions were presumably not taken after it had been reported to its management that the campaign leader in North Carolina had threatened an employee with a weapon while driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by Vincent Bordini, former software trainer of the state campaign, at the state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini says that she has waited months for the campaign to be dealt with internally before she understood, in her own words, that this will not happen.
Bordini says in his action that campaign leader Earl Phillip "came out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and put the barrel on Vincent's kneecap."
According to the claim, Bordini heard that at least four other people had experienced the same Phillip as the local and regional management of the campaign.
Even if the weapon does not trigger, it will cause damage," says Bordini in his action.
Only two days after the Republican presidential candidate gave rise to general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "supporters of the second additional article" – who hold arms owners and armies – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets the choice of judges.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media disconnected his words from the context and Trump did not encourage violence.
In his action, Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for indifference and Phillip’s compensation for overcoming, assault and mental suffering caused by them.
Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking him to comment.
Despite the companies, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte’s local news agency, WCCB, told Phillip that the campaign had just been left.
No immediate response was received to the call request submitted to Phillip Consulting Company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been a controversial campaign.
Legal case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
The British must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was a point that was of most interest to Heathrow, and as at the 2012 London Olympics, we invested enormously in the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which eliminates youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
Like at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think the Heathrow expansion is too big a challenge.
When it came to the Olympics, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will face a embarrassing situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question it asks.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many instead of few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and grow the economy by £211 billion, bringing expertise and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a time and budget investment program of £11 billion, including the T5 terminal – voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, built in the middle of the two most crowded runways in the world.
Now they are ready to produce the third runway, backed by a £16 billion private investment.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be the extension of Heathrow.
It’s time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the talent and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow and the former Commercial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad blocker in cat-mouse play
The efforts of companies that make money from online advertising to distract from ad blocking software have turned into a cat mouse play, says one company that produces blocking programs.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook had announced that it was blocking ad blockers, Adblock Plus posted a blog post where it told users that its blocking software filters could be updated and thus again blocked by social media ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the markup codes for ads on its desktop site so that it is more difficult to identify which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock now says that it has cleared up new codes.
In his blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of ballot between the open-source ad blocker community and biasers has been running since the ad blocker was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own correction.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has participated in the battle is a strong indication of how much concern ad blockers have become in the industry.
Approximately 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, says a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users on mobile devices every day, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is going to invest in deceiving ad blockers in its desktop app, as the advertiser says that mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from Desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it updated the advertising tool in the user settings so that users can more control how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock’s new filters, as they also prevent the appearance of some regular Facebook posts.
This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem" said Facebook spokesperson in his email notification.
Ad blockers are clumsy and inefficient, which is why we have instead invested in the development of user settings such as ad tools so that people can control the targeting of ads themselves."
Woman committed suicide by freezing under cars on the Swiss highway
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for help from eyewitnesses on the highway from the accident that occurred in the first hours of Thursday, where a woman deliberately left under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the Canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman made her desperate act by laying down on the dark road, and she was hit by several cars, says the police of Vaud in their announcement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with a clear aim to commit suicide, including a truck.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many motorists who were involved in an accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified, and the police ask them or other witnesses of an accident to register.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter explains in Le Tribune de Geneve that a criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the motorists involved in the accident are charged.
Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains to be investigated by the prosecutor," says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases on the basis of which motorists are not considered responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person walked on the dark highway and the court decided that motorists cannot expect to bump into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police authorities were released from a charge that had been brought against him after he had come across a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one of the August night of 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had enjoyed plenty of alcohol and turned off on the road.
The court considered that the driving style of the police, which was responding to the emergency call, was justified and the man lying on the road was a "completely exceptional and unforeseen situation".
Anyone who knows about an accident near Morges on Thursday should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to explore Venus’ past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The purpose of the model was to determine whether conditions in Venus could sometimes be similar to those in the world, even though Venus is hot and water-free and its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide.
According to researchers’ previous presentations, Venus’ slow rotation speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to the Earth, and it has, despite that, been running slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early surface formation of Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but there may have been enough water and fluctuation to maintain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% fainter.
In GISS's modelling, Venus is running slowly and its day side is almost two months at a time for the sun," says Anthony Del Genio, Research Scientist at GISS.
This heats up the surface and creates rain that creates a thick layer of cloud, which acts like an umbrella and protects the surface much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the current temperatures in the Earth.
The model was used to create Venus’s story, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists in its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, for several billion years it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated, and the ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
As hydrogen escaped into space, only a thick carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect remained – that is, Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modelling in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy gives up his place as Avalache coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and deputy leader of the club's ice hockey operations, claiming the lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado Executive Vice President/President Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately start applying for a new coach.
For the last three years, I have held my position as the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the deputy leader of the club's ice hockey activities with energy, passion and determination," says 50-year-old Roy in his communication.
During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the required depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vice president of the coach and club’s ice hockey activities must be fully aligned with the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are not met at the moment."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Patrick told me about his decision today," says Sakic.
We are grateful for all that he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the good for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league’s best coach of the year for his first season as Avalanchen’s head coach in 2013–2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and did not qualify for a sequel in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in the season 2015–2016 and stayed five points away from Minnesota Wild while playing another Wild Card slot at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalache.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop the strike
The main negotiators say that the North Sea oil workers’ pay strikes will be interrupted when all parties involved in the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, an oilfield service provider, has been engaged in strikes on drilling rigs under Royal Dutch Shell’s management in the North Sea.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week we will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will discuss problems with fresh aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, which, according to them, were the first in more than 25 years, as a protest for possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut around 9% of its contractors’ tariffs in the North Sea this year.
The reduction in the company’s tariffs is based on a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, additional cuts give it a room for movement that is necessary to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has eliminated thousands of employees from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas drilling operations in up to 10 countries, aiming to enhance its operations after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK decision to leave the European Union in June create pressure for energy companies.
Dave Anderson, Member of the Scottish Parliament, met with workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many and not just a few," says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to be under $1.4 billion in 2016, with around $7 billion spent over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Plejad cluster
The latest task of the Kepler space telescope has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of rotational rates of stars in the Plejad cluster so far.
Based on the new data, astronomers are able to find out why stars in the same cluster are rotating at different speeds and how circulatory times are related to the planetary formation.
We hope that by comparing the results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star weight and age and even the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre at Caltech in Pasadena.
The star cluster of the Plejads is located 445 light-years from the Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adult age.
They are currently spinning faster than ever.
When the rotation speed is at its peak, large amounts of stellar wind are erupted from the adult stars.
These winds have a brake effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots (that correspond to sunspots).
The latest listed rotation speed data suggests that larger stars will rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers – the bigger ones spin slower than the smaller ones.
We can see from Plejad's "dance" that the slow-spinning ones are typically larger, while the fastest ones are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
As the star cluster of Plejads is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare star properties to rotation rates.
The star cluster of the Plejads provides a support pillar for theoretical models on the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues will present their latest analysis of Plejad's rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
