Wales Representatives are afraid of looking stupid
Some members of the Representative Council are embarrassed by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Kohu began with a plan to change the name of the Representative Council to the Wales Parliament.
The members of the Representative Council, regardless of the political position, are concerned that the change may make them mock.
According to a representative of a working party, the group is concerned that the name “arms with words Twp and Pwp.”
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, twp means stupidity and pwp means poop.
According to a Plaid party representative, the majority of the group is “not satisfied” and has proposed other options.
According to the Conservative Party representative, his group takes the name change with an open mind, but points out that the word MWP has a short verbal leap into the word for stupidity.
In Welsh, the w-letter is pronounced in this context similar to the English U-letter of Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Representative Council, which is currently drafting the legislative amendment necessary for the amendment of the name, said: “The final decision on the titles describing the members of the Representative Council belongs to the members of the Representative Council of course.”
The Wales Administration Act of 2017 empowers the Representative Council to change its name.
In June the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the appointment of the Representative Council as the Wales Parliament enjoys broad support.
The Commission favoured the Wales Parliament members or the abbreviation WMP as the title of the members of the Representative Council, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion survey.
The members of the Representative Council apparently propose alternative titles, but the lack of consensus can cause headaches for President Elin Jones, who is expected to propose a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments includes other changes to the activities of the Representative Council, such as the rules on the loss of representation and the format of the committee system.
In the legislative procedure, members of the Representative Council may give their final vote on what title they should be called.
Macedonians go to the ballot in the referendum on the change of the country’s name
On Sunday, voters vote on whether the country’s name is changed to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The aim of the referendum is to resolve the dispute with Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the North Neighbor is practically an area requirement for it and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
Macedonia’s President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of referendum such as Prime Minister Zora Zaev argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for the EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells are silenced as Harlem churches live in difficult times
The elderly people I have talked to say that before every street corner there was a bar or church,” says Adams.
Today, there is neither.”
He said that losing bars is understandable.
He said that “communication with people has changed.”
Bars are no longer the common living rooms in the neighbourhood, where people gather regularly.”
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not go as far as the managers imagine, “and sooner or later they have returned to the starting box.”
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments, which residents are not those that would support the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
Absolutely more people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and thus they will have to have the day when these churches permanently shut their doors, because it is unlikely that most people moving to these apartments would become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by caucasian congregations before Harlem became a black residential area - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original Caucasian Methodist Church moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby parish of the blacks acquired the building.
St Martins took over the Blacks' congregation under the leadership of pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the merchants of Harlem's central trading street 125th Street against their objectioned hiring or promotion of blacks.
The fire that broke out in 1939 badly damaged the building, and when father Johnson's parishioners planned reconstruction, they introduced a tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son and successor of Johnson at St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the tower clock game in July called it another “cultural treasure” and an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Michigan University expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the world’s first tower game played by a black musician, the Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins did not replace him.
St. Martins has developed a complex pace over the past few months, which involves architects and contractors hired by church laymasters and the Episcopal Diocese.
In July, an administrative body composed of the lay leaders of the Sakasti church wrote that the Diocese expressed its concern that the diocese “trolling costs” to the sakast, even though it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some parishioners complained about lack of transparency in the Diocese.
Hai injured a 13-year-old lobster diver in California
The authorities report that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and damaged him while the boy dives lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas just before the morning seven.
Chad Hammel told San Diego that he had dived with his friends on Saturday morning about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, and he and the group paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had thought first that the boy was just excited to catch a lobster, but then realized that he was shouting, “I was bitten!”
I was bitten!'
After reaching the boy, Hammel says that he noticed that his whole collarbone had torn open.
I shouted everyone out of the water: there’s a shark in the water!” added Hammel.
The boy was flew to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of attacked shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a media event that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim was severely injured in his upper body.
The authorities closed the beaches from the Ponto Beach in Casablad to the Swam in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's Going to UK Beauty Industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams department store-style beauty departments with expert advice.
This is a significant business for the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow even though fashion and home goods sales are deteriorating, with larger beauty departments trying out 11 stores across the country and expanding to other stores next year.
Beauty products are placed because supermarkets aim to fill the shelf space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's says its beauty product range doubles to 3 000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand specific areas like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique make-up range, and in the future, the majority of the products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop is trying out rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon in South London, and the second opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the transfer of groceries to small one-time purchases in neighbourhood stores forces supermarkets to come up with new incentives for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look even more like department stores as supermarket chain struggles against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
Having bought both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also Habitat stores, which says that the company has promoted the sale of food and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments in its previous company.
Sainsbury's experimented with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute about how the profits of pharmacies located in supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy follows the acquisition in which Sainsbury's sold its 281 store to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain Celesio three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skincare products to four stores with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are willing to advise customers.
Our range of brands caters to all needs and our attractive environments and convenient locations make us a compelling beauty destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘Furiously’ Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones ‘furious’ when TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their homeware and accessories brands Truly.
The two companies have been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
This Morning program’s 37-year-old host announced their departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last few moments, now planning to focus on her new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was “ragey” at the last Tuesday’s intense meeting at the headquarters of the Jones business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.The star girl on the TV had admitted that her new £1.5 million deal would not leave enough time for their homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and it was doubled by Willoughby’s estimated assets of £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: “Truly was Holly’s most important project.
It was his long-term plan, which had to secure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to go has left everything to astonishment.
No one had faith in Tuesday events so close to the release.
Marlow’s head office has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.”
This Morning presenter is one of the most reliable stars in the UK, and according to experts, his departure can cause a million losses for the company due to product investments, including everything from pillows to candles and clothing to homeware, not to mention a delay in the release.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones moved to chair in March.
Couples are on vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is baking M&S’ new brand ambassador and he will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity.
The source near Jones said the night before, “we don’t comment on his business.”
Tight talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism that would receive in the media for his comment, which some considered inappropriate to the president, as well as his positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, pretending to have a “news anchor” voice.
”I didn’t give up at all.”
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had aroused the first meeting of July as a significant step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, nuclear weapons negotiations have fallen.
After more than three months of Singapore summit in July, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat in North Korea, told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the “equivalent reaction” from the United States to the early arms control measures in North Korea.
Instead, he stated that the United States would continue its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
”It’s great with North Korea,” he said.
We were about to run into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.”
According to him, efforts to improve relationships with Kim have yielded positive results: missile trials have been discontinued, hostages have been helped to freedom and remnants of American soldiers have returned home.
He also defended his unusual style while talking about his relationships with Kim.
It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get 10 000 more into this crowded hall outside, we would have about 200 people standing just there,” Trump said, pointing directly to the audience in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national state of emergency required for international assistance was not declared, even though about 10% of Lombok residents were left homeless.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging,” said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children forms a group of travellers to return, it is not certain whether the foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman of the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian authorities would assess the situation of Palu to see whether international organisations are allowed to participate in the aid work.
Indonesia is still unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account frequent earthquakes.
Although aceh has been built with tsunami shields, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
In the return, people were likely to be lost due to the lack of tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was valid.
Travelling between many Indonesian islands is challenging even in the best conditions.
Natural accidents make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship assigned to help victims of an earthquake in Lombok is on its way to Return, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made the development of the past Indonesian infrastructure into the centre of his electoral campaign, and he has decimated money to improve roads and railways.
However, either the administration has been affected by the financial gap, while the new elections will be approaching next year.
The pressure of either is also increased by the tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted the more ancient form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought on the streets with jungle knives, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, which has led to the death of more than 1000 people and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sank a late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing in the Premier League on Saturday after 89 minutes of painting Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was fed by Xherdan Shaqir, 27 from Chelsea's goal, when his team was in a losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before scooping the shot towards the rear post.
The shot hovered high over the penalty area towards the top right corner.
Eventually, the ball fell over the throwing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
I just tried to make myself play to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible up, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and launched without thinking too much.”
Chelsea led the match in half 1-0 Belgian Eden Hazard painted in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave the heel feed to Mateo Kovacic before swirling away near the midfield and spurting Liverpool to the half-field.
Kovacic played fast wall feeding in the midfield.
Then he released Hazard to the penalty area with a great pass-through.
Hazard escaped from defense and passed Liverpool by Alisson Becker's left foot to the back corner.
Liverpool will face the Champions League in the group stage in Naples on Wednesday at 15 a.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face UEFA Europa League on the Thursday of Videoton at 15 in London.
The number of killed Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
Early on Sunday, the Indonesian disaster agency reported an increase in the number of victims of earthquakes and tsunami deaths to 832.
Sutopo Purwo, the spokesman of the agency, said at a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, when the earthquake of 7.5 magnitude hit Friday and raised waves that were up to six metres high.
The fragments of the collapsed buildings spread widely to the city of Palu, a population of 380 000.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding a stabbed woman to die
The body of a woman in Merseyside, Birkenhead, opened a murder investigation in the morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect of the murder.
The police will ask persons in the area to register if they have seen or heard something.
Criminal commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to everyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard something.
I also appeal to all taxi drivers, especially those who might have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation.”
The police female spokesman has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
Today afternoon, the crime scene has become a woman’s potentially knowledgeable person who has asked about her place of discovery.
As the investigation continues, the police report that they seek to inform the victims of the incident.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told him that no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless to know what had happened.
The residents have just learned that they can go for hours before they are let back in.
One of the officers was heard telling the man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearing woman appeared at the scene.
He repeated repeating that “it’s terrible.”
From two afternoons there were two huts in the isolated area, and outside there was also a third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who supervised the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call anonymously on Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 using the ID number 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament became part of a rewrite of history
Ejection of the statue would be poetic justice, considering that his own fanatical puritan supporters destroyed England’s cultural and religious memorabilia like the best Talibans.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick’s proposal for “sippyness” and “rewriting history.”
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the discourse on the statues would make a target of the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or implement the iconoclasm of the English Civil War.
The wrong Cromwell might have to suffer from the works of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent description of Cromwell embodies the opinions of the nineteenth century and is a historical proof of the character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, though perhaps more in the 1800s than today, consider Cromwell a defender of the Parliament against the external pressure that, of course, caused the monarchy in this case.
Whether it is a precise description of the subject matter is the subject of a continuous debate.
At least, it is certain that the mid-1600s dispute has shaped the later development of our nation, while Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a state administrator deserve praise and remembrance.”
Killer Pig Burst From the Spirits of a Chinese Farmer
The local media report that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him at the market place in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified as “Yuan” was found near a pig in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou Province, the man's artery was broken and he was on top of the blood, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pig herder prepares to vaccinate pigs in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs in the market place.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door of the nearby pigeon open.
In the pig, he said he had seen a large boar with a mouth in the blood.
According to the news, a criminal investigation confirmed a 250-pound boar from a broken farmer.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named “Wu” said that “my cousin’s feet were bloody and bruised.”
The surveillance camera shows the cousin coming to the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40am.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told Evening News that the pig was locked behind locks so that it wouldn’t harm the other police when collecting evidence at the venue.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reported on the compensations for the death.
Pigs are known to attack people before, although it is rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts, receiving serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the wife managed to hurried the animal away.
An Oregon farmer had to eat his pigs in 2012 and after the event, a farmer living in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that although pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a “trigger”.
They are just playful.
They are like toddlers, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
You just have to respect them appropriately,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's relics bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
The hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of the North Coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods to North Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 meters per second, i.e. first-class hurricane, on Sunday five in the east coast time, and it was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure over the calm sea, heading east towards the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa arrives on the Californian peninsula as a Monday tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture north towards the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimetres of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisture, which interacts with the approaching low pressure, will form large rain areas to south-west in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of 25-100 millimetres causes dangerous heavy rainfall and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes precipitation of 50-75 millimetres per hour in certain fallout areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
In certain areas, in lunch and especially in Arizona, it is expected to rain up to 50-100 millimetres.
Heavy rainfall is possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
When tropical rain threatens, it is strongly recommended to avoid going into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers and thunderstorms cause local wind gusts and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Over 10 millimetres of precipitation are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainfall in the area of the rainy season.
The scattered tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday until the rains expand on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain spreads to Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts all Wednesday.
In October, the United States can see strong fluctuations throughout the temperatures as the arctic region cools down, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes high temperature fluctuations at short distances.
In the middle of the United States, you can see an excellent example of major temperature differences on Sunday.
There is almost a temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, as well as Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
The lingering heat of the summer is once again trying to intensify and expand in the coming days.
The beginning of October is widely expected to be warm in the middle and eastern parts of the United States, at a temperature of +26 degrees from the south to the north-eastern plains.
In New York, the temperature can hurt on Tuesday to +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, in the east of the United States, there are good opportunities for higher temperatures than average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched a broadcast on Tuesday, broadcast by six television channels, in which Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, accusing him of a sexual crime in the 1980s, gave an intriguing testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as the television companies interrupted their broadcast at the last minute, according to which the FBI conducts a week-long investigation of the accusations on the basis of an agreement by Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Committee that he was 100% sure that the intoxicated Kavanaugh slammed him and tried to undress his clothes at high school parties.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional witness statement in which he said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than the 20.4 million announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures for other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often finds it difficult to measure the viewers who are watching in the offices.
Something about proportions says that the reading corresponds to the number of viewers in the American football playoff game or the Oscar gala.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers from all television companies was at Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
After hearing, interest was still high.
Flake was at the center of the Friday drama.
CNN’s and CBS’s cameras depicted how the protesters’ shouts brought him to the elevator on the way to the hearing of the Justice Committee on Friday.
CNN showed straight how he stood in a minute shop looking down as the ringings flew.
”I’m standing right in front of you,” a woman said.
Do you think he will tell the people of truth?
You have power when so many women are powerless,” he was told.
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and added before the elevator doors were closed that he would have more to tell after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks were sent directly when the Committee of Justice began to vote for the vote of the Senate Plenary on the introduction of the appointment of Kavanaugh.
However, Flake said that he was only acting in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the coming week, as demanded by the minority democrats.
Flake was convinced by his conversations with his friend, democratician Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other Senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI study of the charges against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit policy
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people who criticise her EU withdrawal plans for politics that threatens the UK’s future and national interest in the Sunday Times interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
Another interview was published next to May’s interview on the front page of the newspaper, where his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May’s so-called Chequers plan, and Johnson calls for a proposal that Britain and the EU should charge each other’s import duties ‘insanely’.
Wayde Sims shooting: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of a LSU player's death
The police have arrested a person as a suspect in the LSU for shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old who played basketball.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and delivered to prison, and according to Baton Rouge's police department, he is accused of second-degree murder.
The authorities published a video of Sims’ and Simpson’s interim report, in which the police report that Sims lost his glasses.
The police found glasses at the scene and told them that they had found Simpson’s DNA, says WAFB.
The police report that Simpson granted Wayde in question.
According to Advocate, his deposit was $350 000.
On Friday, a researcher at the East Baton Rouge municipality published a preliminary report stating that the cause of the death was a firing wound in the neck.
The Agency would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Stormtrooper Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the territory for assisting the investigation leading to detention.
Joe Alleva, Director of Exercise at LSU, thanked law enforcement authorities for their ‘extract and justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father played basketball on the LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 record balls in the game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that on Friday morning he was “horrible” and “still” of Wayde’s death.
You’re always afraid of something like this,” Wayde said.
Volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
The ash erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Centre called for citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater’s activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash discharges were registered during the day.
The centre registers thunder and vibrations several times.
On social media, images were published, in which cars were covered with a thin ash layer in residential areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed 72 kilometres of volcanic activity south-west of the capital since Mexico was shaken by the earthquake of 7.1 magnitude in September 2017.
Known as “Don Goyo”, the volcano has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists bring together before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in a confrontation between profitable protesters and the riot police, with thousands participating in competing protests on the first anniversary of the referendum.
The police arrested a group of masked adherents of independence, who threw the police on eggs and powder paint, which formed dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled by tourists.
During the day, more skirmishes broke out when the police used their batons to control the huts.
The clashes between the supporters of independence and groups of Unionists continued for several hours, while the former shouted “no forgetting, no forgiveness,” and the latter “live Spain.”
The local press says that fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries received in demonstrations.
The excitement is still on the surface in a profitable area a year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid declare illegal, but which is celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence with a clear majority, although participation was low when the opposition boycotted.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
On Friday, supportive groups stayed outside to prevent a demonstration that supported the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it had to follow another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the Separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about the independence of Catalonia.
Last year we experienced one of the best moments in our lives.”
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we are stuck in place,” he says.
Despite the vital victory in the regional elections last December, the pace of the political parties that are profitable for Catalan independence has declined this year, and many of the most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or arrested for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described the police as a worthwhile demonstration on his phone, says that politicians on both sides have incited the dispute.
The situation is tightening all the time,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders in investigative detention since the last nine years, announced his participation in next year’s European Parliament elections.
Becoming a European candidate is the best way to condemn the erosion and oppression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested for a car crashed into the house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was told that the house was repeatedly bumped into Londonderry.
The events progressed in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 British time.
Criminal commissioner Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, you could also shoot with a crossbow.
Livingston defeats Rangers with 1-0 Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston secured victory
The runner-up Livingston was astonished by Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 matches as the Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally enough to win when Gary Holt's team went to the second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew was left without the first guest win of the season in Premiership, and the next day it will be faced with Series Director Hearts, who is eight points above.
Rangers still encounters Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his undisputed streak in a series of already six games, and head coach Holt has not lost any time since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston wasted places against a visitor suffering from a blade deficiency
Holt's team should have been leading long before they scored after giving Rangers some serious difficulties in their straightness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, followed by Alan Lithgow slipping in front of the goal into Craig Halkett's butt feeding, but steered past the ball.
The hosts gave up ball control to Rangers with favor because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
An important goal came just this way.
Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
Rangers had kept the ball by then, but found the home team's defense to keep, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly wasn't able to try much.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's company, and Lithgow steered the ball past one of Livingston's special situations.
In addition to continuously cleaning up the rainy concentrations in Livingston's penalty area, two situations were unnecessarily subjected to a penalty kick - after Halkett's tackling the replacement Glenn Middleton and a hand-held ball.
Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC in Scottish Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent to each player, continuing through the upswings.
The team’s way of playing and the crew have hardly changed to get back to the highest league level. However, Holtti must be recognized for the way he has strengthened the team after reaching the team.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was staggering in leading a well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worral on his toes for the entire match.
However, Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has from time to time performed really well under Gerrard, but now stayed far from his requirement level.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open the home team’s defense only once, which should serve as a wake-up call to Rangers, who is the central caste.
Erdogan received a variable reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when the Turkish and German leaders met with breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, the purpose of the trip is to correct the relations of NATO allies.
There have been disagreements about human rights and freedom of the press as well as about Turkey’s EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented 25 000-headed supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but still close to a lot of supporters to look at the president.
Hundreds of Erdogan protesters - many of whom were Kurdish - also brought their voices to be heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competing demonstrations reflect the distribution of opinions, and some of the Germans greet him as a hero while others defy him as a sovereign.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
The cyclist died when he came across a car in London.
The accident occurred about a dozen local times in the south-west of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is lively traffic.
The car driver stopped and the medical staff came to help the victim, but the man died at the scene of the event.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about one and a half kilometers from the accident site on Saturday.
The city police report that they are trying to identify a man and inform his family members.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been directed elsewhere, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Unrest
The prison officials report that the six prison guards were injured by the high classification of men in the unrest of prison.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 on Sunday British time and continues.
Tornado Special Police have been brought to the scene to calm down the unrest, behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Minor face injuries from the police were treated at the scene.
One in prison spokesman said: “HMP Long Lartin has been sent to a specially trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that responsible people are taken into the police’s care and they may have to spend longer behind the bars.”
HMP Long Lartin prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reported to have received hospital care in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, in October, riot police were alerted to prison due to serious unrest in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings a threat of heavy rainfall to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drought areas can benefit)
In Arizona, tropical low pressures rarely occur, but that’s exactly what happens at the beginning of next week, when the remains of Hurricane Rosa pass over the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rain floods.
The national weather service has already issued a warning for heavy rain floods during Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona to Southern and Eastern Nevada, Southeastern Kaifornian and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to proceed directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving on Monday in the form of rain.
Phoenix’s national weather service pointed out in its tweet that only “the only ten tropical storms have maintained the state of tropical storm or low pressure at 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still a hurricane at 65 kilometres from the Arizona border.”
The latest modelling of the National Hurricane Center predicts precipitation of 50-100 millimetres, and in some places it can rain up to 150 millimetres on the Mogollin ridge in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including the central rocky mountains and Great Basin, 25-50 milliliters are likely to be reached, with a total rainfall of up to 100 millimetres.
Rosa rains can also be a blessing in a drought-tested area if there is no risk of heavy rain floods.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some precipitation can be beneficial, as severe droughts have been suffered in the south lunch.
According to the US DRY agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa takes her route first to land on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa’s location is 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, which is still hurricane’s strong wind speed at 135 kilometres per hour and moves north at 20 kilometres per hour.
The storm loses its strength when it comes to cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a strong tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico rains can be harsh and pose a significant flood risk.
From the California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, 75-150 millimetres are expected, and up to 250 millimetres is possible,” says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving on the Arizona border as a tropical low-pressure morning hours of Tuesday, from where she continues through Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday late night..
The biggest risks of Rosa or its remains are associated with very heavy rainfall on the Californian Peninsula, the Northwest Sonora and the Southwest Desert of the United States,” says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Detention attempts

Trump says "indignation and malice" of Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party
The voice on behalf of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and shameful methods of the democratic party,” Trump said in a meeting at Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was suffering from the “indignation and malice” of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh witnessed the Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally forbade Christine Blasey Ford's indictment for sexual harassment that would have happened decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also proved his accusation for hearing.
On Saturday the President said that “the Americans saw the excellence, character and courage of Kavanaugh” that day.
The vote in favour of confirming Kavanaugh’s appointment is a voice to one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time, with excellent merits in public service,” he said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when speaking of the importance of Republican voting in the interim elections.
We are five weeks from the most important elections in our lifetime.
Not just campaigns, but campaigns to the full,” he said.
That’s why I’m going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats were responsible for ‘resistance and prevention’.
The older assistant of the Republican Party leadership told CNN that the first important vote of Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to be held no later than Friday.
Hundreds of dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, the number of death victims is expected to rise
On Saturday, the authorities reported at least 384 dead major earthquakes and tsunami strikes on Sulawesi Island in Indonesia, and many wiped along the giant waves that hit the shores.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered at the festival, which took place on the shores of the city of Palu, when waves of up to six metres hit the beach at dusk, and many washed away as the waves destroyed everything.
Tsunami was caused by 7.5 magnitude-strong earthquakes.
When the threat of tsunami appeared yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately run away from it and they were left victims,” says Purwo Nugroho in Jakarta, a spokesman for Indonesia’s major accident relief agency, BNPB.
Tsunami didn’t come alone, it pulled along cars, tree trunks, houses and struck all over the country,” says Nugroho, adding that Tsunami reached an open sea speed of 800 kilometres per hour before hitting the coast.
Some people survived tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the Finnish Catastrophe Agency show several destroyed houses and shops, warped and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The afterquakes continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology BPPT issued an opinion that the energy released in the Friday's massive earthquake corresponded to about 200 atomic bombs, which were dropped into Hiroshima in the Second World War.
It says that the terrain of the city at the end of a long and narrow bay could inflate tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as “wide” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He told some of the bodies of the victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death victims and that the damage could be greater than the Palus 300 kilometers on the north coast, in the area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the quake.
Communication connections “are completely different, and Donggala has not received any information,” says Nugroho.
According to the Red Cross statement, more than 300 000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,” he said.
The agency was criticised extensively on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami struck the return, although the authorities said that the waves had received a warning.
In a social media shared amateur video, a man on the upper floors of the building exclaims intense warnings of approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Only minutes later, the beach is hit by a water wall that takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
The authorities say that the army has started to send help from Jakarta and other cities with transport machines, but evacuated still urgently need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport has only been reopened for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The sacrifice of Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
The situation is really bad.
The staff at World Vision Donggala have been able to secure their stay in the city of Palu, where they have been accommodated in tented canopy in the courtyard of the office, and on their way they passed the stage of destruction, says Doseba.
They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is really bad.
While the relief groups began their unconsolidated mission, some complained that foreign relief workers were prevented from travelling to return.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staff can only start flowing after the accident area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
It’s still a provincial disaster,” says Aulia Arriani, Indonesian Red Cross spokesman.
As long as the government says, “OK, this is a national disaster,” we can start international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made.”
When the other night fell over Palu after a Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the lost were inflicting hope that their loved ones’ miracles would be different from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was lifted out of the drain.
On Sunday the rescue workers released a woman who had been in the ruins two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national team, had coached two missing hangovers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
Roa Roa Hotel was also trapped by his students, says Mandagi.
As a senior member of the association, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Gendon says he has desperately tried to reach Palu’s competitors with WhatsApp messages after the news of Roa Roa Hotel’s collapse spread among the hangout community.
However, only one grey sign appeared after the messages he sent, instead of two blue ones.
It means not having messages delivered,” he says.
Thieves took $26 750 in conjunction with automat replenishment in Newport on the Width
On Friday morning, the thieves took $26 750 from the Brink’s security officer when he was supplementing the ATM at Newport on the Leve, as explained in a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying and supplementing the ATM in the entertainment center, Dennis McCarthy, who is looking for a car, says in a press release.
When Brink’s employee’s attention was elsewhere, “your men” ran behind him, stealing a money bag for delivery.
According to the press release, eyewitnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Persons who have information about their identity are requested to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name to Ye.
When she announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: “a character that used to be known as Kanye West”.
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for a while, and she also used it as the title of her eighth album released in June.
A change ahead of her upcoming performance in Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the program, cancelled his participation for “emotional reasons”.
West has previously told him that the word also has a religious meaning in addition to being an abbreviation for his professional name.
While discussing the name of the album earlier this year with radio presenter Big Boy, West said, “to believe that “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is “you”.
So I’m you, we, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form Ye - which only embodies the goodness, evil, confusion in us, everything.
The album is mainly a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced the favor of Love and Brother Love.
Also, the previous partner of West, JAY-Z, has occasionally removed and returned the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico AMLO promises not to use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised that he would never use military force against civilians, and the declaration came as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the retaliation of students.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that he would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.
Gun troops fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during a time when leftist student movements were instilling in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly financial aid and opening more free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and training opportunities would drive young people to criminal gangs.
United States should double AI research funding
The US should double its AI research funding as China intensifies its industry activities, saying Kai-Fu Lee, a finance and AI professional working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The opinion was preceded by communications concerning the AI of different parts of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China introduced its plans last year: it aims to become a leading AI developer by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start when other countries are so much behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” says Lee.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be done in the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee’s book “The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China’s most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the highest ranked Othello player in the United States, later serving in Microsoft Research’s management positions and as director of Google’s Chinese operations.
Lee recognized the US government’s previous technology contests, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers have worked hard to get public assistance.
Academic influencers are not taking China, but big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its AI efforts.
I think those who have completed an AI PhD should automatically issue green cards,” he said.
China Government next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together industrial and academic world partners, and the White House has also announced the formation of an AI special committee.
Also DARPA announced this month for a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
NSF invests more than $100 million in AI research annually.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to establish a national security commission for artificial intelligence has not progressed to months.
Macedonians in referendum to change the country's name
In a Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would resolve a dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country’s efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO for decades.
Greece, with the name Macedonia, believes that the name of the neighbor to the north is essentially an area in which it belongs and has therefore objected to its access to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new proposal for a name, but the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he is not going to vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the voting activity reaches the required limit of 50% in order for the result to be legitimate.
The question on the voting ticket was: “Are you on the NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece”.
Name change advocates like Prime Minister Zora Zaev make sense that the price should be paid so that Macedonia, who has risen from the collapse of Yugoslavia, could aim to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
Today I came to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
The change in name requires a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Committee, no irregularities had been reported by 13 o’clock.
However, the voting activity was only 16, compared to 34 per cent in the previous 2016 elections, when in the end 66 per cent of the persons entitled to vote gave their vote.
I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital city.
On 30 September 2018, Zorica, Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko voted in the vote on the Macedonian name change in Strumica, Macedonia.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small pallet and laid chairs in front of the tents pitched by boycotting people in front of the Skopje Parliament.
We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads upright and not through the kitchen door,” said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to another, such as China and Russia as part of the integration into the euro area.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
I believe that a large majority vote in favour of a name change because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” said Zaev, after giving his voice.
He said the “yes” voice was “to make our future.”
The opinion poll published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute on Monday referred to the 30-43% voting activity in the referendum – that is, the activity required below.
In another survey commissioned by Macedonia’s Telma TV, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote for the yes option.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voting activity must exceed 50 per cent in one voice.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback to the Western government after its rise in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City defeated the entire Brighton defense with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his 65-minute goal look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentinian top player received input from the midfield.
He found an empty space in the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left several others behind at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English toe used its first touch inside the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed Brighton-guard Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot to the right corner.
City Manager Pep Guardiola told the journalists that “Aguero has problems with his feet”.
We talked about playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal in that time.”
However, Sterling had already given the skies an advantage in the Premier League battle.
The goal was scored in 29 minutes.
In the situation, Aguero got a ball in the deep Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass through to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took a few touches before sending the ball to the back post towards Sterling.
The celestial blue attacker poked the ball into the net just before the end line.
City will face Hoffenheim Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a joyous player in a match against Rockies
Nationals is out of the playoff battle, so why insist on a start-up lineup?
However, there’s always one competitive Scherzer hopes to take control of the round in a Sunday match against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a playoff seam, they will have one win difference to Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western series.
Rockies scored at least a wild card with their 5-2 wins from the Nationals on Friday night, but still aim for their first division win.
Even though we don’t have a stake, we can rise to the feeding hill, knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team here in Denver creates the most demanding competitive setup I have encountered this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take on the challenge?”
Nationals has not yet published its start-up for Sundays, but according to the information, they are inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
On Thursday, Scherzer threw a training session, playing his 34th game at the start and fed on Sunday with his normal rest.
The right-handed player of Washington has a win/loss ratio of 18-7 this season, with an ERA of 2.53 and has burned the batter's nest 300 times, with an innings of 220 2/3.
Trump Campaigns in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his high court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of Republican voting in the interim elections.
All our achievements will be in the game in November.
We are five weeks from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of really big--not just campaigns, but campaigns to the fullest, and that’s why I roll everywhere to fight for excellent candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to return to the power by any means; you can see their malice and malice.
They don’t choose who they harm or who they need to roll to power, they want it, power and power, but we don’t give it to them.”
He said the Democrats took over the task of “opposition and blocking”.
And it has been visible in the last four days,” he said, calling the democrats “hate and wicked and malicious and false.”
As he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-influenced democratician in the Senate Justice Committee, the audience responded with loud booms.
Do you remember his answer?
Are you leaking the document?
Eh, eh, what.
Well, oh no, I'm expecting a little - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion
I wasn’t really surprised when my local party Momentum activists endorsed a distrust sentence against me.
After all, I’m only the latest Labour representative of the queue, to whom I’m not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in the same way just because she resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, the distrust was a criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics, of which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Meeting said on Friday that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the eight years that I have been a local representative of Labour, the party council Friday sizes have been exactly that.
Now, not many meetings follow that tone of voice, and “more friendly and gentler” politics have long been forgotten if it even started.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates dissenting opinions, and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is suitable for the party management or not.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I had thought I was sharing a similar political view began to look forward to a full translation and statements that I would never have agreed to, whether national security or the EU internal market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a roar of insults on social media that requires the reversal of my choice, the rejection of the Centralist politics and I get to hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And it’s not just my own experience.
I really know that I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I’ve received are political.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist abuse every day, and never shake.
The normalization of abuse is one of the most disruptive features of this era’s policy.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour Party adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and with every distrust or choice rule change, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years, I have been advised to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that “everything would go well”.
But that’s not the reason why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of failure to attend Thatcher’s unified school, I have sought to promote better public services for those who need them the most.
I have never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could be surprised at my views or my disagreements with the current management.
For those who advocated the initiative last Friday, I want to say that as the state progresses towards Brexit, which hampers households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on reliance on the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honor, and the threat of separation or the promotion of political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr at the top of the block
Two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undeniably earned a win in the entertaining Tennent ́s Premiership.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten that has not lost any matches.
A great defense and a more successful taking of risks was ultimately what supported them, and the coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied for a reason.
”We have been challenged in our matches and still we are invincible, so I can be satisfied,” he says.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie says, “All honor to Ayr, they took risks better than we.”
Ayr took the lead for 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, handed over to Warriors, enabled Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored a goal.
Climo increased Ayr’s management with a penalty goal, and just before halfway he scored and succeeded in the conversion kick, increasing Ayr’s management to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second run well with Patrick Anderson's goal, whose conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and taken out of the field, and as the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with Stafford McDowall's goal, with which Climo succeeded in the conversion kick.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine scored a goal that the conversion kick failed.
The home team replied, however, when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to tackle the globeless Climo, and Macpherson scored a goal at the end of Ayr's maul, which left the side throw.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's kick and brought Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game series star starts in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company and thus starts working in the restaurant industry as well.
A 56-year-old actress plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC program, which she scripts with her comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season is the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the public register information, he has been identified as a leader in the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the Scottish Sun magazine's source hinted that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
The sea belongs to us”: the landlocked Bolivia tries to regain contact with the Pacific Ocean by law
Sailors patrol outside the naval base in La Paz.
Sea blue flag flies in the flagpoles of public buildings.
Fleet bases from Titicaca to Amazon are frowned with a slogan: “Justly the sea belongs to us.
It is our responsibility to get it back.”
Inland Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 1800s is still strong – as is the longing to sail in the Pacific Ocean once again.
Hope is at its highest for decades when Bolivia waits for the International Court’s decision on 1 October after five years of reflection.
Bolivia has a strong belief in progress, a sense of solidarity and serenity, and of course a positive attitude towards the final solution,” said Roberto Calzad, diplomat from Bolivia.
Several Bolivians around the country hopefully follow the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that in The Hague – at the end of decades of intermittent debate – Bolivia will take the view that Chile is obliged to grant independent access to the sea in Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic president Evo Morales, who will face the re-election of the controversial battle next year, will have a lot in the game in the next Monday’s policy.
The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close,” he assured towards the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in the interest of Bolivia, and even if it decided, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch-based UN institution has no power to dispense the territories of Chile, and ICJ has also announced that it will not impose an outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that ICJ’s decision is issued only six months after the last statement suggests that the case “is not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia’s intentions.
The current Bolivian government has captured the question of sea connection,” said Zárate.
The rhetoric challenging the Morales dispute has suppressed the rest of the Chileans’ goodwill,” he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss at some point, but then it will be very difficult to organise negotiations.
No other embassy has been in either country since 1962.
The former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court decision would have been exceptionally fast.
Monday gives Bolivia a “extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end the disputes that have lasted for 139 years with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzad also argues that Morales, one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, would have used the maritime issue as a political support.
Bolivia will never give up its right to contact the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The decision is an opportunity to understand that it’s time for us to move forward from the past.”
North Korea announced that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States
North Korea will not give up their nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said Ri Yong Ho, the Foreign Minister of North Korea.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the heads of state at the Singapore summit.
Rin's statement came just before the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is re-starting with the nuclear weapons of dead-end diplomacy, only three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said that it is a “fary dream” to believe that the extended sanctions and the US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war would bring North Korea to their knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant measures to promote disarmament, Washington is on guard in accepting the declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to give up the arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has gained a lot of doubt.
Pompeo is about to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows present the latest collection of large headdresses, which are also soon on your street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you do not have to continue searching.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed their SS19 collection of special oversized headwear that dazzled the style districts of Paris' fashion weeks.
Very impractical headwear took Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino's most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide trim that almost completely covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon with jewelry stones, a wizard hat and even a pineapple – but they aren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of unusual masks – just right before Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than top fashion.
One creation with snorkel and mask resembled more diving gear, and the other resembled the melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand on large-scale fashion, you got lucky.
The followers of fashion predict that huge scarves are appearing in the street scene.
Exaggerated-sized hats closely follow the “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a half-metre brim that has been seen on everyone from Rihanta to Emily Ratajkowski.
On social media, the cult reputation of an impractical hat also propelled another large creation into fashion shows – a beach bag made of straw that is almost as large as the model that carries it.
The raffia bag with white leather hand straps, lined with a burnt orange reed decoration, was the most striking creation of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large-scale hats and beach bags on the street next summer – designers have made such a big impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories.”
John Edward: language skills are a key skill for global citizens
The learning outcomes of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has also continued in 2018 as a result of good test results, with individual and communal success in sports, art, music and other communal projects.
These schools, which are more than 30 000 students in different parts of Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council (SCIS) in order to provide a high-quality service to their students and their parents.
The private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen careers, further education and higher education, as well as for global citizenship.
As a professional in the field of education, who can design and implement tailored study content, we have noticed the position of languages as a popular and desired subject in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his or her own language, the message will go to his or her heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to establish relationships with people from other countries.
With this year’s latest test results, we find that the languages are at the top of the list for passing through percentage among private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest rating of A.
The data were collected from 74 SCIS schools, and it was found that students who received the highest grade of A, 72% studied Chinese Mandarin, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63 percent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At the moment, languages are free-choice substances, but they are considered to be the same value as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the study programme of private schools and elsewhere.
Based on a survey commissioned by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17 per cent of the situations where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by lack of language skills.
Therefore, the development of language skills is even more necessary for the promotion of future career development for young people.
The more language skills required for possible jobs, the more essential these skills are in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he or she will have an advantage in the future in this lifelong skill, regardless of what career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner to automatically put the language-speaking person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, 75% of more than 4,000 UK adults are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, and French was the only language to have a double-digit number of 15%.
Because of this, investing in teaching languages is now important for today’s children.
Especially the language skills of developing states give children a better chance of finding a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are presumably important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Despite your child’s interests, there are always several language options in private schools, taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
In this period, it cannot be denied that international business environment languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be seen as “international communication skills”.
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, versatility and a high level of Scotland for young people.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron makes debut on Sunday in San Diego
LeBron James’ first appearance in the Los Angeles Lakers lineup is soon over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he actually plays, remains to be seen.
It will be more than one, and less than 48” said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for the incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the rehearsal sessions earlier this week, was asked about his plans for a pre-delivery six game.
At this point in my career, I no longer need pre-matches to prepare,” he said.
Time of the Trump West Virginia campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start the series of election campaigns today at Wheeling in West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five electoral events planned for next week, including compassionate destinations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits his election in order to fill the free seat of the Supreme Court judge, Trump aims to increase support for the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing the majority in the November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s West Virginia Wheeling event starts at 19 o’clock on Saturday 29.9.2018.
You can watch the Trump West Virginia promotion online as a live streaming via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump takes a stand on the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, the Judge-Rapporteur of the Supreme Court of this week, who became accusations of sexual harassment that have delayed the Senate’s confirmation vote as much as a week when the FBI examined the charges.
But the primary goal for the series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tight November elections.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign was commented on these five events of the week to “awaken volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
Managing Congress is so important for his purpose that the President is willing to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign period,” said Reuters, an anonymous representative of the Trump campaign.
Today’s venue is Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there are even fans from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month in West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who has been left behind in opinion surveys.
From the point of view of Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion surveys,” said state scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows will to fight to keep hope ahead of Sunday solo games
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-reinforcing power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and even more in tournaments like this.
Where is this success force at the moment?
They had a six-point leadership position that narrowed to four, so we’re taking this success as a nugget,” said Jordan Spieth, walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points above and 12 in play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel a little wind on the sails and a lot of encouragement, such as the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play all day together and score three points for four.
Spieth has been superior from brick to green, leading by example.
The hoarse throats of the victorious feast were intensified as he progressed as he succeeded in a critical putt to level the match at four, when he and Thomas were two points behind two holes.
Putt, with which they won the 15th match followed a similar shout, which gave the impression that he believes that the team in the United States has not yet lost.
”You have to focus really well and only look after your own match,” Spieth said.
That’s the only thing these players now have left.
18 holes to make an effect.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe’s special yet sweet duo has won four out of four flawlessly.
Moliwood” was the only duo who didn’t do any bogi on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogi on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That tour, and the way they give and get energy from this raucous crowd, confirms that they are the pre-favorites of Sunday, and when the sun goes down in Le Golf National, the other most popular player in Europe could not be the Fleetwood and Molinari.
Prefer both at the same time with different holes.
However, the talks about Europe’s success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Alex Noren with the paired Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-game.
One bog and two double bogs on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish so deep into the pit that they were not even near to survive there.
However, on Sunday no one should help you out of the pit.
The four-ball and the four-player are fascinating to follow closely from the point of view of the couple’s cooperation: what kind of advice they give or not, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team until now and taken a prominent leadership position before the last day, but this four-player showed that the US team has a will to fight, even though it has been suspected, in particular in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 management before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will be in good lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup after they took a Saturday in four-balls and four-players 10-6 leading positions in the US.
The brilliant two Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the triumph of the two winning Tiger Woods, and scored four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who struggled hard to keep a win in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the weakly played U.S. team in the morning foursome, taking the match to the situation of 3-1.
The United States were a tougher opponent in four-players, winning two matches, but they couldn’t narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's half needed eight points from Sunday's 12 doubles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row; he and Molinari, also referred to as “Molliwood”, were the second two in the history of the Ryder Cup, who has won four points in the first four games after the sensational weekend.
After crushing Wood and Patrick Reed in four balls, they finished the superiorly discouraged Wood and the American beginner Bryson Dechameau even more vigorously 5-4.
The Woods, which barely survived through two matches on Saturday, was at times very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-player, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested on the four-balls of the morning, but returned with Henrik Stenson to the four-player, but lost to 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeppa, who are ranking first and third.
Europe did not receive everything in the way it wanted this fresh and pleasant day to lunch in Paris.
Triple title winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the US with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 for Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball, and later for 4-3 for Poulter and Rory McIlroy after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has risen from a four-point pursuit to levels at the start of the doubles, although on the Furyk side, the draw is also enough to keep the win.
However, after two days the second best can be that the Sunday counterattack has been overrequested.
North Korea “not in any way” undresses itself without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the UN on Saturday that continuing sanctions only increased distrust in the United States, and in these circumstances there is no possibility of the North Korea abandoning its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant good-natured measures” over the past year, such as the end of nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the test site of nuclear tests and promised that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
However, we haven’t seen a similar gesture from the United States,” he said.
Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so under such circumstances it is not possible to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Although Ri reiterated the familiar appeal that Washington did not accept a step-by-step abandonment of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded for every mid-term issue, his statement is however significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament is not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. President and President of North Korea summit in Singapore on 12.6. In the statement, Kim assured “the removal of the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons” and Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
The North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the ease of strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The United States requires “nuclear disarmament first” and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals with a forced force – even against the “pronouncement of peace” ”, Ri said.
The notion that sanctions would bring us to our knees is the hope of the indifferent.
But the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, however, which Trump himself highlighted to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings with Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea, over the past five months, and added: “If the party requiring disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such a dead end.”
Nevertheless, Rin’s tone of voice was significantly different from last year when he told at the UN General Assembly that orienting missiles towards the U.S. continents was inevitable after “bad president” Trump called Kim a “missile man with suicide intentions.”
Last year, Trump threatened “to completely destroy” North Korea, but this year, Trump praised Kim for his courage to approach the abandonment of weapons, but stressed that there is still a lot of work left and the sanctions must remain until North Korea abandons nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no temporal deadline: “If it takes two years, three or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia proposed that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the advances already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that “The reinforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be strong and without fail until we prove a full, final and confirmed abandonment of nuclear weapons.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions towards North Korea since 2006, with the aim of overthrowing Pyongyang’s financial channels for ballistic and nuclear missile production.
Pompeo met the North Korean Rin in connection with the UN General Assembly and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has been visiting North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was not smooth.
As he left Pyongyang, he described progress, but North Korea condemned Pompeo’s “gangsteric demands” only a few hours later.
North Korea committed to the closure of the missile base and nuclear facility with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States carries out ‘equivalent measures’.
According to Pompeo, Kim means “equivalent measures” security guarantees, which Trump committed to at the meeting in Singapore, and the move towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate rest instructional course
This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University participate in a course aimed at increasing students’ rest.The course is a countermeasure to the university’s booming macho culture, where students weigh a long night with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, the students of the world’s best university are often quite ignorant about the basics of their own well-being.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of the Harvard University Medical Faculty, who works with sleep research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, believes that the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after lectureing on the impact of a lack of sleep on learning.
After the lecture, a young woman came to my speech and said, ‘Why do I only hear about it now, in my last year of study?’
No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I thought was surprising,” he explained in an interview with Telegraph.
The course, organised for the first time this year, guides students on how proper sleep habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor and Deputy Director of Health Services at Harvard Medical Faculty, says that the university had completed the course after hearing how students had suffered from serious sleep deficits during the study week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of a dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thus getting information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deficit on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants will be told how a long-term sleep deficit can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
We know that this has no immediate impact on student behavior.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these things just as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking,” Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, the night-long study marathons are still a source of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students made the sleep deficit a growing problem.
Getting enough and high-quality sleep should be against the students’ ‘secret weapon’ stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even weight gain, because the lack of sleep in the brain causes a condition similar to starvation, which is why man is constantly hungry’, the professor points out.
Raymond So, a California 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course after he had attended one of his first courses in Harvard last year.
She says that the course opened her eyes and gave an impetus to all the students on the campus to organize the course.
She hopes that all doctoral students could complete a similar study module before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends setting the alarm clock for students to remind not only of bedtime in the morning waking up, but also to keep in mind the adverse effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on the circadian rhythm, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot took victory from Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and Rangers once again experienced a new defeated day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox’s players were looking for their first win since February 4-1 against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team won this time, and Gerrard only experienced his second loss during his 18 game manager career. Rangers was eight points away from the current Premier League leader Hearts.
Menga shot the ball to the goal seven minutes before half-time, and with the fallen will of Rangers, the situation was no longer smoothed.
Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game, however, Livingston has climbed to third place, with Hibernia only above the goal difference.
Rangers may have other problems ahead of them, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object thrown from the guest stand hit the head, and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up where the team had defeated Ayr and progressed to the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 line-up, where the team took a point from Hearts last week, and the same strategy again resulted when a well-built line-up succeeded in chastising the opponent at almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better to use the situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to score for two minutes when the first Menga pass gave Scott Pittman a free path to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Kaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halket, but another defender Alan Lithgow only managed to hit the rear post wide.
Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but the third air in the game no longer had confidence.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when, at fifteen minutes, he and Steven Lawless had collided, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly effortlessly combated Lassana Coulibaly's butt and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation wasn't just due to the team's hard work.
Rangers could still do nothing for Jacobs’ long feeding tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who coldly escorted the ball to Menga for easy paint.
During the changeover period, Gerrard decided to switch to Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent in the field. The change affected the game almost immediately as Kent created a suitable gap for Morelos, but the attack broke Kelly's impressively fast defense.
Livingston put his players to play his own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued to feed each other long.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead at the last moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow reached his positions in the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came from Rangers' exchange, also called for a penalty kick after he had teamed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: Geigermeter Inventor
The following page of our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geigometer.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the central concept of pop culture, for example, well-suited for the 1950 film “Coronado watches”, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans represent scientists who are quite fond of cattle shepherds:
Man: “What is that miracle?”
Rogers: “It is a geiger meter that is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you place the headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation in minerals.”
Evans: “Look, it’s really going to be!”
Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, an invention that bears his name still lives.
New cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroying them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and changed in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the proteins typical of many cancers
The test has given promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, the cancer cells of patients with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months of being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and altered in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of many cancers, and the modified cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA describes the method: “It is a very promising vaccine based on our results.”
HER2 “controls the growth of several types of cancer,” Professor Berzofsky explains, “these include breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colon cancers.”
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West fell into the teeth of critics after praising Trump in Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The performance did not go as planned
Kanye West was boosted by the Saturday Night Live entertainment program after praised by President Donald Trump and announced his intention to be president in the 2020 election.
After presenting his third night song “Ghost Town” in the Make America Great Again campaign hat of Trump, West attacked the Democrats and repeated his support to President Trump.
Often when talking to a caucasian person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he is a racist.
If racism had been a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he says.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch in which Matt Damon scorned Brett Kavanaugh for the hearing of the Senate's Legal Committee in connection with Christine Blasey Ford's assertions of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West fling wasn’t presented live, but comedian Chris Rock downloaded a fragment of it on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock's intention is to mock West on his post.
West also complained that he had been mistreated by the public because of his hat on the back of his head.
I was tempted behind the scenes.
I was told I should not go to the stage with this hat on my head.
I have been tempted!
Then they say I’m on the margin,” says West in an interview with Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see what it means to be in the margin?” and says you’re wearing a Superman cape because “then you can’t set what I’m doing, you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
According to Variety, West commentary cheered the audience up at least twice, and the show performers looked embarrassed, one of those present described the situation for the magazine as follows: “The whole studio went completely quiet.”
West was selected to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by presenting the song “I love it” as a Perrier bottle.
West is supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA organization, who praised her for her courage on Twitter: “THANKS YOU WHEN YOU DEFECTED THE ROSBAN”.
However, the conversation leader Karen Hunter tweeted that West “is just himself, which is once wonderful”.
However, I can decide not to support a person (buying his music or clothing brand or supporting his or her “art” which I consider to support and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
The same applies to us,” he added.
Before the evening, Rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name to “a person who used to be known as Kanye West”.
West is not the first artist to change their name, and here the musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later to an artist who was known before as Prince.
Belfast Restaurant Knife Prosecutor Prosecuted by a Murdered Company
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempting murder after being stabbed on Friday at a restaurant in Belfast, East.
The incident took place according to the police in the area of Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected before the Belfast court on Monday.
The prosecution is checked by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Throne Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-waving heroic role in Jon Snow’na HBO’s violent fantasy series Throne Game.
Harrington, however, has attacked the stereotype of a macho hero: according to a 31-year-old actress, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the cultural supplement of Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that “something has gone wrong” and asks about the means used to address toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Newly married to Rose Leslie, who is also part of the Star Guard of the Throne Game, she admits that she has a strong desire to intervene.
The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity in me at the moment generates strong sensations,” he says.
What has been taught to men in the years of their growth, which has led to problems that are now noticeable?”
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculine.
He continues: “what is innate and what is learned?
What do we learn on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel like they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
Young men have something really wrong.”
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of pre- or sequels to the Throne Game after the series runs out next summer, as he has, according to his own words, “made enough of battlefields and horses”.
In November, Harrington is seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells about the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best thing that the Throne Game has offered her.
I met my wife in this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and life from then on,” she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love for Jon Snow, played by Harrington, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple was inaugurated in June 2018 on the Leslie family estates in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: Number of new infections has increased by 14% in China
China has announced that the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-induced citizens has increased by 14 per cent.
According to health authorities, the virus affects more than 820 000 people in the country.
Approximately 40 000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through polluted blood transfusions.
However, according to China’s health authorities at the Yunnan province conference, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased with 100 000 cases.
HIV infections through sex are an acute issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Research estimates that 70–90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women due to the conservative values of the country.
Many of the infections are due to insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to guarantee the general availability of HIV drugs as part of the efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies information from an employee's leaked Republican Senator and blames the dissemination of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, disputed on Saturday the claims that his employee would have published personal information about three Republicans on the Wikipedia website.
A demo agent from Los Angeles assured that the claims are distributed by “extreme right” commentators and websites.
Lies, lies, and more disdainful lies,” says Waters in a statement published on Twitter.
Among the published information was the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
An unknown person published the information on Thursday from the U.S. Congress during the hearing of the Senate Committee on the charges of sexual abuse against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred shortly after three Senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that according to the Hillin newspaper, messages were published from the IP address associated with the Waters office and by a person belonging to the Waters staff.
This unjustified accusation is completely wrong and it is an absolute lie,” Water continued.
My employees, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false accusations, are not responsible for any leakage of this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely false and absolutely false.“
The Waters statement quickly became critical on the internet, and the critics also included the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
The way he denies this is very hostile,” Fleischer wrote.
It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There is no reason for defiance.
There is no reason to question the prosecutor’s motives.
The situation must be moderate and calm.“
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the criticism of the democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during the Thursday hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for the position of the Waters in the mid-term elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
Incredible if this is true,” he tweeted.
Waters stated in its opinion that it had contacted ‘appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies in response to these fraudulent accusations.
We make sure that the creators are exposed,” he continued, “and that they will be legally held accountable for any destructive and dangerous action on some or all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Underpowered Rowan Atkinson Agent Parody
It’s already a well-established tradition of searching for Brexit references from any film that’s on its head to Britain, but this doesn’t seem to be suitable for Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series that started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected with the 2011 sequel “Johnny English – Reborn”.
Can the language of the nation satire made in the cheek become the new British national export success?
Either way, Johnny English, an open-eyed, cumin-like and incompetent, has already earned his permission for the second time, and his name says, above all, that it is a comical creation aimed at a film market outside the English world.
Of course, it’s the go-to secret agent who desperately strives to breathe graceful glamour around him, but appears as a mixture of Inspector Cluseau, Mr. Bean and the unhappy one-note musician at the London Opening Concert of 2012.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mystical world man who has left pure chaos behind, and Atkinson presented him in the previously forgotten Barclaycard TV ads.
The latest show is a moment.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the blades of the rotor knock on his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy presents come out, but the humour itself seems underpowered and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ film brands such as 007 and Dangerous Mission today offer humour as part of the film’s central content.
The humor seems to be aimed at children, and the mischievous treatment of Johnny English does not seem to me as inventive and sharp-looking as the comedy of Atkinson's Mr. Bean's mute roles.
The recurring starting point each year is that the UK is worse once in trouble.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated the top secret spy network in the UK and reveals the identity of all UK agents in the field as an agent’s astonishment – an unfortunate small role performance presented by Kevin Eldon.
This is the final drop for the important and tense Prime Minister, who is already in his ears in the disgrace of politics: Emma Thompson does everything in Teresa May's parody character's skins, but the script not only provides him enough space.
When intelligence advisors notify him that all spies in the field have been exposed, someone who has already moved away from active service must be invited to the rescue.
It is of course Johnny English, who spends his retirement as a teacher of a fine school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noblest skill of espionage. The topic sparks some clever jokes; English keeps school of rock-type lessons in the secrets of intelligence.
English is rushed to the Whitehall emergency meeting, where he again meets his endless patient battle partner Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to get his rights.
Thus, the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of his majesty to confront Olga Kurylenko's fateful supercriminal Ophelia Bhuletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is about to be manipulated by the charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, who is portrayed by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve British computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough instantly turns into a farce: a pair disguised as waiters ignites a fine French restaurant on the fire and causes chaos in pursuit of the luxury yacht of Volta, a company that explores Volta’s house with virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last blockers of the creators are breaking down when coming to the final scene, but despite all the incredibleness and charm, the film still feels a bit like being made for the child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When I watch Johnny English films, I’ve already ended up thinking about the same thing: why the British film industry can’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to her talent?
British Workers’ Party denies plans for a four-day working week with five-day pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan that British people would work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
The party is said to require managers to transfer the savings generated by the AI revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend with the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of ‘suitable’ for the party’s economic programme and its plans for the tilting of politics for the benefit of the workers.
The Trade Union Central Organisation supports the transition to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
The source of the high-level working party tells the Sunday Times newspaper: “Revision of the policy has been announced before the turn of the year.
The change will not happen in an instant, but a four-day working week is a goal that is suitable for balancing the party’s approach to the benefit of employees and for the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to support the four-day shift to the working week in connection with its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the goal does not receive indivisible support in the Labour ranks.
The spokesperson of the Labour Party states: “The four-day working week is not a policy of the party, and the party does not consider such a transition.”
John McDonnell, Finance Minister of the Shadow Government, took advantage of the work conference last week to present his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to inherit power from the “faceless dictators” and the “ speculators” of nonprofits.
According to the Minister of Finance of the shadow government, the current shareholders of water companies would not receive their share in their entirety, as the government led by Labour could implement ‘decreases’ based on observed misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and to create inclusive ownership funds that would transfer 10% of private sector companies’ share capital to manage employees, according to which an individual employee would be paid a maximum of £500 per year as dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss in the 60-minute program whether FBI’s investigation on Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation into the charges against Brett Kavanaugh, the FBI judge, has delayed at least a week’s final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as judge of the Supreme Court, which also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republicans for the appointment of Kavanaugh.
In the 60-minute episode of the program to be broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the senators of the Republican Party, John Kennedy, and Lindsey Graham, if it could be possible for the FBI to find out on the basis of which they could change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
So, of course,” Kennedy said.
I said by the way to the hearing... I said I have talked with judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the accusations came out and asked him ‘ Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.“
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like heaved stone.
I’ve made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it’s bomb-proof,” he said.
Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett denied it sharply,” Graham added Christine Blasey, referring to Ford.
None of the people he named was able to confirm the issue.
It’s about 36 years old.
I can’t see what could change.“
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, Global Citizen Festival in New York is a music event with an impressive performance as its mission: to eradicate poverty from the world.
Now for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to New York’s Central Park lawns to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make it known the real goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group whose goal is to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in eradicating poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or ‘actions’, such as volunteering, sending an email to the political decision-maker, or making a call, or any other act that disseminates awareness of the project’s objectives.
But how has Global Citizen been successful, now that it is only 12 years to reach this goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clickivism’ among others – an idea that the world can change by signing an online address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announces that more than 19 million ‘actions’ made for different goals have been recorded since 2011.
According to it, these acts have encouraged political decision-makers to report commitments and principles that correspond to more than $37 billion, which have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations, based on which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have so far affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to “helping the development of children to their full potential.” The group committed to deliver $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, after the activists sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries, and global citizens like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the journals of history,” said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the public at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British government was also called on to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5 000 actions, and the government has announced a Power on Nutrition project focusing on the prevention of malnutrition of funding, reaching 5 million mothers and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the store website is: “Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?”
Global citizen’s answer: “The road becomes long and difficult and many stumbling blocks are ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as large civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.”
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman host the New York concert this year, featuring artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Ministry of the Interior, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the fleet as a “block”
According to the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner magazine, Washington may “if necessary” resort to its fleet’s assistance in preventing the spread of Russian energy in the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s activities in Syria – by the invitation of a legal government – are an excuse for the feeling of new energy markets in the region.
I believe that the [Russian] reason for the presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe,” Zinken says.
According to the office holder, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
The US has the ability to keep shipping routes open with its fleet and, if necessary, by islanding to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up in the world market,” he says.
Zinke spoke to the public at an event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that is profiled as “the horn for energy consumers” in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
The economic alternative of Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel for another,” he says, and describes Russia as “a single trick circus number”, the economy of which is based on fossil fuels.
The statements will take place in a situation where the Trump administration has sought to improve the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace the substantial amount of liquefied natural gas from Russia.
To enhance this, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, binds Berlin to the lead of Moscow.
Moscow is repeatedly focused on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transmission capacity of 110 billion cubic metres of pipeline in use, to be a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington’s opposition, and considers it to be an example of unhealthy competition.
I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier,” says Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak of Russia after meeting the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has caused a reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial umbrella association, the German Confederation of Industry, has called for the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I find it very problematic that the third state is involved in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Industrial Federation recently after meeting with German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, intends to carefully reflect on her nomination in the presidential election in 2020
On Saturday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would “consider meticulously” his position as presidential candidate after the mid-term election.
Warren confirmed that he would consider a candidate for an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
It’s time for women to move to Washington and fix our faulty regime, and this also means a woman at the headquarters of the kingdom,” he said, according to The Hill magazine.
After the sixth day of November, I will carefully consider settling as a presidential candidate.”
Warren evaluates President Donald Trump during the event by saying that “he is taking the country in the wrong direction.”
I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” he says.
Warren has appeared outright as a critic for Trump and his high court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote “I guess we need an FBI study before voting”.
However, according to the opinion poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren’s candidates should not stand for election in 2020.
According to a study conducted by Suffolk University Policy Research Institute and Boston Globe, 58% of ‘probable’ voters in Massachusetts should not stand as candidates.
32% supported the nomination.
Many of the respondents supported former Governor Deval Patrick’s nomination with a 38% share, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent democratic candidates in the discussions are, for example, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
According to the Associated Press News Agency, Biden has said that it will officially decide on its nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war trauma at Donald Trump's election
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested against Monday night and was accused of domestic violence
”What my son has to go through after returning home can well identify with other families who have to face the consequences and injuries of the PTSD that return home to our soldier,” he told the audience of Donald Trump’s election event in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called arrest ‘the current horse in the living room’ and said his son, like other war veterans, “back home a little bit changed, they return cured, they return wondering if what he and his companions in the army and air forces have done for this country’.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and Dan Bennett, a police spokesman at Wasilla, found that he was accused of domestic violence and abuse against a woman, as well as domestic violence and the handling of a weapon.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the action brought against the new asylum practice
The eighteen states and the Columbian Federal District are seeking a new policy in force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people fleeing from violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts have filed a letter entitled Friends of Justice in Washington, D.C., on Friday, to support asylum seekers who violate the policy, says NBC News.
The full name of the relevant owner has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions action, which was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He reports that his partner “and his violent boys” have abused him, and the US authorities have refused him asylum on 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, most of whom are asylum seekers in the United States, as states where gang and domestic violence are a problem that has spread to all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the 2014 decision of the Board of Appeal for Asylum Applications, according to which undocumented migrants have been able to seek asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Public Prosecutor of Columbia General, commented in his statement on Friday that the new policy “to ignore the decades of state, federal and international law”.
The federal law requires that all asylum applications be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle in the ‘friends of the right’ letter says.
Prosecutors also claim that the practice of preventing access to asylum seekers is damaging to the US economy, as newcomers are likely to become entrepreneurs and ‘bring the necessary extra labour’.
In June, General Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered referees to stay asylum from victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
The asylum is intended for persons fleeing their home country due to persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality or a certain class of society or political opinion” Sessions announced the new asylum practice in its statement of 11.6.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even serious problems – that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate survival efforts continue in Palu – the number of found death victims has already doubled
For survivors, the situation becomes even more serious.
The situation is very tight,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her feverish baby at the evacuation centre in the ruined city of Palu.
Ambulances bring a minute from a new body.
Clean water is scarce.“
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their hydrogenated goods, and try to save what is yet to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged in 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from spine and shoulder fracture, rest outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients are treated due to constant, intense afterquakes.
His eyes are filled with tears as he repeated how a furious earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn’t have time to be saved.
I was stuck between the ruins of the wall, I think,” says Harris, according to Associated Press, and says that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
I heard my wife screaming for help and then came quiet.
I don’t know what has happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador charges China for “provoking” with “propaganda announcements”
The U.S. Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of the use of the American magazine as a propaganda tool, a week after the Chinese newspaper had published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper that praises the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
Last Wednesday, President of the United States Donald Trump referred to a paid annex to the Chinese Daily in the Des Moines Register newspaper, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after blaming China for the congress elections on 6.11.
Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s attempts to get involved in the U.S. elections mean a new phase in Washington’s expanding campaign to pressure China to Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to distribute declarations to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in the ever escalating trade war, where both parties will impose duties on their turn on counterparty export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, Chinese retaliation tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump at the beginning of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China, and a long-term governor of the State of Iowa, says that Beijing has harmed the U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses, and is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China “is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press” wrote Branstad on Sunday in his statement in Des Moines Register.
By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from the prestigious free word and press tradition of the United States by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
In Beijing’s street newsstands, on the other hand, differing opinions are only limited, and the real, differing opinions that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy can’t be seen at all, because the media is strictly in the lead of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
Branstad continues by telling him that “one of the biggest Chinese newspapers did not publish an offer” by his article, but does not specify which magazine it is.
Kavanaugh-fiasco banishes female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the top names of Republicans stand behind the judge of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and defend him can, according to analysts, cause a reaction especially among female voters in the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding the case have been on big rounds, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to move forward in voting.
These things cannot be undone,” says Professor of Political Science Grant Reeher from the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday in The Hill magazine.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona) last minute's offer of FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
Women don’t forget what happened yesterday and they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” says Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and spokesman for the national reform group MoveOn, according to a newspaper published in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “the coming of November” as the Republicans ruling in the Senate’s corridors decided to proceed in the name of Kavanaugh, which took place despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reports.
Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluated,” says Stu Rothenberg, an unengaged analyst in a news site interview.
People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the insecure female voters in the suburbs and the younger voters, 18–29-year-olds, who often don’t like the president.”
Analysts anticipate a possible reaction if the Republicans proceed with the confirmation even before Ford’s testimony against the High Court’s candidate, in which he argued about sexual harassment.
This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee for NBC News at the beginning of last week.
It’s not just about the committee’s vote or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is being questioned, it’s about how the Republicans have acted and how they have treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, leader of the Democrat Supporting Priorities USA group pointed out to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in whether they should believe Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony as the majority bends to the latter.
According to a new opinion by YouGov, 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, while 35% say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think that Kavanaugh is likely or has definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's impetus, the FBI investigates Ford's and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez's accusations, The Guardian reports.
In front of the Justice Committee, Ford sworn that Kavanaugh had harassed him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed to him his genital at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet attack on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to decide where to store their data, and who has access to which data.
In a Fast Company interview, Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt’s intention to “control the world”.
It has to be done now,” he said, pointing to his startup.
It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solidi’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data warehouse” or POD.
It can include contact lists, checklists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal data warehouse is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what types of data.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data”.
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, Inrupt’s idea is to give resources, processes and the required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, a security platform purchased by Bruce, IBM, a community of hired developers and volunteer coders working with the project.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website, all available from this week onwards.
Berners-Lee says he and his team aren’t talking to “Facebook and Google about whether it’s time to offer people a complete change where all their business models are turned on their heads overnight”.
We don’t ask for their consent.”
In a text published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote “the mission of Inrupt to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of a new network built for Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute even after Inrupt.
I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: City Remembers First World War Heroic Priest
The city celebrates the only priest who has been awarded the Victoria Cross medal when 100 years have passed since the events took place.
The Medal of Courage was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vanille 29.9.1918 due to the events of the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt villages.
Vann, however, died of an sniper four days later without ever knowing the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were revealing a memorial stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event was “impactly symbolic”; the monument was revealed exactly 100 years after the feat of his award-winning grandfather.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the “very dense fog and under the fire of heavy field guns and machine guns.”
Later on, he rushed to the front line and, “with the greatest sense of bravery,” led the troops to the field cannon alone before it was attacked, and in the following battle, Vann knocked down three cannon batteries soldiers with his own hands.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann died of a German sniper 4.10.1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s act was “something I could never achieve, something that arouses respect.”
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann counted the wreath after the parade of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it’s a “great honor to be part of the parade” and added: “a great crowd of people is remembering the glory of a true hero.”
MMA friends waited to watch the Bellator 206 tournament all night – TV channel showed Peppa Pig
Imagine a situation where you’ve watched all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event isn’t presented either.
There were 13 matches in the San Jose event, including six main series matches, and the show was to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK.
Six in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program changed to Peppa Pig viewers’ great astonishment.
Some viewers were not really happy to watch the night after watching the match.
One friend of a free match opened on Twitter, describing the replacement of a game with children’s drawn “some kind of sick joke”.
According to the law, the content in question was not suitable to be presented at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to change it to a children’s programme,” explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Communications at Bellator, explaining how to change the programme”.
Peppa Pig, yes”.
Bellator’s director Scott Coker said that schedules will be worked on so UK viewers can follow the events in the future.
I’m thinking about the re-shipment that will probably make the program work,” Coker said.
However, it’s six o’clock in the morning there, and we can’t show up before Sunday for our time, which in turn is Monday for their time.
We are working on the matter.
You can believe that when the program changed on their heads, messages started to move in one direction and another and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix the bug because we thought it was a technical issue.
However, this was not the case, but a legislative matter.
I can promise that this will not happen the next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual, trying to offer our fans more and trying too much.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt deserving for his sexuality
A swimmer and Olympic athlete, Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says that he only noticed when he came to secondary school that “not everyone is the same as me”.
Daley, who spoke in the Radio 4 channel's Desert Island Discs program by Lauren Laverne, says he spoke about the rights of gay people to give others ‘hope’.
He also explains how after having a child, winning at the Olympics was no longer so important.
The permanent host of the long-term radio programme, Kristy Young, has taken several months due to a free illness.
As a guest in Laverne’s first program, Daley said he felt ‘minor’ at a young age than everyone else, because “it wasn’t appropriate to like boys and jobs.”
He says: “To this day these feelings, feeling less and different have been reality, and they have given me the power and energy I have needed to succeed.”
She says she wants to show that she is ‘something’ so that she doesn’t disappoint everyone when her sexuality finally becomes revealed.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he performs at this year’s Commonwealth of Nations to appeal to criminalize homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he had come out because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The triple world champion shows that he falls in love with a man – the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – came as a “surprise”.
Daley married this 20 year old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
”If you experience so many things at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – “it’s hard to find another person of the same age who would have experienced similar sympathy and adversity,” Daley says.
The couple got a boy in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which Daley’s “full perspective” has changed.
If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal,” he says.
You know, there are bigger things than the gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at the age of only 40 years of brain cancer.
Daley said his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the most recent things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympics entry tickets, he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn’t tell him that he won’t be there anymore to be in the front row,” Daley says.
I held him by the hand when his breath stopped, only when the breath had really ceased and he was dead, I finally realized that he was not invulnerable,” he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze medals.
”I knew that this is something I’ve dreamed of all my life – to jump in front of the home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first song choice in the broadcast – Heather Small’s song “Proud” – which evoked feelings already when he was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets his skin for chicken.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 AM BST.
Semi-fit Mickelson bench replacement on Saturday at Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson from the United States breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to be drenched to avoid remaining in history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who played every two years for the record 12th time, moved to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for fourball and foursome on Saturday.
The American five-time Major tournament winner, which is usually the center of attention, now spent half a day as a cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to catch his punches.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, not even considered one of the most accurate drivers in his career, is not an ideal choice for the tight Le Golf National field, where a long-growing rougher will punish for inaccurate beats.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson in the field itself, the ninth game on Sunday is against the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays together with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to capture all four winning streaks this week.
If Americans who are four points behind 12 when entering a double game get a flying start, Michelson’s game can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his trust in his player, but what else could be said in the situation.
”He perfectly understands the role in which he played today, he clapped me on the back, crumpled and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is arguably one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine he would play two matches.
I imagined something else, but that’s how this went and we ended up in such a solution.
He wants to be as much in that field as anyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for more played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also mark the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyki says that his presence brings something undefined to the team.
”He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke at the expense of people and he’s a funny guy that everyone likes to follow,” he explains.
The younger players probably also had a great time with him this week, it’s amusing to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stake in the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a leader can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup's vast leadership position before the last day's doubles can become a bumpy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros there was a five-point lead position in relation to the Americans, but who survived as a winner with a lime line just and just the size of his nose and won at the narrowest possible margin between 141⁄2 and 131⁄2.
It reminds us of how we managed briskly at Valderrama, we managed briskly at Brookline, where we lost, but we won at Valderrama, albeit scarcely,” said Bjorn, after looking at the 2018 team’s 5–3 wins both Friday and yesterday, shifting to the 10–6 lead at Le Golf National.
History should be shown both to me and to all the other members of the team that this is not yet over.
Tomorrow we shoot with a big caliber.
We go to the field and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we only aim for that.
As I’ve always said, I’ll focus on these 12 players who play on our side, but we’re aware of what’s on the other hand: the best players in the world.”
Delighted by how his team players have performed in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I will never lick until I drop in such things.
Tomorrow is completely different.
Tomorrow, individual performances are the first priority, and then different things are discussed.
It is great to be in the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player’s capacity will be tested down to the bottom.
This is a message that must be communicated to players – tomorrow everyone can achieve the best performance.
Now you have to give up a partner who is allowed to go to [the field alone] and do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, counter captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the full turns of the last day in both directions, he was involved in the team that won Brookline before becoming a loser when the European team won with the “Medinah miracle”.
”I remember every bad word,” he answered the question of how the 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw put his team’s lines to the last day’s outbreak.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like what happened in Brookline, or like what happened in Medinah.
When you get things moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We’ve adjusted our setup accordingly and we’ll put the boys on the pitch the way we want, as you know, we’re going to do wonders tomorrow.”
Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will face their next European counterparts.
I put the guys of the group in this order because I think it carries the whole tournament through,” Bjorn commented on his choice of two-players.
German new warship is delayed again
The newest frigate of the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014, the purpose of the ship is to replace obsolete cold war vehicles, but it will be introduced at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and explosively increasing costs,” says local media.
According to a military spokesman for Die Zeit, the introduction of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying after-shipping problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
According to the information available, they are equipped with an efficient cannon, missile systems for aircraft and surface control, as well as stealth technology, such as radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic signal detection technology.
The important features of the vessel also include its longer service interval – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the home port.
However, continuous delays mean that warships representing the cutting edge of technology, which are said to improve German influence in overseas territories, are already obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate ended up in the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to adopt the platform and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns the ship after it has been delivered.
The reasons for the return are little known, but in the German media we have talked about the essential “software and hardware faults” that make the warship unavoidable for combat tasks.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the size of the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class ships is around 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet’s chances of subsequent updates.
With a capacity of 7 000 tonnes, Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the vessels used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the price tag of the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to have increased to 3.1 billion euros when the original price was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the introduction of new frigates have arisen when Germany’s naval power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Director of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet’s useful vessels are ‘low’.
According to the authorities, the problem has increased over time because old vessels have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been delivered to replace them.
He complained that no frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could have been put into service by the fleet.
Environmental Organization eavesdrops the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the terrain when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the new study will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide them in future conservation measures.
The research conducted by the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland examines the kneading and dwarf bats, as well as the earbuds and waterfoils in the Inrewe Garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage devices are placed in important points in the area to monitor the functioning of bats during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the organisation also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequencies of the sounds, as well as the species concerned, are ensured by the analysis of experts.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report is created, in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in an image that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the nature conservation advisor of the organization, hopes to reveal the results of which habitats are the most important for bats and how different species use them.
The information is helpful in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, so that bats and related species are taken into account.
Scotland’s and the UK’s entire bat populations have decreased significantly over the past 100 years.
Construction and construction work threaten the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to night-time hunting, their ears are more useful in catching catches than in the eyes.
Bats use advanced sonar technology to detect insects and obstacles on their flight track.
National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental organization that maintains more than 270 historical buildings, 38 remarkable gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who conduct regular surveys, rest area inspections and, in some cases, animal rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only protected area in the Dumfries and Galloway area of Threave Manor, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat species are found.
According to farmer David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
Threave is very suitable for bats,” he says.
We have old buildings and trees and a good living environment overall.
We don’t know everything about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us to better understand what bats need to succeed.”
He emphasizes how important it is to check buildings for bats before starting renovation work, because the destruction of one resting place of bats can inadvertently cause death of up to 400 female bats and chick and destroy a whole local population.
Bats are protected animals and are prohibited from killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the bat protection organization, encourages the public to participate in protection work.
He says, “We still have a lot to learn from our bats, and we still don’t know how to cope with their populations.”
Ronaldo denies rape accusations while lawyers prepare a case against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labelled the rape charges against him as “fake news” and says people want to “proclaim themselves” by using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action to challenge the German magazine Der Spiegel to justice.
An attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid the victim $375 000 for silence, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram for 142 million followers only hours after the claims were made, a 33-year-old soccer player sharply rejected the accusations and described them as “fake news”.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner said to the camera.
They just want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine,” the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers prepare the claims they have referred to by Der Spiegel as an “ineffective report on privacy concerns” according to the Reuters News Agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is claiming compensation for “spiritual suffering in accordance with the severity of the violation, which probably means the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged case is said to have occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are reportedly met at a nightclub and entered the player’s room, claiming to have raped him anally, are reported according to the papers submitted to the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo had landed on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was “a 99% good type”, but that “one percent” was disappointing.
According to the documents Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was about mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later ended up in a conciliation solution, because it was “a horror of the possibility of revenge” and worried that she was “a victim of public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old now says that he is seeking annulment of the settlement procedure because he has still traumatized the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the deal to move to Real Madrid at the time of the overrun claimed from Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus with an agreement of $100 million.
Brexit: The UK “would forever regret” the end of car manufacturing
The UK would “repent forever” if it lost its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, the Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered it “confusing” the announcement of the Toyota UK unit temporarily suspends production in Burnaston near Derby if the UK exits the EU without a contract.
We need a contract,” Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of border delays is visible as a loss of jobs if Brexit ends up without a contract.
A factory in Burnaston – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models – manufactured almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if the UK suddenly exits the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions in the production of our factory,” says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Burnaston unit in Toyota.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of exiting the European Union in how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its Mini factory for a month after the Brexit is completed.
The main concern concerns the risks related to the supply chain according to the car manufacturers when the contractless Brexit is implemented.
Toyota’s production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and cars are made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can cause disruptions at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
According to Toyota, maintaining a 24-hour warehouse at the Derbyshire factory is impossible, and production would be suspended.
Clark says Theresa May’s EU relations plan is “fully calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
We need a contract, we want the best possible contract that not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we must take advantage of,” he says in BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers’ statements show that we must definitely be able to continue the well-functioning supply chain series so far.”
Toyota can’t tell how long the production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and works as a trade union supplier at the factory, says with concern to grow among the members: “In my experience, lost jobs will never return.
The spokesperson of the government says: “We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Meeting Trump with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein can be ‘move up in the week’ due to the troubling around Supreme Judge-Rapporteur Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia’s interference with the elections, the connections of Trump’s assistants with Russia and the president’s possible action to prevent justice.
In Washington, it has been rumored for months that Trump intends to separate the Deputy Minister for Justice, which would jeopardise the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of separating the president based on the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has disputed the report information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was stated to have been Rosenstein’s resignation from office.
President Trump, however, was on a visit to the United Nations in New York at the time, so the day of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would “not” separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because the date of the meeting coincided with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI’s one-week investigation against Kavanaugh, which continued to postpone the vote of the Senate plenary session.
Trump’s Press Manager Sarah Sanders appeared in Fox News’ Sunday program.
When asked about Rosenstein, Sanders said: “The date has not been set for this, it could be next week, this week, it can still be postponed during the week due to everything else that is currently underway at the Supreme Court.
I always want to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists might disagree on this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked him why.
Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to reasons other than disgusting the “interpretation” of TV journalists, but said, “I do not dispute the fact that they are obsessed.”
However, Sanders allowed to understand that direct contacts between Trump and the press will increase.
”The president keeps more survey hours than any president before him,” he says, adding, without quoting evidence, “We’ve checked those numbers.”
Press conferences will continue to be held,” Sanders said, “it will be far better if media can ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We try to do this often and you’ve seen us doing this many times over the last few weeks, and this will be replaced by a press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when departing from the White House or participating in open events or press conferences with visiting value persons.
The appearance of a single press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the President may have shown a reason for this when he uninhibitedly and from time to time met journalists.
Minister of Health wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from EU countries regarding fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the employees of the Scottish health care system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for staying in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter when less than six months remain for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already prepared to cover the costs of applying for the ‘established status’ of EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes the following: During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible unagreement.
I know these times are uncertain for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat now how much we value every employee’s contribution to citizenship.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers supporter, Christion Abercrombie, has been in emergency surgery since the team was lost to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, reports Tennessee journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Head Coach Rod Reed told the suppliers that the supplier had done just before half-time.
He came to the sideline and simply shortened to it,” Reed says.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before placing him on stretchers and taking him to the side for further evaluation.
Tennessee State official told WSMV channel reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has had access to surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “the type/extension of injury is not known at this stage”, and that Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays his first season in the team after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when buying properties in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK, and the extra money will be used according to the new plans of the conservative party to help the homeless.
The purpose of the change is to neutralise Corby’s success in attracting young voters
The withdrawal of stamp tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today inform foreign buyers of the higher portable stamp tax rate when they buy properties in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby’s efforts to attract young voters, and Corby has made promises of lower-priced housing and paid attention to the taxation of people with good income.
The raising of stamp tax is targeted at people and companies who do not pay taxes to the UK, and the extra money from this will be directed to the government’s actions to facilitate the homeless’s distress.
The additional fee – added to the current stamp tax, in addition to the second apartment and investment housing increases added two years ago – can be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to generate up to £120 million each year.
An estimated 13% of London’s new buildings are purchased by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time home buyers in the owner-occupied market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK, especially in its capital, have transformed into ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in stamp duty as a means of facilitating the purchase of first-time residences for young people.
He accused major construction companies that they keep real estate prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to reject the quotas for low-cost housing to remedy the British ‘disgraceful living’ situation.
Corbyn has published a striking series of proposals to reform the housing market, including restrictions on rents and cessation of ‘confidential evictions’.
He would also like to give the council more power in matters related to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says: “I said last year that I intended to own the British dream of my Prime Minister’s term – that every generation should be better than their predecessors – to return.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy apartments as easily as hard-working UK residents.
Having too many people owning a home has become too distant a dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team”
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says that his “ultimate” goal is to become manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots has been excited about his challenge to lift a team from the north-eastern corner of the country back to their feet, which currently ranks third in the UK’s second division.
Ross moved to the “light stadium” this summer after directing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
As a player, I wanted to play my country team.
I got to the second team and it was there,” says Ross in the BBC: Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
As a child, I often watched Scottish games with my father at Hampden, and that’s something that has always pulled me back.
Such an event will only come if I succeed as a club manager.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former director of Alloa Athletic says he had not been concerned about stepping into the boots of his prominent predecessors in a prominent company, and he has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, I have my own success with whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Based on the structure and ability of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he says.
It’s not easy to get there, but I probably only think I’d be successful if I can lead the team back to the Premier League.”
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years: first as Dumbarton’s assistant manager and then for 15 months in the Heats coach group.
After that, he helped Allo to rise from the fall games of the third series and raised St Mirren from the fall fitness to the top of the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
I was probably at the actual crossroads with my career,” he recalls the time when he moved to Alloa’s leadership.
I really thought I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, I earned a decent amount and was able to enjoy some relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player must deal with a variety of things every week.
I still go through the same things, such as stress and work-related pressure, but running a team feels like the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I’m doing it, and I feel better in my own body than ever during my adult life.”
The whole interview will be available on Sportsound on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a pint is Saturday at 17.30, study shows
The heat wave of the summer has kicked the pubs struggling with British difficulties, but at the same time increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains grew by 2.7% in July, but restaurant sales decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin’s business consulting firm from CGA said: “Continuous sunny weather and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the world soccer championship meant that July was 2.8% higher than in June, while the month for restaurants was even worse.
The decline of 1.8% in the sale of restaurants in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful, and their like-for-like sales grew more than restaurant sales declined.
Pubs focused on the food side also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to drink out in their minds.
The sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% during the month, and the sales of food were down by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, a provider of leisure and hospitality consultancy services, says: “The results continue a trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the off-home dining market.
It’s no surprise that the struggle for restaurant chains continues, although the 4.8% annual decline in sales is blazing especially now that the industry is currently struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come to a worse seam for food-focused operators, and only time will show whether the temperate temperatures in August bring the respite that the industry needs.
The total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is the next bar and bar sales bar and restaurant business in the UK that gathers and analyses performance data from a group of 47 industries with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, considered to be a reliable measure in the industry.
One-fifth of children encrypt social media accounts from their parents
One-fifth of children – some of whom are up to 11 years old – encrypts social media accounts from their parents and teachers, research says
Study involving 20 000 secondary school students revealed the growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns that accounts can share sexual-toned content
20% of students said they had a ‘main account’ that is shown to parents
One-fifth of children – some of whom are up to 11 years old – create social media accounts that they encrypt from adults.
A study involving 20 000 secondary school students revealed the rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagram fake accounts’, referring to the sharing of images on the Instagram website.
The news has increased the fears that sexual content can be published on accounts.
20% of students said they would keep a cleaned ‘main account’ for parents to show while using other, private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager in which she hoped to be raped, after colliding with a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter.
A study commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Council of Rectors (HMC) found that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 had two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted that they held secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Director of HMC, says: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh from Doyle “Athletes’ Voice” to the Scottish Board of Athletes
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Board of Sports, and he attends the Governing Body’s annual General Assembly.
Doyle is the most award-winning athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, Chairman of the Board, describes the name as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international-level experience collected by the athlete during the last decade.
Eilidhi is respected tremendously among athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit immensely from appointing him to the government,” Beattie says.
Doyle says: “I look forward to my role as an athlete’s horn and hope I can be helpful and help steer Scottish sports in the right direction.”
The winner of four Olympic gold medals, the American athlete who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who now serves as the BBC’s permanent commentator, lost his walking ability as a result of a transient brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I got a stroke.”
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time shows whether I will recover and in what condition.
This has been an exhausting job, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I am already training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Mothers in cows-like advertisement shares opinions online
The mothers of the breast pump-producing company, who are breast-feeding mothers to dairy cows, have shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a manufacturer of consumer technology, has launched a product called “the world’s first silent and wearable breast pump”, and its marketing is accelerated with an advertising that reflects the style of music videos for mothers who are breastfeeding the freedom of a new pump.
Four real-life mothers dance in a barn filled with hay, among other things, with the following words: “Yes, I am milking myself, but there’s no tail” and “if you didn’t notice, they’re not udders, they’re tits”.
The chorus continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused discussion online.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has evoked a conflicting reaction in viewers, and many say it’s making the daily ‘terrors’ of the dairy industry a ruin.
Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
They need to get pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen from them soon after delivery,” a commenter writes.

The other viewer commented: “I understand it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why couldn’t they be used to promote a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
The third commenter added, “A perfectly fugitive ad.”
The ad also got defenders: a woman admitted that the ad had been ‘quirky’ in her opinion.
I think this is a great idea.
I’d get one if I’d still breastfeed.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy but I took it as it is.
This is an ingenious product,” says one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at the workplace or in the toilets) and ‘know themselves cows’.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the ad, video women reveal that they have danced unobtrusive pumps in their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and fits discreetly inside the nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Artistic Director of Mother’s advertising agency, commented: “The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry into the market.
At the breast, nursing mothers and dairy cows wanted to bring all the challenges related to the use of breast pump to the spotlight, we brought out the incredible feeling of freedom brought by the new pump in an entertaining and relatable way.”
The Elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk in designer Marta Jakubowski’s outfit using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in silence
Despite the fact that the monthly number of cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, the number of migrant children caught has increased sharply, partly because the rough rhetoric and politics introduced by Trump’s administration have made it difficult to invest children in foster families.
Most foster families have traditionally consisted of paperless migrants, and registration as a foster family can endanger their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult household members must give their fingerprints and that this information will be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level entry and customs authority, proved last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for minor immigrants.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have an earlier criminal record.
Almost 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we’ll continue to look for these people,” Albence says.
In an effort to process children’s cases faster, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which, in some cases, the matter must be dealt with in the court, instead of the 60-day time limit previously used, says the reception centre’s employees.
Many people prefer to take part in a video conference rather than in person in the court dealing with the affairs of the migrants.
Those who are not considered eligible for help will be promptly expelled.
According to staff at reception centres and reports published in recent months, the time spent by children in prison affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
According to attorneys, the concern is highlighted especially in larger institutions, such as Tornio, where signs of a child’s despair may go unnoticed due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many of the children already suffer from trauma at the moment.
Syria Commands US, French and Turkish “Humans’ Forces” to leave immediately
Walid al-Moualem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is in war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also acts as a substitute for the Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were in the country illegally using the excuse of counter-terrorism, and that “with them will act accordingly”.
They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed “the war against terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died in 2011 and beyond, and where millions of people have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the “holy battle until all Syria is purified” of both terrorist organizations and “illegal foreign troops.”
The U.S. has about 2 000 soldiers located in Syria, where they are mainly trained and guided by Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested more than 1 000 soldiers in the country to tear the battles.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said that the circumstances were good for returning and blamed “some Westerns” for “spreading irrational fears” that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
We have invited the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
”They are politicizing things that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid is not granted to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and opposition through a political agreement.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last insurrectionary base in Idlib has created an opportunity for political debates.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented the large-scale attack of Syrian troops supported by Russia, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has ‘clear time limits’ and expressed the wish that jihadists, including al-Qaeda-related al-Nusra front fighters, would be disposed of.
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meetings of the new government and the opposition committee to create a draft of the post-war Syrian Constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to ‘reviewing the sections of the present Constitution’ and warned against the matter.
Why Trump is selected for another season
In accordance with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the election and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidency decision ever!”
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, the best watch time figures have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on 1, 6 million MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best time of viewing compared to 1.7 million years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show has access to cable TV: 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
This is a flue that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neal Baer, chief producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor program, from the minister who rises as president after the blow has destroyed the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, “Because he makes me laugh,” Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade talks, whether immigrant family members can come to each other and how the world economy can.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And still goes beyond the conscious citizen’s obligations to look at the six-hour expert panel about the use of Bob Woodward’s source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort’s 15 000 dollar ostrich leather pilot jacket (Washington Post says “the arrogant garment”) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels’s unpretentious descriptions of the anatomy of Trump.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario again in the same way I used to.
What he does feels like a reality TV show, because it’s partly that he gives the audience something every night,” says the director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawnshop Series Brent Montgomery Trump’s show about changing people and daily changing plot twists (NFL dispute, Kim Jong-un’s praise).
You can’t miss a single episode, or you fall off the cart.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a lovely sunny day with him on the northern coast of Kauai, but he couldn’t go out because he watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not disconnect from the program in which Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate’s Justice Committee and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
I remember when we made all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss said.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.”

From the outside, money flows into a tight mid-term campaign
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania has faced real cash flow, as due to the reorganization of the constituent constituent constituents, two already elected candidates will have to fight in one place.
This newly demarcated Pittsburg constituency is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, who was established in the second constituent constituency in the last spring special elections.
Lamb competes with another selected candidate, the Republicans Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s 12th constituency, which is overlaid with the new 17th constituency.
The territorial division was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old constituent division favoured Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The competition in the new 17th constituency has kicked off the economic struggle in the main party finance departments of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The Lamb's name became familiar with Pennsylvania after the widely followed 18th March special elections in Pennsylvania.
The position had been with Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won in the region by 20%.
Political commentators have made a great head start for democrats.
US Planned Punishment to El Salvador for Supporting China, but retreated from its intentions
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and Washington’s mild reaction.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he also owned the hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump Organization’s management team.
The officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to invite American diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama “on the basis of recent policies that no longer recognise Taiwan,” said spokesman Heather Nauert in his statement earlier this month.
However, punishments were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in help from the United States in 2017, including drug surveillance, and development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including financial aid cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely hit the Central American State with a high level of unemployment and spirit crime.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity, and the corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
In mid-September, however, the senior administrators made it clear that the meeting wanted to proceed and this effectively decided to penalise El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pencen is now expected to give a sign to the mid-October scheduled meeting of what kind of weight the administration will give the assembly, the diplomats stated.
The three American ambassadors returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any further unpleasant messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, accompanied by two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke under the protection of the anonymity clause.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be Robert Mueller’s report on the possible blocking of President Trump’s right, which is now very weighty evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also reported a directional investigation on whether the Trump campaign was secretly co-operating with Russia when Russia was involved in the US election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump finds himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go to his voters again, and may be convicted of his peers.
Here are a lot of misappropriation and I don’t mean to say that President Trump’s defeat would be inevitable – the more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We have to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to defeat Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czech Republic in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the bloodbath of the years that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points where the inevitable advancement of democracy either accelerates or delays.
The Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What will we do if President Trump separates Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating Mueller’s case?
Rosenstein has been charred since the announcement that he had proposed the secret recording of the President’s speech and considered the President’s possible inability to carry out his duties.
According to Rosenstein, the Times report is incorrect.
How do we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh’s actions is not complete or factual - or if he is confirmed by the credible arguments raised against the Supreme Court regarding sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, do we vote in the mid-term election for a congress that considers President Trump responsible?
If we fail at these outbreaks, our democracy will end up in the long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to America as an immigrant, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated by a swagger.

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistic to meet Rapid Vienna
Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, knowing that in the same month after a draw against Villarreal in Spain, the Austrians would gain a strong position in reaching the Europa League Group G.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from reaching the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
It was a good result for us, because Villarreal is a good resistance,” says the 31-year-old player.
We started the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
Perhaps we would have been able to grab at the end of the win, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we got off to the second and we were better.
On Thursday, there is again an important evening in the Europa League.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a hard game because their result was good in the previous game, however, I believe that with the support of this group we will be able to give all we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the workouts go well.
I hope we can now fully print, leave the season behind and succeed.”
Fear of pension savings takes women a night’s sleep
Although the participants in the study had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, only a few had talked about the matter to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the nationwide survey said they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only ten per cent of the respondents said they had talked to their children about the matter.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” says Holly Snyder, Deputy Director of the National Life Insurance Company.
Get started like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell us about your wishes in time.
Talk to a professional and family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important cost factor.
Take financial advisors with you to the conversation: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance for covering these costs, or self-cost insurance, if you can afford.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative to name a trusted person to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that your professionals follow your expectations if you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drafting a power of attorney for the management of your financial matters.
It allows you to configure a trusted person to take care of financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your invoices are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parent would be on his way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Write such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
It’s not just about financially. Who’s his doctor?” Martin asks.
What drugs are in use?
Who takes care of the dog?
Keep your plan ready.”
The man was shot several times with an air rifle at Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home late in the evening.
Around forty years of age, Ilfracombe was a victim in the Oxford Grove region of Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The police characterize an attack at about 02:30 pm ‘random work’.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim’s injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed to eyewitnesses.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami, which hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, and according to the authorities, the sacrifice is expected to increase.
As communication links to the area are crossed, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the northern part of Palu from the area of Donggala municipality, which is closer to the surface center of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
After disaster, more than 16 000 people have been evacuated in return.
Key information about Palau and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami struck the city in the middle of its 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometres (180 miles) of the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative region under the province, with an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi province, in particular the coastal area of Donggala, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the coast opposite to Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, return and Donggala have been hit by several tsunnames over the past 100 years.
In 1938, Tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and often suffers earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunnames of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in North Sumatra on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26, which hit 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean coasts, with more than half of the victims in the area of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 The earthquake of magnitude struck the southernmost island of Indonesia, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast of the island, killing almost 700 people.
2009: 7.6 The earthquake of magnitude hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1 100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Sumatra Mentawai islands, causing a ten-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck Aceh's Pidie Jaya region, causing devastation and panic as people remember the massive devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than a hundred people died as the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Lombok Tourist Island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and Vice President candidate, has been arrested for insurrection.
According to a Saturday report by the Alaska police, Palin from Wasilla in Alaska, 29, was arrested suspected of domestic violence, as well as prevention and opposition to domestic violence in the event of detention.
According to the police report, Palin took a phone from his female partner when he tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is in investigation prison in Mat-Su Pretrial jail of investigation and the deposit amount is $500, reports the TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin came to court on Saturday and said he was “guaranteed innocent”.

He is also accused of class B violation, which can be condemned for a day of imprisonment and $2 000 fines.
Palin is not for the first time accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and reported an insurrection.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palinia was accused of domestic violence, accompanied by possession of a weapon under the influence of a narcotic.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of beating her face.
Veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for combining her son’s violent behaviour with a traumatic stress disorder caused by a service performed in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead

The earthquake of 7.5 magnitudes caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications connections are across and the victim number is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi to the northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
On social media, you can rotate videos from the time of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for beach festivals in the city of Palu, when the Tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider falling a rare death penalty on a suspect of a NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack involving eight lives of New York City, a rare penalty that has not been enforced in the state since the federal crime of 1953.
According to the charges, Saipov, 30, Home Depot’s rental car was used in his October strike on the West Side Highway in the south of Manhattan, where he was riding on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the New York Southern District death penalty notice, a death penalty is possible if prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and caused “intentionally” serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to fall a death sentence from both of these charges.
For weeks after the blow, the federal court insisted on Saipov on a 22-point charge, which included a charge for eight murders to assist the terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this offence in cases of organised crime, including a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The blow required “significant planning and preparation”, the prosecutors stated and described the way Saipov carried out his actions “true, cruel, and shameful.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the prosecution notice states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For the last time that the New York Southern District’s right has given a death sentence, it has been a decade since.
The respondent Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to suffer a life imprisonment sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in New York State in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as convicted of a conspiracy in favour of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is a Uzbekistanian, showed no signs of repentance during the days and months following the blow.
He told the researchers that his actions were good, the police told us.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said that Saipov also wanted the ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He replied to the 22-point charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov, said that the defense was “naturally disappointed” in the prosecutor’s decision.
We believe that a decision to demand a death penalty and not a recognition and a lifetime without the possibility of liberation is a solution that only prolongs the trauma to the parties involved in these events,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously requested that he not be required to be put to death.
A Conservative Representative says that NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today in a demonstration against conservatives to “mobilize the civic army.”
The former Ukip leader said that politicians need to feel the pressure of the Eurosceptors - when one of Theresa May’s own parliamentarians suggested him to lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative line representative Peter Bone said to the marchers in Birmingham that the UK would “be already outside” if Farage were Brexit secretary.
May, however, meets the gaps between its deeply divided lines, which is underlined by the conservatives from the point of view of being underlined by a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the surface of Brexit’s supporters and opponents, as well as on the EU’s squeeze.
The supporters require him to continue the contract with Brussels despite the setback - and to force the Eurosceptors and the working party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to “slam Chequers suggestion to go”.
He suggested that Farage should be involved and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would already be outside,” he said.
Wellingborough’s MEP added, “I’m defending Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal.”
He put forward his opposition to the EU, saying: “We did not fight world wars to become subjects.
We want to adjust our own laws in our country.”
Bone knocked out the idea that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: “The fact that the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely false argument.”
Conservative supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and said to the journalists: “Just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be advocated by the members of the party, nor by the activists who actually leave the streets and are in general responsible for our success.
Give up on the Chequers proposal and start listening.”
In a message addressed to May, he added: “The prime ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said that politicians need to feel pressure if they intend to spin a decision based on the 2016 referendum.
This is now about trust between the people and the political class,” he said.
They’re trying to water Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we don’t accept it.”
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are about to spin the Brexit to feel pressure from your side.”
We are going to mobilise this country’s citizens’ army, which gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until the UK is again an independent, self-government and proud state.”
In the meantime, the supporters marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waving “Tories Against Brexit” signs, the group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Working Party mocked conservatives of the security problems they had with the party’s application at the beginning of the meeting.
These are the people who say they get IT systems up and running, and all the technology for the Canada plus arrangement, and the frictionless limiting functions for free Irish trade,” he added.
It’s a full farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren seriously considering the presidential nomination
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says he is seriously considering a presidential nomination after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the City Hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated critique of President Trump, is confronted in November by Republicans Geoff Diehl, the co-chair of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren has been expected to run for Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th city hall meeting with the voters after the beginning of Trump’s season.
One participant asked if Warren was going to be president.
Warren replied that now is the time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it includes a woman in the highest place.”
Arrest in the shooting case of LSU Sims
On Saturday, the Louisiana Baton Rouge police announced that they had arrested a person suspected of having been shooting Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, withholding at 11am ET briefing.
The police had published a video about the Friday shooting scene and asked for help to identify the man in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus early Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a firing injury and died as a result,” police officer Murphy J. Paul told the media via the 247 Sports network on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted in interviews that he had been present, held a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not make any resistance and was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a 198-centimetre junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, playing 32 games and 10 starting last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 record balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that the Mercedes team arrangements are an important part of the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost to his own luck defending his position in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to his teammate.
Vettel went to the depot first and left Hamilton to drive a group of tails, which should have been solved by the situation.
Mercedes went to the depot later and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed by after a little contact and the Ferrari driver left the interior line reluctantly, giving up defending his position after his two third turns.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row and was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition as he continued to change tires when aiming for a quick stop and a fourth place to take Kimi Räikkönen.
He finally came to the depot in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed with the remaining eight rounds when Räikkönen took the fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job of making a double win,” Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump scoffed at the speech on Saturday at the request of Senator Dianne Feinstein that he did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter, in which he accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the event in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford’s testimony in front of the Senate’s Committee on Justice, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a demonstration of people’s “devilness, malice, and dishonesty.”
One possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been happening in the Senate a few days ago, when we see anger, people who are angry, nasty, wicked and dishonest,” the President said.
When we see publications and leaked things and then they say ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn’t do it.’
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you yearn for this information?
Do you remember his answers... do you yearn the document - ‘ oh, what?
Oh no.
I didn’t leak.’
A moment now.
Did we...No, we didn’t leak,” he added, with a sense of delight.
In July, Feinstein received a letter describing Ford's accusations of Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have occurred from his office.
I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s accusations, and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein said to the committee, according to The Hill.
”He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wishes.”
But his ban was not good for the president, who commented on the matter at the Saturday occasion: “I tell you that was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but that was the worst body language I ever saw.”
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual harassment and thought that the democrats would use the accusations for their own benefit.
They have decided to get back to power by any means.
You’ll see that meanness and malice, they don’t like who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get power and control,” Mediaite reports that the President said.

Flight pilot killed when hundreds of aircraft passengers escaped the earthquake
In Indonesia, the flight pilot has become a hero when he dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers were safely aired.
More than 800 people have died and several have been missing after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong afterquakes try the area and several people have been trapped in the collapsed material in the city of Palu.
While coworkers fled by trade, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his work in the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufr Airport in Palu.
He stayed in place and made sure that the current Batik Air flight 6321 was safely aired.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower, which he thought was about to fall.
He later died at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesman Yohannes Sirait stated that Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News news broadcast was announced.
A helicopter was prepared from Kalimantan’s Balikpapan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter managed to return.
This news breaks our hearts,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the sacrificial number will increase to thousands, as the country’s disaster authorities have announced that the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are in short supply.
The number of victims is still believed to rise because several bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo, the spokesman of the agency.
Even waves that have grown to six metres have destroyed Palu, where mass funerals take place on Sunday.
Military and cargo machines bring help and equipment to the area.
35-year-old family mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, director of International Red Cross Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross hastens to help survivors, but we don’t know what is waiting for us.
This is already a tragedy, but it can prove even worse.”
President of Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and said in his speech to the armed forces of the country: “I ask all of you to work day and night so that all evacuation-related tasks can be carried out.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Indonesia Lombok.
Micronesian Flight Crash: According to Air Niugin, one person is missing after the plane has crashed into the lagoon
In Micronesia, representatives of the airline that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific now report that one person is missing, even though the previous report states that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident researchers.
The airline does not immediately answer questions about lost passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane had hit the water trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and everyone’s condition was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact passage of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both announced that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had drifted over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
It’s a very good thing,” said Jaynes.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to wade in a sinking machine in water with a waist depth for emergency exits.
He told the passenger staff that they had paniced and shouted, and that he himself got a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seafarers who had been working on repairs at the nearby pier had participated in rescue work by transporting people to the beach by rubber boat before the plane sank into a deep water of about 30 metres (a hundred feet).
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died of damage by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in such damage.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the Prosecutor took part in the re-examination of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed hours as an expert witness in the field of information analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on the mobile phone when compiling the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the victim’s death night.
Rowlett said that he had received the location information of several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was contrary to his previous claims in Chambers on the evening he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis’ cell phone was with Chambers while Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis said that he had been in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis “ lies because my car was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the data stored on mobile phones, they had known each other only for a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed Chambers text messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
”He wiped him out of his life,” Hale said.
Final defence speeches are planned to be started on Sunday.
The judge said that he was expecting the trial to proceed to the jury later the same day.
The High Breed: What is an aware hip hop?
The Hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative concepts of the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to The High Breed band from Bristol, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, the messages of which were related to politics and social problems.
They want to return to the roots of hip hop and make the conscious hip hop once again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Again one dark man?!
New Yorkian nanny sues a couple for racist text
A New York childminder challenges a couple’s right to discriminate after accidentally receiving a text message from the child’s mother, in which she complains that she is “another dark-skinned”.
The couple denies that they are racists and parallels the challenge to “tightening.”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her annoyance when the new babysitter Giselle Maurice arrived to work on her first day of work in 2016 and she was lighted that she was dark.
EIIIIII, AGAIN DARK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
Then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
Having realized that Plasco-Flaxman had made a mistake, according to the New York Post, had separated Maurice, stating that their previous Afro-American nanny had been doing his job badly and had been waiting for the Filipino this time.
Maurice received payment for one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Maurice is now suing the couple to receive compensation for divorce and wants to make a compensation of $350 per day for a six-month period, as he was originally washed to live and work in the family, albeit without a contract.
I want to show them that you can’t do that,” he said to the Post on Friday and added, “I know that it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to racist claims, saying that the termination of Maurice’s employment was a justified solution because they could not rely on him after insulting him.
My wife sent him something he wasn’t supposed to say.
He is not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco explained in Posti’s interview.
But would you leave your child with someone you’ve been unfriendly to, even if you’re just accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Really?”
Plasco equated with the challenge of tightening and I said his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was “in a very difficult situation.”
Does one start chasing in such a situation?
It is not very well done,” the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still underway, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, engaging in their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that the audience would not identify with the talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born for a while after accepting the book, says from the letter: “It is difficult to empathize with the position of a person who first read the book before publication.
It’s amusing now that the huge popularity of Paddington is known.”
Considering that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children’s books about toy bear adventures, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary year of the book publication felt bitterly sweet because his father died the previous year.
Paddington he “described as a very important family member” and said his father was proud of the success it achieved.
”He was quite a quiet man, and not a wacky guy at all,” the daughter says.
But since Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like a child’s achievement for him; one you are proud of, even though it is not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced the success of Paddington in that way.
Although it was his creation, he always gave honor to Paddington himself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone
His daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save his life in vain.
Nad called occasionally and said that the situation was really bad that he wasn’t expected to survive,” Ednan-Laperouse says.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter dies in a couple of minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did so.
I said, “I love you immensely gold.
I will be with you soon.
I’m with you.”
Medicines that doctors kept his heart running gradually faded from his body.
He had died a bit earlier and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was running out.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where families and other people were around me.
I had to keep myself together.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who was mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane among other passengers - who knew nothing about the trial she was currently going through.
No one knew,” he said.
I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt enormous compassion towards Nadi.
That he needed my love and my understanding now.
I knew how much she loved my daughter.”
The grieving women are sending cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number for support.
Davis' son Tyler fell ill with depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don’t want any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45 in Lydney, says his son was a promising chef with a catchy grin.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile illuminates the whole room.”
However, he stopped working before his death because he felt like he was in “darkness”.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old little brother found his brother, who had taken the life from himself.
Davis says he is constantly afraid of the post-effects.
Davis created the cards “to tell people that there are people to talk to even if it is a friend.
Don’t stay in silence - you have to talk.”
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for many years and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years of cohabitation shortly after his mother died.
”He didn’t tell that he was below or depressed or anything like that,” Humphreys said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in the country on Christmas day, and when the children opened their gifts, he took no eye contact with them or anything like that.”
He states that Mark’s death was a difficult trauma for them, but they still need to figure out: “It breaks down the family.
It rips us apart.
But we just have to continue to live and fight forward.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI begins its investigation
I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted – time and scope – we could perhaps achieve a bit of unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “break” into the dead end of the supporters.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporter want FBI investigation?
Reluctance is about timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the success of the Republicans is weak as expected, their attempt to have the desired man elected to the highest court in the country becomes more difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called Senators to lobbie them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met through him his wife Ashley, the personal secretary of President Bush.
What happens after the FBI report is prepared?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 democrats currently sit, a vote is held.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow across the game and confirm his choice to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea falls during Kim's time
According to the South Korean legislator, the number of people who have defected to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un’s seven-year-old reign.
The Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Harmonization and reported that there were last 1 127 in 2011 they occurred 2 706.
According to Park, stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher human smugglers’ prices have been crucial factors.
Pyongyang has not been commented publicly.
Most of the defectors in North Korea are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone between the Koreans.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants and not refugees, and most often returns them by force.
Still technically, the relations between North Korea and South Korea in the war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on the ongoing negotiations on the dismantling of nuclear equipment.
This followed the June historical meeting, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed on a general effort towards the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, reprimanded the United States for the imposition of sanctions after the meeting.
Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and under circumstances we will never unilaterally start unequivocally dismantling our equipment first,” Ri said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
Minority director Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court’s nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said that he was temporarily incompatible with the Supreme Court.
Your fear commented on this in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called “hysterical,” Pelosi said of his own reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh forbade very emotionally the accusations that he would have harassed sexually Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was overwhelmed by his feelings, and at times he almost shouted and lost his ability to speak while telling about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democratic members of the committee without calling themselves “the grotesque and planned persecution of a person” organised by the liberals of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential defeat.
Your fear said that he believed Kavanaugh’s testimony that he was unable to act in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
I believe that he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” said Pelosi.
Your fear wondered if he was asked if he would be charged with Kavanaugh if his choice were confirmed and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
Let’s say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or FBI, he’s not valid not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the right he currently works in,” your fear replied.
Kavanaugh currently works at the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal.
Your fear added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case because Kavanaugh was known as a conservative justice.
In the hearings related to his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
There is no suitable moment for a hysterical and biased person to be elected a member of the court and we would be expected to say that it is wonderful,” said your fear.
Women need to cope with everything
It’s a legitimate fire talk over months and years of rage, and he can’t keep it without crying.
We cry when we’re angry,” Miss Steinem said to me 45 years later.
”I don’t think it’s unusual in any way, don’t you think?”
He continued: “I was helped by a huge woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she also cried in anger, but that she had developed a way to say to her speech partner in a situation where she got angry and started crying: “You may think that I am sad now because I cry.
Actually, I’m angry.”
And then he just continued.
And I thought it was ingenious.”
Tears are justified as a route of rage dismantling, although they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when I cried out rage and an older woman - a cold-railed manager I had always been afraid of a little - seized me from my neck and pulled me into the staircase.
Never let them see you cry,” he said.
They don’t know you’re furious.
They think you’re sad and then they’re happy because they made you feel sorry.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congress representative from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in her presidential campaign.
When Hart caught up with a non-marital relationship with Monkey Business in 1987 and went out of the race, the very frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason why he wouldn’t try to be president himself.
It wasn’t a very well thought out decision,” he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates and the least one more was needed.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.’”
As the campaign period was already long, he was behind the fundraiser and so he announced that he wouldn’t go to the race if he didn’t get two million dollars together.
It was a lost battle.
He was lighted that some of his supporters, who gave male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
”Do they think I get a discount?” he wondered.
When he spoke and announced that he wouldn’t start an official campaign, he fell into the power of his feelings - gratitude to his supporters, a system of frustration that made it so difficult to fund voters and delegates for election work, and hatred for sexism - that he could not speak.
You might have thought that I could get a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the reactions of the press.
You might have thought that Kleenex is my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone will probably be beaten as a memorial writing
‘He cried.’”
How the U.S.-China Trade War can benefit Beijing
The starting point for the U.S.-China trade war was insulting and although the battle is anything but over, the interdependence of the countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
The President of the United States Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing import taxes on China’s main export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new customs duties affecting imported goods for £200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of China’s imported products to the United States.
Beijing has responded at the same rate each time, with the last imposing a customs fee of ten per cent on US imported goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States in eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the world’s second-largest economic power would be weakening for a moment.
In order to get Washington back off, one should give in to his own demands, but public worship to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, the U.S. trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the inter-country dependency.
A quick political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, can create conditions that start an economic spiral in either country and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than the viewers have so far understood,” says Abigail Grace, Asia-based research assistant at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs says that the country is “ready” for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country after a devastating war of more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are improving.
The situation is now more stable and safer, thanks to developments in counter-terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to repair terrorist-destroyed areas to restore the normal situation.
The circumstances now allow refugees to return to a country where they had to leave due to terrorism and their unilateral economic activities in their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid in the country.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian government would be grateful for the help of the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that the government does not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirmed Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team at the final points of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now disappeared six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown itself when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn’s team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The US star player Phil Mickelson had trouble almost throughout the tournament and he hit the water with a 16-hole par-3 track giving a match to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of the four players who have scored 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth came out with a 5&4 European team against the lowest ranked player, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, ranked as the top player in the world, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most victorious European ever in the tournament with a total of 25.5 career points.
I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
The year has been heavy.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It’s all about the team and I’m glad I could help,” said Garcia after the European team’s victory.
He moves the torch to his compatriots Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2&1 in individual competitions.
I feel immense pride after winning Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring him,” Rahm, 23-year-old said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Strange stats from one of the best players of all time who has won 14 big wins and remains second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find the fairways throughout the weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, whose game was high-quality throughout the tournament.
The US team captain Jim Furyk said after a failed performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We pressured the European team on this morning games.
We put in the hand.
Honor to Thomas.
He is an awesome captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We regroup, work with the American PGA and Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
These 12 guys are awesome and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lift a hat.
We met our winners.”
Red tide algal bloom: concentrations drop in the Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota regions
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decrease in the amount of algae in the Tampa Bay region.
According to the FWC, more fragmented algae areas are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
Red tide algae bloom stretches along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee districts.
Ferries can be detected ten miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but are less frequent than last week.
Red tide algal bloom has also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, the concentrations ranged from low to high on the Hillsborough County coasts, from background concentrations to high levels in the Manatee and Sarasota districts, from background concentrations to moderate concentrations in the Charlotte County and from background concentrations to high concentrations on the coasts of Lee County County and Collier County were low.
The respiratory symptoms are still reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
During the last week, Florida Northwest did not report respiratory symptoms.
