Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, was diagnosed with mental illness and now she makes art on the subject - "Human should have the right to his own body"
Dozens of patient records hang from the ceiling of the Academy of Fine Arts’ Project room gallery.
Each one reads the name of Camille Auer.
Papers tell a multi-year story of how outside people have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
I wanted to tell my personal treatment history to make the violence of the process visible," says Auer.
With the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a year-long period of research involving appointments with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will start with a referral for ­diagnostics of gender identity, which will be conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Before this, he had already used estrogen that he had ordered over the Internet and was otherwise very long in his own repair process.
He felt that he was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a repair process in order to have sex corrected also legally.
The Trans Act, i.e. the Act on Enforcing Transsexual Gender (563/2002), obligates transgender people to forced sterilisation in order to obtain the right gender, for example, in the Population Register Centre and in the passport.
Currently, everyone who corrects their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive incapacity.
One has the right to decide on one’s own body.
This situation is unbearable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Trans Act has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has filed eight observations on the law and the European Court of Human Rights is a preliminary decision that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a legislative amendment under the direction of the then-current Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
The elections and the Finns Party rose to the government.
Now the change in the law is again stuck.
It is a matter of domestic policy disputes that are not even related to that law.
The Board of Directors does not want to raise it to the table, because there are disputes within the Board of Directors regarding amendments to the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychologist of the transpol in Tampere University Hospital from Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these, wrote a report that would define Auer’s right to care and help.
The sense of reality of the subject is exposed to staggering.
The idea of the subject itself appears to be fragmented in a borderline-level manner, and the unstable traits related to personality are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not given sex repair treatment.
According to the nursing staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then February 11, 2015 ­Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked down the television in the waiting hall of the transpol.
Later on, this television was created as a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
It’s crazy that any person defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but breast removal needs a diagnosis,” says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are more than the amount of your gender you have at birth.
Auer's experience is unfortunately not the only one of its kind.
The gender correction process is harder for many people for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its reviewers meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and right to their own sexual experience.
It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, claiming that their resources are not enough,” says Auer.
Many people who have applied for the process have mental symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
The medical staff may stipulate that the treatment cannot be started.
Preventing treatment and getting help can cause a person to get even worse than it was before the process started," says Auer.
Auer’s personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult age and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest".
Depression has been treated with medication and when Auer started using hormones, it became easier to feel.
He had finally been able to say the sensations that had already existed in childhood and in the age of teenagers.
That’s why the wide jaw didn’t seem to fit into your body and why the breast ­muses had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people near him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Today, Auer feels that he is already seen, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, the relatives’ comments might have hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when relatives are being misgendered.
They should know and they know who I am, but they do not agree or can internalize it," he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from a callusphoria, or bodily conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, it is not possible to obtain official confirmation for its own sex.
There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And that’s true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, the Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal gender.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code stating that he or she feels that he or she is of the other sex.
After half a year of consideration, the applicant confirms their application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland, and the Auer exhibition is also crystallised in this demand.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a collection of political and artistic works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can be used to bring about political changes during a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

CSO issued travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP Organization for African American Citizens has issued a travel warning for Missouri due to state discriminatory practices and racist attacks there.
The NAACP Missouri travel bulletin enters into force on 28 August 2017 and urges Afro-American travellers, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state where numerous controversial events have recently occurred,” the association’s announcement states.
The legislation that came into force in Missouri makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to court, and the implementation of state laws is disproportionately directed at minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
Human civil rights are violated.
They are stopped on the basis of skin colour and abused or killed,” said Rod Chapel, President of NAACP Missouri, to Kansas City Star magazine.
We haven’t heard one of the many cases in the same short period of time before.”
The Missouri travel bulletin is the organization’s first warning of the U.S. state.
The organization mentioned, for example, the racist comments on Afro-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in question earlier this year and was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. Missouri police arrested him even though he was not accused of a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to a study by the Minister of Justice of Missouri, according to which the police are more likely to stop the black driver by 75% than white.
The purpose of the travel bulletin is to encourage people to be on guard and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,” Chapel says.
People must prepare, for example, by involving money for the payment of guarantees or telling the relatives that they intend to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, in 2015, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixth most in the United States.
The travel warning is also an answer to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge discrimination in housing and employment.
The National Rights Protection Organisation (ACLU) recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after adopting immigration laws that oblige the police to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the organisation, adds to the profiling based on race.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and apply to other states, but recently, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the President and CEO’s supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä, Minister of Economic Affairs, State Ownership Steering (centre), has asked Finnair for a statement on the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo, says Yle.
According to the Minister, it is inconsistent with the state’s declaration of will.
The supplementary pension received by Vauramo rose this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on an additional Vauramo pension in February.
Finnair announced that it will give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has outlined that no supplementary pensions are used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the previous year’s decision-in-principle on ownership steering.
Sanctions immediately hardened speeches
Some time ago it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
The President of the United States Donald Trump and President of Russia Vladimir Putin, who met at the G20 meeting in Hamburg, seemed to get along with each other perfectly.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled down considerably.
The new economic sanctions signed by the U.S. Congress last week and signed on Wednesday in Trump were reacted bitterly in Russia.
For the time being, the most stunning response was heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which Trump’s Sanctions Act means “full-scale trade war”.
Even if Russian reactions were only to acknowledge as exaggerations and overlaps of political rhetoric, the tightening between the US and Russia is a fact after the short honeymoon after Trump’s election.
In the United States, the passage of the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
The Congress, however, adopted the law with considerable unanimity, but it was, according to the President, much more difficult to approve the law.
Trump criticised the law he had signed recently for being "significantly incomplete".
President Trump’s nose may have been the cause of Russia in particular, even though the adoption of a law restricting one’s power rights must have been repulsive.
As is well known, the United States conducts investigations on Russia’s possible interference with the presidential elections as well as the Russian connections of the Trump campaign.
The tightening between the US and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed to a tight and various scandalous twists have almost been revealed, it seems more and more obvious that foreign policy will not be carried out in the United States under the leadership of the President but despite the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the Russian relationship is a shrill in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the current security situation in the Union’s nuclear area in the Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has visibly exhibited the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far maintained at least its Russian policy in a uniform manner, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State with a lot of trade with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the New Sanctions Act in the United States are still unclear.
In the EU, it has been feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the impacts may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the fact that, for example, liquid natural gas lng, which is important to the US economy, has been excluded from sanctions.
Trade sanctions are a means of exacerbating world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well-thought-out and accurate.
Otherwise, they are easily more harm than good.
Nothing is sacred anymore?
The White House of Trump is now aiming for the Statue of Liberty
Lack of statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, along with American soldiers, fell the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists in Trump’s administration, was well aware of what he was doing in a fierce debate with Jim Acosta of the CNN channel, the Statue of Liberty being attacked by Miller in a word bias on the president’s proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruisers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the significance of the statue, and especially the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus’ poem was added to the statue’s pedestal – 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller shunned Acosta: “I don’t want to go back to history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... the symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller wasn’t wrong in itself, but it’s not just about history, as he himself said.
What is essential is Lazarus’ touching words, the only quality in which the state not only calls immigrants but the “poor poorest”: “Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.”
The poem is now more contemporary than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism; he made it clear that the poorest of the poor are not welcomed in the United States of Trump.
The dispute on the significance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute about the significance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus’s friends campaigned to attach the poem to the pedestal of the statue, well aware that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American republicanism with a classic symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem to the image was an ingenious feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to its original.
Rush Limbaugh – a mouthpiece that can now be regarded as some sign of Trump – claimed in 2010, that the Statue of Liberty did not represent an invitation to anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neo-conservatives who takes the United States torch into the world of darkness: “Lady Liberty comes out.
He takes the freedom to torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
Soihtu does not show the way to the United States.”
Rarely enough, Limbaugh was partially right.
The significance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying trip.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforting by giving hope and welcoming.
And that is not what Miller and Trump in any case wants.
Their torch does not show the way, but stirs the flames of anger, their only power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members in the UK
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots reached the UK national team
Neil Black, Head of Results of the UK Athletics Federation, says that 16 Scottish members of the team participating in the World Championships are ‘significant confirmation’.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships starting on Friday in London.
According to Black, there is something special happening in Scotland, which the British athletics must learn from.
This is welcome, and we’ll continue to study it for so long that we understand what it’s all about,” Black says.
I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the Institute’s activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation, on the other hand, believes that it is related to the Federation’s activities,
and the UK Athletics Federation believes that it is based on their activities.
And an ordinary street steward thinks he must have something to do with the matter.
However, it’s something absolutely awesome, which is why.”
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for some serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5 000-metre run, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the captain of the national team.
Eilidh is too modest.
His captain’s speech was amazing,” Black says.
Athletes were proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidhi’s words had a genuine feeling and passion for sports.”
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist of the Commonwealth Championships in the 400-metre Fence, and these are his fifth World Championships, who thinks it’s ‘believable’ that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Mid-range runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records during the year.
He competes in London on 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O’Hare runs in London at 1 500 metres, and he’s also worth looking out for: he has an excellent season behind him, including wins in the World Cup Qualifiers and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first world championships, with Lee McConnell being the only Scots in the national team.
The captain of the national team says he’s “hugely proud” that there are so many Scots involved, some of which are serious about final positions and medals.
It’s a great honor to become a captain, but it’s even more special because the team members voted for the captain,” Doyle says.
Of course, I am very proud of all the blinds that reached the national team.
It shows how far we have gone.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for prize positions.
My captain's speech?
I thought it went quite well.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be insanely stunning.”
Blocking reviewers on Facebook: Don't stand for public office if you can't stand up to criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics, all the way to his political principles.
Critique certainly annoyed,
but he did not silence his critics.
If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as stupid and silent as sheep for slaughter,” Washington said in 1783.
That’s how we get to Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their performers.
The U.S. civil rights union has sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was also underestimating online.
What does it matter? This is just Facebook,” many people commented.
But it matters,
especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of the Democratic state.
He has received second-highest ratings for his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not easily responsive to hot dogs.
He has led the state firmly and strictly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main communication channel for his voters and published an image of a baldened person in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users coming to the Governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous.The Governor’s page is a public and official forum that is maintained by his staff with tax funds.
Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions in an interview with Washington Post, who said it was just a matter of comment moderation.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers, or haters is too easy.
Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to chat with the leaders of their choice, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told them that their comments were respectful, attentive and relevant.
In his comment, the Pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
The lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from the Bowie of Maryland was not hostile but asked the question of hate crimes.
I politely commented that Hogan had not commented on hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in the comments of the news from Washington.
I also can’t accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately regarded as an organized group and ignored as a large group of worried citizens.”
The Governor’s staff called the comments “centralized attack” and someone else could call them to promote important things.
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking or deleting a critical comment.
In the past, it would have been necessary to send staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
Actually, however, it’s all about the same thing, now only digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of constraining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision on the topic was made last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria District Court judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County government broke the first addition of the U.S. Constitution when blocking voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. National Rights Association visited Kentucky with the Republican governor Matt Bevin for the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
At the time of Washington, inexpensive postage payments had an impact similar to today on the internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, with anonymous writers hammering Washington.
Already at that time there were trolls.
Names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers where they barked Washington's decisions.
The President’s Office received petitions in which Jay’s agreement, the United States-British Agreement on Cooperation, Trade and Maritime, was criticised, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, and online notifications of a couple of, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Scientist Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Greenfinches have died of a parasitic disease called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a native animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit the pigeons, and especially the pigeon.
However, in the 2000s, the disease began to be observed in pebble birds as well.
In 2009, there was a proper crash.
Then the trichomonosis caused a big collapse in the Finnish green dome population, after which the strains of the species have been revived.
There have now been sick greenfinches, but at least not yet on a large scale,” says Juha Honkala, Museum Master of Natural History at the University of Helsinki.
There is a fear that the previous epidemic of greenfinches will be renewed again, unless something is done.
What you need to do now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop feeding birds immediately.
More on the topic later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European leader Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home field advantage for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Last year, Rafferty from Northern Ireland headed the next-door tournament on Archerfield Links before the last round, eventually losing to Paul Eales, who is delighted with the new location and serves as the ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvad.
I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it gets to its full glory,” says Rafferty.
Players see the field at its best, it’s in great shape.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great introduction to this field.”
English Eales defends the championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
This really feels like a special occasion,” says the player living in Southport.
I couldn’t defend Extremadura Open’s win because the tournament isn’t part of the tour this year.
It's great to return here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories come to mind: the tournament win was a great deal for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time we will always remember.”
Gary Orr returns to real action on his own soil and embarked on a tour earlier this year after turning 50.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
Playing at home is always more common,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
You want to succeed, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again and played pretty strongly.
I am pleased with my game so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament is attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Parking in the car costs £5 if the car has only a driver and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Potential indoor air problems of barracks were investigated in Säkylä
At least for the time being, indoor air problems have not been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade’s message company in Säkylä, the brigade was reported on Thursday.
Indoor air research continues.
The studies began when a man interrupted his conscript service for health reasons thought that his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air quality.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been detected in the health situation of other conscripts.
It turned out that it was an individual case, and there have been no health problems for other servicers in that unit.
Every report is taken seriously and we wanted to find out this matter thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
The brigade’s announcement states that due to the arrival of July, goods must have been moved to barracks, which may have led to a temporary increase in dust.
Because of this, the air may have seemed stuffy,” Holma says.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold Country
Bardina Degei does not use stove in cooking.
He only rarely uses a pot.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania region, located in the restless province of Papua, Indonesia, and when he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato – locally “nota” – straight into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato returned to the karre is eaten greedily by bare, unwashed hands.
Degei’s home has no furniture, he sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually also handles his daily chores, such as laundry in the cloudy water retrieved from a nearby swamp.
The office of the toilet is provided by a bucket in a ceilingless room.
Degei is the youngest of the four wives of her husband, and her fields are not to be kept.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the village’s men are unemployed, and many people drink a lot, and soldiers must be taken into account.
No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,” Degei says.
This is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1 026 village elders were forced to vote in public in front of the occupation forces.
The Dutch anti-Dutch local independence movement quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, keeping the region under strict control and preventing foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a secluded and plentiful journey, starting on a one and a half-hour flight from the capital of the province from Jayapura to Nabire and continuing on a five-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport here.
Around 19 000 inhabitants have wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, the roofs of which have been stained with yellowish brown.
Only a few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribesmen worshiped the god of Uga Tamee.
Other changes have also taken place.
We didn’t have such clothes,” Degei says, meaning her colourful, hand-woven wrap hat, dark skirt and bright colored blouse.
”Before we only had leaves as a blanket for our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also the gold of Indonesia.
Paniai is a highland area of approximately the size of New Jersey, with a population of 153,000. Only a hundred kilometres from Pania, it is the Grasberg, the world’s largest and most productive gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine generated €3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
Papua also has an estimated $78 billion of tree resources.
But for the Papua people, these riches bring misery, for they mean the suffocating presence of the strong army of Indonesia.
New York Times revealed in 2005, that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and military units between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers paying up to $150 000.
Papua’s demands for a greater right to self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 Pauans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s were related to genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area in peaceful protests.
The Brisbane Archdiocese report We Will Lose Everything from 2016 contains reports of previous year’s atrocities, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and relentless attacks towards peaceful protests.
It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases weekly,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened when Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83 per cent are Christians, but population structure is changing as Muslims move from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi to the region in the hope of better livelihood.
Javanese warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mix in peanut sauce.
It is difficult for locals to compete.
Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market place cheaper than locals,” says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the capital of the province after work.
Local women lost their customers.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised to address the injustices and human rights violations of Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
Papua consists of 29 areas, and this former carpenter won a vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel deceived.
Our hearts broke because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice,” You says.
The pania experienced some kind of wave base just two months after Jokow’s October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the campfire in Enarotal 7.12.2014 when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The scared children said to the soldiers that they should use the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers seized the children and abused them by beating them with rifles.
Thus, one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into the coma as a result of assault.
A couple of hours later, the building of the State Election Committee near the venue was set on fire, and the next day it began to happen.
About a thousand Pauans – young men and women and children – gathered in front of the local police station and military command centre to claim justice.
They had the hunting bows for the party, and they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they danced in a ring and imitate a bird song.
Some protesters began to stone the police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: “If the crowds are resisting more than three times, shoot them to death.” The information is based on an official document that has not been published to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident leader of the Kego Koto area, suspected that the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen anymore.
When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist,” he told TIME about his brightly painted wooden house on the porch.
Kayame still does not know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
Several shots were shot in the crowds.”
Alfius Youwi was shot three times; his cousin saw the firings.
I ran to him and made sure that it was really he,” Yohanes told TIME sadly, like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
”I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told the journalists that the police only “protected” the police station because it was under attack.
We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
That’s when it’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
Information about the deaths went to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that Papua’s violence would be addressed.
I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again.”
Minister for Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch reports of human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he immediately began to cancel his speeches.
Most of the violations took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes,” he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind, he said he was not going to start investigating in Papua.
Everything is cleared in court,” he said.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of ‘infringements against humanity’. The crimes are related to the death of more than a thousand people in the East Timor’s bloody independence vote in 1999. Wiranto told TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including Pania events.
The families of the victims of pania are disbelieving.
I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way,” says Yohanes.
I’m already tired of this.”
He says he still lives in fear, even though the event has been happening for years.
”I’m afraid,” he says.
”I’m afraid the army will arrest me, I’m afraid I’ll be shot.”
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Spaniards do not dare to discuss the event.
He tells that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped to bury four of the victims.
The soldiers were looking for me in their hands after the burial of the victims,” he says.
Shots have not run out.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring area of Pania in Deiya.
One was killed and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, which began when the manager refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, including children.
The man in need of hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had come to the water while fishing on the nearby river, and he died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned the police who responded with warning shots.
However, according to the locals, the police unit of the Indonesian spouse-provided police opened a fire in front of the crowd, causing one villager to be killed.
We are terrified, we are afraid of revenge,” says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw when the wounded were brought into care.
I’ve been hiding at home for two days.”
Deiyai Parliament has demanded the responsibility of police officers who have shot shots and the dragging of a mobile police unit out of the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction with the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes who live on the lush mid-highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels claiming to defend the rights of the Papuans with random attacks and the kidnapping of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of OPM’s leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of “security of national sovereignty”.
Some of the arrested never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as “the sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is only a few rice for sale in Enarotal, and it is too expensive for the locals too,
like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market place.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10 000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to local better educated and more wealthy migrants.
Only a few beans have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here,” says John Gobai, Chairman of the Pania Family Council.
The secluded Papua from the world is left with little attention.
In addition, the restrictions on international news are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare filming permit because of their inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Asia’s Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kine, Jokowi has not kept her election promises and has not increased transparency or promoted development by eliminating restrictions on news coverage.
Journalists who report on Indonesia’s restless easternmost provinces of Papua and Western Papua have new risks: refusing a visa and getting blacklisted,” Kine stated in her statement.
The lack of freedom to operate in the press means that the Indonesian government is under pressure only by the neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s ‘a number of and widespread crimes’, including the Pania firing scene.
These states have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
The Indonesian Foreign Office spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, disputed the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the Dutch delegation, headed by human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says an anonymous source that participated in the meeting.
There are presidential elections 2019 in Indonesia, but the parrots say that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokow.
Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are tangled with the Pania firing scene,” says Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panic: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in poverty and poverty, practically without healthcare services and training opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Spaniards, like the rest of the parrots, consider Jokow to give the votes as a “debt” that must be repaid.
They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threat and intimidation, the victims of Pania’s firing attack once more demonstrated resistance in a metaphorical manner: they buried one of the victims on the land opposite the police station and military site.
They know that you may never get justice, but at least they do not let responsible forget about their crimes.
My family member was killed,” Yacobus says head pressured.
What else can we do?”
Dereck Chisora rails at the cancellation of Robert Helenius' rematch: "Even fans of their own don't want to see"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were supposed to be in the Hartwall Arena on 27 May.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora rolls over in a recent interview with IFL TV the reason for the flop of the rematch completely on Helenius’ shoulders.
My match in Finland flogged, but it was not my fault.
I don’t live in Finland, I don’t want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don’t want to see him fight because he’s miserable, Chisora upsets.
Helenius and Chisora first met at the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial point award.
Ticket sales for the rematch were sluggish, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match was postponed to the autumn.
There has been nothing new about the match.
However, the cancellation will no longer harm Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled anyway when Chisora fell ill.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up to severe pain.
My tyranny was about to explode.
It was said in the hospital that I should be cut, Chisora says.
At the moment, the British claims to be in about 45 percent condition.
He is not interested in rematching with Helenius, but the aim is Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss for Whyte in December with a distraction.
Fire took over the Torch skyscraper in Dubai for a second time
The flames occupied one of the tallest residential buildings in the world in Dubai on Friday, and hundreds of residents had to flee the 79-storey building, which was 337 metres high.
This was already another fire within two years in a building whose name hurts to be Torch, torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured, and for the reason of the fire there was no idea immediately after the event.
We were sleeping and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and the shouts of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue authorities, fires were extinguished by fire in the four mornings by the local time and left to cool down the building.
The Board of Directors announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After the fire of 2015, the Torch building board conducted a study to find that the panels used for cladding and insulation of the facade suffer the most damage.
In the UK, the police believe that the insulation and cladding boards of the Grenfell Tower in London could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire where 80 people died in June.
A moped was stolen from the Joensuu parking lot during the night
A moped was stolen from the Joensuu parking lot between Tuesday 21 and Wednesday 5.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was from Sky Team Monkey.
In color it is red, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was later found on Thursday.

More than 20 percent of air passengers in the United States take prohibited items, reveals a survey
An air passenger survey reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had knowingly or unknowingly passed over the U.S. Department of Transportation Security (TSA) inspection points, at least six percent of passengers had knives or other bladed items that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one per cent said they had only since learned that they had been carrying weapons, ammunition or explosives in error.
The survey was answered by more than a thousand passengers and was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
Of the passengers consciously infringing TSA rules, 19.7 per cent were Y-generation representatives and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X-generation.
In most cases, the rules were violated by taking food and liquids to the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted that they had consciously exported objects with a blade to an aircraft, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported that they had consciously exported prohibited drugs to an aircraft.
The survey was attended by passengers from all over the United States, and the company wanted to find out how many had accidentally passed smuggling goods and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travelable goods are also most likely to pass a security check – knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey states, the TSA guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids to take to the aircraft and how much.
So it’s no surprise that most TSA confiscators are liquids.
For some time there was also a suspicion that books should not be taken to the aircraft.
Liquids may be taken on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, decided to delay decisions made during Obama’s period to reduce emissions
A day after 15 states had sued EPA Director Scott Pruitt, Pruitt withdraws his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce emissions from smog during Obama’s administrative period.
According to Pruit, the change shows that the agency he is leading takes better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers.
In a word, Pruitt did not mention the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
States should start to comply with the ground-level ozone standard for 2015 from 1.10. onwards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by a year, so that his agency would have more time to familiarise itself with the plan, since the agency “will not interfere with local decision-making or impair economic growth”.
Prior to appointing President Donald Trump as EPA Director, Pruitt was a general prosecutor of the Oklahoma State, known as the opposition to stricter environmental regulations.
Since entering Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly attempted to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
A sudden change in the mind of Wednesday is the latest setback for the plan of Pruitt to mitigate the regulations.
Last month, the federal appeal court in Washington, D.C. issued a decision that the EPA leader exceeded his mandate in attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama government decision on oil and gas companies, obliging them to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In his statement on Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his full translation of the ozone regulations merely strengthens EPA’s cooperation with states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge its right to reach an agreement on schedules,” he said, in his previous action, he challenged the Environmental Agency’s right more than ten times.
We don’t believe in regulation through court and take deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about the regulation concerning our operations and the powers it has granted us.”
However, the EPA’s opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to ‘use its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers’ to ensure that the provisions ‘are justified and based on the best available information’.
In Congress, Republicans are driving a wider change in ozone regulations.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, Public Prosecutor of the State of New York State, who challenged the EPA to court this week, said that the group intends to continue the pressure.
The EPA’s change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of the smog in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and District of Columbia were involved.
Ground ozone is created when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing difficulties for sensitized groups of people, as well as a partial cause of thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health promoters and environmental protectors rejoiced at the surprising change in direction of Pruitt.
It’s worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy in charge of our breathing air use common sense,” says Lori Ann from the Burd Biodiversity Center.
We still have to fight against Trump’s regime, as its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other groups in their own interests.”
Supercar manufacturer becoming SUV - "is happening in Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari’s style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year, when the Italian supercar manufacturer introduces its new five-year plan, Automotive News news.
All Eastern Savonia measles cases of the same virus type
Rantasalmi measles infection is of the same virus type as previous cases of Itä-Savo, says THL.
The Estonian Laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has ensured on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is the same virus as previous infections.
The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has ensured that a person from Rantasalmi on Friday, 28 July confirmed measles infection is of the same virus type as previous cases of Itä-Savo.
Based on this information, all infections detected in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles detected in the area in June.
The news is good, as it means that we haven’t seen any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may still appear until mid-August after the fifth person has been ill, and the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for basic health diseases at Soster.
New measles infections or their suspicions have not become apparent after the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to ensure that their vaccination protection is up to date, Erkkilä points out.

Finland prepares for the making of squeaking with permission
Pontikka soup was not even considered for legalization.
In the background, the basis that the process produces, in addition to liquor, methanol, which is toxic.
It will be legal to prepare the squeaky at home next year, but the legalization of the tongue soup will not even be considered.
The squeaking is made by fermentation, while the tongue is distilled.
The reason for the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to the spirit.
There has not been a political will to regulate the soup of the tongue into everyman’s right,” commented Ismo Tuominen, Senior Ministerial Adviser at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the tongue was not considered for legalisation.
The matter was also not brought to the political table.
There was no discussion about distillation, says Member of Parliament Outi Mäkelä (National Coalition Party).
He is in the negotiation group of parliamentary groups of the government parties, who took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
The permission to distil the tongue at home cannot be granted even in the future on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Tuominen says that there is a simple rule for the domestic manufacture of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be produced at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can also legally make squeal at home.
The Board of Directors has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and enables the production of squeaky stones,” Mäkelä explains.
The preparation must still take place so that the ingredients, or the flavors and aromas created in connection with their fermentation, are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, drinks can be prepared as much as they wish, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It should still not be put on sale.
The act of squeaking is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75 per cent of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The proposal for an Alcohol Act is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be processed by Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act enters into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is like Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital due to suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already left the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius suffers his prison sentence in Atterridgeville's prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital in the afternoon.
The prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examinations.
The communications officer of the Pistorius family, on the other hand, told that the former top athlete is in order.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned a six-time Paralympic gold medalist for six years to prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Transcribed telephone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build a border wall
Transcriptions of phone conversations between President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have leaked to Washington Post.
Trump called on President Enrique Peña Nieto, Mexico, in a phone conversation on 27 January 2017, to end his public speech that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States agreed that Nieto had knocked out a wall project in public, “you cannot say so to the press,” Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the cost of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a transcription of Trump’s first call to Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull during the call, with a tight word exchange.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia must be ‘lumb’, ‘wretched’, and ‘naughty’. According to Trump, an agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like a ‘idiot’ because he had proposed an inhabitant ban on refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by stating to Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call of the whole day”.
Georgian massacre: Activists re-enacted racist slashing in hope of justice
The Ford Mercury car passes the crowd in the small town of Monroe in the Georgian countryside and continues its journey towards the little Moore’s Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man dressed in striped costume, takes a deep breath of his cigar and swirls through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
Roger, n---u!” the man squats.
”Out of the car!”
Screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-enactment that was presented on 22.7.2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the muzzle loop is threaded around the “Roger” neck.
Since 2005, the human rights organizations have returned to Moore’s Ford Bridge to re-enact the events of 1946, at which time Ku Klux Klan slunked two black-skinned couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
It’s confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though murderers live with us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the re-enactment arrangements.
It’s a shame in history, but above all it’s a burden that weighs on our soul.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian Congressman.
For him, re-enactment is a startling call to action, and it also reminds Monroe’s inhabitants that wrong has never been fixed.
We want the culprits to be right, we want things to be finally concluded, and we want to recover from grief and make a reconciliation, but above all we want justice,” says Brooks.
We can’t recover and reconcile until we get justice.”
The death researcher covers the body of the deceased victim in the Georgian massacre 27.7.1946.
According to the FBI documents received by the NBC news, more than 50 men of Monroe and the surrounding districts were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was accused of murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, according to activists, the motives of denting have been constantly known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Georgian state's blacks were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential elections, and the Supreme Court adopted its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, an incident occurred at the time of the election, in which the black-skinned farmer Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently concerned Malcolm's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, it was rumored that Hester had had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting him a child.
According to FBI’s information, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid a deposit of USD 600 for Malcolm, against which he was released from prison.
On their way home with Malcom and Dorothy were their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before Moore’s Ford Bridge.
It turns out that Harrison ordered and organized murders,” the FBI report states.
It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, the authorities involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks expresses this more concisely.
It was a suffrage,” he says.
They were murdered because they wanted to communicate to the blacks that it would happen to them if they were to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been guiding the re-enactment of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and captivating, a depiction of a shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the present day in the United States.
It is difficult to look at the performance, but it is even more difficult not to see what Greene says is meant to be.
We don’t want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark side,” says the director.
But I can’t create a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or don’t want to hear what I’ve experienced.”
This year’s performance began in June, and on the first day about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and twenty whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant director of Greene.
He has been performing the local director of Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh says.
However, it is important that this side of history is kept on display so that it never again repeats.”
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, practice their turns.
The performance begins with a scene where Malcolm screams and pushes Hester, furious that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
Didn’t you hear? I said I would leave my country, n---u!”
Rascona or Hester answers.
Then you start the punch.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
”What?!” Rascona asks.
He is confused.
Did I accidentally hit too hard?” he asks.
No,” Greene says.
I just don’t think whites used the word n--u at the time.”
”Yes,” another black-skinned actor confirms.
”It’s slang, you have to use a longer version.”
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the performance, they want to respect the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene starts from the start.
Now the words of Rascona sway.
No one laughs.
The re-enactment runs out quickly and violently.
Scream, shots – and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral costume stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday’s Strange Fruit song.
His voice is broken in every other word.
A few ten metres away, fifty viewers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost exactly half of the audience is black and half white.
Among them there is a couple who have come to see a show about Ithaca in the State of New York, but most are local.
They have been guided by Brooks to the tombs of the victims in the pressing humidity of Georgia.
Murders have turned the story into reality.The atmosphere at the venue is heavy.
After the vocal performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
”They are not really dead,” the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who performed the dynasty strip off their cloaks and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a hard show.
”No worries,” the woman in the show comforts.
”We know that you are not he.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and actors gather for a shared dinner.
The white couple from Alta talks livelyly about the performance with their newly met black couple.
Denise Duplinskin is hard to find words when she describes the sensations that the performance brings.
It’s hard to listen to horrible words and watch horrible actions that say and do people who look the same as you – just because they look the same as you,” he says.
I found out that the loops are still happening,” he added, “they are just called arrests.”
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners at the same table.
He says he has already started planning the next year’s performance.
Reclining is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we experience, but it is also an educational experience,” says Brooks.
Its message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.”
Replacing vegetables in stores swells: This amount by removing "extra parts" really saves
Is it allowed to remove cauliflower leaves already in the store before weighing?
How about taking out a big hat piece from a pineapple - it weighs how much?
The answers share opinions strongly: for one, it is an indication of extreme sleep, while others do not want to pay for parts of vegetables that are not used and, however, which go home to garbage.
The phenomenon is identified yes in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket vegetable department in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, as many of them tear off the leaf parts of cauliflower.
From the box, the leaves are taken to the store’s biowaste.
According to the news published by Taloussanomat, sniffing at the vegetable counter surprises traders.
But how much money does it really save before weighing the extra parts of vegetables?
How important is the sniffing technique really?
We Women tested how the price changes when you take off the leaves or strains from pineapple, artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower that costs €2.10 was €1.80, when it was peeled off all the leaves.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple, worth €2.30, fell to €1.95 when its strain was turned away.
Latva Artichoke: The price of 2.60 euros was 2.40 euros when the short stand was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost 1 euro and without a strain of 80 cents.
Result: If leaves and stumps leave to pluck, save at best a few dozen cents for one vegetable.
Considered as a percentage, the price of vegetables decreased by up to 20 per cent.
This would have saved a total of 1.20 euros for these purchases!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - brass star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, says the news agency AFP.
Previously, on Thursday evening, Neymar’s representatives had paid the buy-out price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, a player in the Spanish league.
The staggering EUR 222 million transfer amount is the largest in soccer history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million for French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league brake the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar representatives.
According to the league rules, a club that buys a league cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player himself must buy out his contract, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the amount to Neymar and his representatives who provided money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
Barcelona also stated in its announcement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association Uefa so that the Federation could determine any disciplinary measures that may arise from the case.
Among other things, Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, has suspected that PSG will be in breach of the rules of Uefa’s fair financial play.
Uefa may punish a club that makes more than EUR 30 million in losses over three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar’s transfer does not automatically break its economic lines.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will affect the club’s finances for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG might sell multiple players with significant amounts, Uefasta was announced.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatari company.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelafi from Qatar.

Austin, 21, got severe burns from lightning strike - flash saved in airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing ordinary work on the plane at the International Airport of Lunch-Florida with a couple of coworkers, when suddenly a lightning struck the plane from the rainy skies.
The lightning force threw the machine into the land of Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns around his body.
My father called me and said my brother got an electric shock and he is in the hospital.
I asked if he was alive," says Austin's sister Autumn.
Austin spent two weeks at the hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and cerebral hemorrhage.
The experience was tough for the whole family.
It can't wait.
It’s traumatizing for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the case and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and reinvigorates business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when starting a new restructuring program in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and early 2019, and the company already reduced 4 000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by £300 million in May as part of his third savings program, which aims to revive the business that has deteriorated as a result of rapid digitisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in the Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, who announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged. Its net sales increased by one per cent to EUR 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Slap to convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide strike
The suicide bomber struck the military escort in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and according to the authorities, the strike was killed by a NATO soldier and several others were wounded.
According to NATO’s opinion, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the blow.
According to unverified local data, three civilians also died in the Qarabagh region in Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent blow in Afghanistan this month, on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died at a suicide bomber's blow at the Embassy of Iraq in Kabul.
According to NATO’s opinion, a Thursday-Evening explosion occurred when a joint patrol of NATO and Afghanistan was subjected to an attack by an “own-made explosion device” carried by a person.
The statement stated that the condition of all injured persons was stable and were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1 662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the autobomb killed at least 30 people in suicide attacks in Kabul, where mainly Shia Muslims live.
Taliban announced that he was behind the blow.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in a bomb attack, which was the most devastating militant group attack in the country after U.S.-led troops defeated the Taliban in 2001.
Violence underlines the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send more troops to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks of recent weeks in Kabul have also significantly weakened people’s trust in government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA turns its decision to postpone the implementation of smoke mist regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce emissions during Obama’s administrative period after 15 states had sued the Office.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called ‘ozone definitions’ in late Wednesday, showing its commitment to cooperation with states.
We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of states,” said Director Scott Pruitt in the opinion of the agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Agency to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions for one year for October 2018, according to which smoke mist pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with increasingly strict air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the Office sued 15 countries, mainly governed by the Democrats, including the District of Columbia, which found that the postponement of execution was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama, according to Trump, the measures are part of a broader economic growth programme.
Trump’s measures have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists concerned about the health impacts of the increase in emissions.
According to EPA’s website, breathing air containing ozone “can weaken the functioning of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a member of the ISIS leaders had also sent to Sydney bomb builds.
Suspects suggest that the bomb was supposed to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police will not tell you more about why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device that emits toxic colorless gas and to take the device to a crowded public place, for example in a public transport system.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One man has been released, but his interrogations are also continued.
Neste’s CEO: Renewable fuels performed well
Oil refiner Neste’s profit before taxes decreased, but lost the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company achieved a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products reached a record level, and the operating profit development in the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit improved the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favorable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and have already announced strategic investments in 2017, Lievonen said in a press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match of the 66.7-pound series in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel office in Los Angeles until WBC’s invincible lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked along the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the master of the WBO’s upper featherweight.
At Showtime on Saturday, Garcia won the former four weighted world champions Adrien Broner by unanimous decision, after which Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five in the list of weighted boxers.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and asked, “How is it, master?
Good luck in a match!”
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel on seven Saturdays.
When the two posed to the photographers, Lomachenko’s manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the match between men would be “perfect in terms of sizes”.
I’m a former feather set,” Garcia reminded.
I moved up the series [63.5 pounds] for Broner, but I’m not so big.
I am compact to 63.5 kg.
I want back to the light series.
He has to rise to the light series [61.2 kilos], then we can fight.
That’s what our fans hope for.
Let’s fulfill their wishes.”
Lomachenko agreed.
Boxing needs this match.”
Klimas asked if the match should be held on a payment channel, which is part of his strategy for Lomachenko, according to which Lomachenko debuted later this year in the light series and competes against Garcia (37–0, 30 knockout victories next summer). Garcia would also be interested in the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell play in the light series Forum on 23 September.
The match could be on a payment channel because fans have asked for it,” Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to match on a channel that offers the best prize package.
We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
For me, it is right when I get to an agreement...”
Garcia said she appreciates Lomachenko as an “amazing fighter” and might be going to watch a Saturday match.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's praise and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked “truly slow. Sori, Mike... but you needed its knockout.”
Garcia said she focused first on showing the impact and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that they wanted the match between them to be carried out more and more strongly.
This is the match that is expected.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I’m definitely involved in this story,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was expecting to fight the best. “Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.”
Average salary 5 300 euros, training what happens - the situation of investment advice had been "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot recently.
Lastly, Helsingin Sanomat told about Ritva, 68, to whom the banker’s investment advisor spoke a full bunny when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and various sales of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will be applied at the beginning of next year.
At the moment, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify competence requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that the investment firm perform its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
Finance Finland has authorised the organisation of degrees to a firm called APV Investment Examinations Ltd, whose working group includes experts from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and other actors in the field.
The degrees are 12-15 ECTS credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, a company providing business management development services, Aalto University Executive Education Ltd.
On its website, it is said that in general, both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The studies include 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Examinations Ltd, says that the pass rate of exams is roughly approximately 70.
Of the largest banks’ staff, all investment firms have completed either an APV1 or APV2 degree, because their completion is mandatory according to the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller banker movements without mentioning names whose staff seem to have mapped out the completion of the degrees, Savikko says.
According to him, there are "a few" banker shops like this.
According to Savikko, the APV1 degree has been completed since 2000 by 13 000-14 000 people and more demanding APV2 degrees have been recommended to investment advisors by about 3 000 people.
Some banking companies consider the degree to be an advantage.
Several other sectors have significantly stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Sector’s recommendation requires the completion of APV degrees, because this is when the expertise related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of regular working hours for monthly pay is approximately EUR 5 300.
Men working in positions earn over EUR 5 900 per month on average and women over EUR 4 500 respectively.
The tenth of the most earners earn an average of around EUR 8 100.
The tenth of men who earn the most will earn more than €9 000 per month or more, the tenth of women who earn the most will earn €6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
Until now, the employee and task level has been trusted in self-regulation.
According to Fiva, the inspection was carried out in individual cases where the investment advisor’s expertise and qualifications were not sufficient based on the advice’s activities.
In principle, it is also possible to act as a seller of investment products, even if the expertise and qualifications are at a low level.
In principle, the situation in this regard has been wild and free.
Several other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements,” Savikko says.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year, the new MiFID II Financial Markets Directive will provide stricter results.
It requires that every company is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
The FIN-FSA, on the other hand, has the power to determine what needs to be done.
Fiva’s market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current regulation is the requirements concerning the expertise and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to Hovi, the new requirements concern both the personnel of investment firms and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to a proposal from the Board of Directors of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is authorised to determine competence and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided in these cases during the coming autumn.
In the future, the company must also take care of the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and continuing education.
All of this must be documented, and the company is obliged to demonstrate that this has also been done.
Hovi specifies that in practice, the company must, for example, map out the personnel’s job descriptions at the individual level.
There are certainly different requirements for this depending on whether it is investment advice or sales of products.
According to Hovi, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline if the competence or experience is not at an adequate level.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a specific person who meets the criteria.
According to Hovi, the rules are tightened and concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will become more stringent at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra’s tenacious beach swimming schools do not stop rain or sunburn - Iines Kaikkonen pedals persistently with the help of a swimming trunk
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools will run in Slytherin and Lempukka this and next week.
Although sometimes it rains and then shines again, young swimmers are not in the mox, praises Taina Itkonen, the leader of swimming schools.
In this week’s swimming schools, there will be a total of 13 children, a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that the school and the preschool already begin, says Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised in cooperation by the Sports Unit project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere on the beach of Slytherin.
The sun was shining and young swimming school students trained to stay on the surface with the swimming sticks, someone without them.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Daisy from Kaikko, 5, first thought deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to pedal towards the beach.
Greatly goes!
Iines Kaikkonen said he had been swimming a lot this summer.
Sludge beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too get to be satisfied with today’s achievements, swimming opulently praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted some water wars.
Ilona Villberg, her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, who followed the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for swimming.
Even though the weather has been what hurts, Anna has liked to go here every day.
Sometimes we had to warm up.
Swimming schoolchildren packed on the pier.
The boys were busy with the frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snapped fruits and bake the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no rush at the pier.
That’s what doesn’t belong to summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here is such a connecting story"
All kinds of it can see.
Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier range a couple of days ago.
So dish brushes and laundry racks - as well as a "toilet brush with a border brush".
The unknown soldier refers to the film and film marketing, which will be premiered in the autumn.
Still, there is something special about the combination, and the products have been grinned on social media: When will future Unknown Health Bonds?
You have to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does Sinituote’s Deputy CEO Aino Määttä say?
We are a film partner.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support Finnish production and cult film, Määttä says.
According to him, the products become a special illegitimate in stores, and thus the film gains visibility.
Isn't there something funny here - often when you think that the products and the related stories have something in common?
Yes, this is a story that we are a Finnish company and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are profitable by those who have seen the Old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to military culture, Määttä points out.
Other corporate partners in the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, Hartwall’s Vichys have been launched, for example, as well as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products already had time to run the Finnish Picture Magazine blog Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and bells are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still a continuation.
Among the unknown partners, Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl have not yet revealed their war products, Kinnunen writes.
New results of age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were published
The latest results of Swedish asylum seekers’ medical age tests have been published. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that over 80% of the people tested were over 18 years of age, but not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Agency for Legal Medicine started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to assess the age of the asylum seeker in more detail, and the new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of the applicants claiming to be underage.
The Finnish Immigration Service has conducted 6 880 tests so far, and the Finnish Judicial Medicines Agency has now published the results of the 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Of the tests, 80%, i.e. 2002, the asylum seeker was determined to be over 18 years of age, and in the case of 25, the Finnish Judicial Medicines Agency determined that the test was ‘possibly 18 years of age or older’.
In the 432 case, it was decided that the asylum seeker is ‘possibly under the age of 18’.
The tests were conducted only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Agency for Legal Medicine says that the results are consistent with previous months’ results.
The figures are quite consistent, and there are no big differences in the statistics of the previous months,” he told The Local.
Although most applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that the applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 test and announced that 442 cases had ‘refer to the fact that the study is 18 years of age or older’.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that 243 cases had been openly reported that the applicant would turn 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee joints, then the dentists and radiologists analyse the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute Claude Marcus, whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people, which can be used to determine whether a person has reached a puberty earlier or later than usual.
I have had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not the right one.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we certainly can’t determine age, we shouldn’t pretend to be able to do it,” he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is the largest in a situation where the test subject will soon turn 18 and the risk will be about 10 per cent.”
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
In the third round, Mikko Ilonen’s 30th place in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland was held with a strip of results.
Ilonen left number 11 on Saturday day, but at the end of the tour there was 41.
In the difficult weather, Ilonen was accompanied by three bogs, one double bog.
Others also had a hard time.
The English Ian Poulter got to share a top spot in one of the under-par rounds, even though he told me that the umbrella had plenty of work to do.
The weather was raw, but I was hanging around and finally the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the top position with his compatriots Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia to change party
Jim Justice, Governor of West Virginia, announced on Thursday night at the Trump campaign event that he was switching parties.
The democrats simply rejected me,” said Justice.
Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection... Today I tell the West Virginians that I can’t help you anymore as a governor of the Democrats.”
The audience burst into raging applause.
Tomorrow, as a member of the Republican Party," added Justice.
As a coach, I’d tell you it’s time for a new game.”
Trump previously promised that a significant announcement will be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points, as the Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice was elected governor in 2016. He is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is valued at around $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published an opinion that “the Governor Justice Party is again a new blow to a democratic party that would rather build obstacles than a better America.”
The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before, and in this case, the Justice’s announcement is the latest back to a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive message that unites people,” Ronna McDaniel, RNC’s representative, said in a statement to the news from CBS.
Flashes sown damage - Thursdays are coming even summer very thunderous day
At the end of the week, more thunderstorms will also be brought to Southern Finland.
During the past week, especially in the middle and northern parts of the country, and in the region of Southwest Finland, have been frightened.
Between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes lit up several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may become a very thunderous day of the summer so far.
Thunderstorms have finally also found Finland.
During the past week, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland have been lightning.
On the table, lightning struck the power center of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a notification of the fire for about a quarter of an hour on Wednesday of midnight.
The electricity centre was located in a sauna at the end of a terraced house.
The rescue department dismantled the roof and wall to find fire pits and extinguished the fire rapidly.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
In Loimaa, the lightning lit up the outer building on Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue department arrived, the building was already at the full stage of the fire, and the rescue department could only prevent the fire from spreading.
The outer building, about fifty square meters, burned down to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, in Rääkkylä, lightning struck the house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flaming lightning strike.
The rescue department visited the scene to check the case, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses spurred.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the fault was received between eight and nine on Thursday morning, after which trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was only fixed a little before five in the afternoon.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally with a track section that was hit by thunder.
Flashes have sown destruction in different parts of Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively minor this summer.
This summer’s thunderstorms have been deadly! assess the Finnish Meteorological Institute’s on-call meteorologist Jari Tuovinen.
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been mainly moderate in strength, but thanks to the low lightning balance of the summer, it also feels many even strong.
This might seem like a real thunderstorm, but that’s what it has been compared to this summer’s thunderstorm,” Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the country lightning flew 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential even for the toughest thunder day of the summer: by about 16 a.m., there were 1,790 country lightnings in the plaque.
If the lightning continues towards the early evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weak lightning year was experienced in 2015, when the flash volume of the year was about 30 000.
By Wednesday, this year’s flash volume had risen to 18 386 flashes.
So there is still something to be apprehended so that this year does not break the "highscore" from two years ago.
However, the Ukkosir can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a suitable environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunderstorms will shift to Saturday from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where the days of about 2 000 lightning can be obtained on both Saturday and Sunday.
There will be a more uniform rain front in the central parts of the country.
In such cases, Tuovinen says that only rarely thunders.
Coe praises Russia’s “open-minded” apology for doping scandal
The world athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he had described as open-minded, which Russia made on Thursday due to the doping scandal, but he added that it was not yet time to stop Russia’s ban on participation.
Russian athletics director Dmitri Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday, which was held on the eve of the World Championships, that the Russian ban is appropriate and that he intends to fight doping determinedly.
He said he was sorry for all the athletes who took the gold or silver medal in the competitions.
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban, and Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA report presented evidence of state-subsidised doping in Russia.
I think his response today was very direct, it was a very open-minded presentation,” said Coe, President of the IAAF, to the journalists.
The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation acknowledged that the country had undergone difficult times and announced that it was doing its utmost to reorganise its activities.”
Coe said he was “satisfied” with the fact that Russia also accepted the terms and conditions of the closure of the ban.
I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but the congress supports the working group’s recommendation that it is not the right time to stop Russia’s ban,” Coe said.
In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the depraved system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete on neutral athletes’ status in the World Athletics Championships starting on Friday in London and have met the strict IAAF criteria.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
The testing is still insufficient, and the non-exempt coaches still operate freely,” he told the journalists on Friday after a presentation by the IAAF to the Council in London.
Production company disappointed in the weak success of Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film did not become such a success as the creators hoped, says Yle.
If honestly said, I am disappointed, acknowledge that the film was produced by Helsinki Film’s CEO Annika Sucksdorff Yle’s interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100 000 viewers, which is a little bit compared to the film’s budget of about five million euros.
There was no lottery win for this, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been more successful in Finland, they would have already received their money.
Now you have to wait for small creases of foreign spreads, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect the Neymar transfer to Paris
The regulations restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from transferring Spain from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, which is the most expensive player transfer ever made.
Its potential for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) is decided by the UEFA regulation of European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA adopted the rules of fair play, which require PSG to demonstrate that Neymar’s transfer has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros for terminating the Brazilian contract, and Neymar’s annual salary in the new club moves in tens of millions of dollars.
Neymar’s transfer to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar’s transfer and attaching him to its star ring, as it is followed by financing the Qatari oil-enriched regime.
Clubs are allowed to use large sums to purchase players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that the business related to football is not loss-making.
The rules for fair play were drawn up as President of UEFA at the initiative of the French Michel Plat in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was a scam and led to serious problems if banks or owners pulled their support.
In 2011, the focus of the financial rules of fair play shifted from the liabilities of clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly complicated, and Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge amounts on player purchases, and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of fair play financial rules lasts until 2018, during which the clubs can make a maximum loss of EUR 30 million.
Although Platini was forced to leave UEFA presidential positions scandalously in 2015, his successor Alexander Ceferin also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
The rules of fair play are still in use and we will continue to apply them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the financial rules of fair play in UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although the PSG paid out Neymar with a lump sum, it can accrue the amount in the bookkeeping for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has made a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as a 44.4 million euro annual expense for the next five years.
On the basis of the fair play economic rules, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which is financed from Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was ordered to limit the Champions League to 21 players for the 2014–2015 season instead of the regular 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies associated with the club’s owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the support is considered to be higher than usual in the market, UEFA will not calculate the support as the actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority’s support for PSG was oversized.
It has also become clear that some of Neymar’s contributions to PSG could be financed by fees available from Qatar’s 2022 World Cup Organising Commission.
However, the PSG and the Organising Committee have banned Neymar from making a World Cup ambassador, making it very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to PSG’s previous sanctions, UEFA will follow companies to go around the rules even more closely than usual.
Sources from the situation reported on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG to transfer Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identity is not disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015–2016 totalled EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last season have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase the sales of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its net sales will increase by at least 30 per cent with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly annoyed by the world’s best player’s departure, tried to complicate Neymar’s move, which was claimed to be a violation of the financial rules of fair play.
This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state,” said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal’s manager Arsene Wenger also holds a reservation for the state to fund the activities of the football club, which is owned by the American sports tycoon.
The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the operating environment of football over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
There are so many interests associated with a famous player representing the state that it will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of fair play.”
Now is the rush: Finland’s World Cup athlete coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three jumper Kristiina Mäkelä’s coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should coach at the World Athletics Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach’s advice.
Pajulahti competes tomorrow in long jump qualification and Mäkelä on Saturday in three jump qualification.
However, the duo’s coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the issue in the UK's broadcast without any results.
The coach has the invitation of the organisers of the World Cup as a document, but it is also not valid for obtaining a visa.
Whether this is the first Brexit symptoms, or what, says Jorma Kemppainen, Director of Coaching.
He has always managed visa issues himself successfully, but now there are some problems.
He does everything to get to the place.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn’t matter that much.
As long as someone watches the steps in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said about the possible leave of his coach.
World Championship medal for Finland from London demands a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics start today in London on Friday and last until the end of the week on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Sure, there are other metrics.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one competition to another, where by acquiring experience, the athlete’s performance is matured to the level that the World Championship for Adults is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland’s small World Cup team, or even veterans.
The World Championship Medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sports is that miracles can also happen.
It draws the bench athletes to the TV screen and glues to follow the races, even though London’s medals are solved due to the time difference only at night late.
Of the previous World Athletics Championships in Athletics, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The braves are waiting for the medal from Pitkämäki even now, even though the second one tells the results of his and other shooters last time and how to qualify for the last summer’s value competition.
Went to these competitions however, Pitkämäki remains in history as a big Finnish sports hero.
Accessing the final competition or making your own record is good enough for other Finnish athletes.
Hope and believe in the realistic medal hunt of the future years of Finnish athletics will be a good success in the international competitions for young people this summer.
Raising young talent and supporting its work is more important than maintaining a small elite team of represented athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London races will remain in history as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah races, not because of, for example, the fear of terrorism or cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But yes annoying"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place on Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi’s best big air world cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson from the United States.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump at the caballerial 1080 for the first time in a race, and it was very close to succeed.
It feels good and a good feeling is now, but it’s annoying that the last jump didn’t go quite.
I’m going to try again from now on,’ said Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the racer jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line’s new express ship froze at the port in Helsinki
The new fast-track vessel FSTR by the shipping company Viking is badly delayed.
The speedboat had to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 18.
Eight countries were loading on board.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
At least one and a half hours I have been waiting for you to board the ship.
Now the car queue is moving a little, John Rebane, who waits for boarding at the Port of Helsinki, told us at 19.30.
Rebane thought that the new vessel had become a technical fault.
Rebane told that the shipping company had brought water bottles for those waiting in their cars.
Viking’s Communications Manager Christa Grönlund says to IS that a technical failure came to the end.
It was repaired in the Port of Helsinki.
The vessel departs from Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed for a couple of hours from the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship had to leave from Tallinn to Helsinki at 20.15.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Kuutositie Thursday night

The police guide traffic on the Kuusitie road, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From Mälkiä, the transport will proceed along road 13 to Mustola harbour.
Minor Circuit nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story is adored at the same time by the 80s grunge characters and the 90s grunge (then David Wain and Michael Showter made the great State sketch series for MTV) and their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars in the series moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memory that we have stuck with in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have already lived its time.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (it was said, among other things, that H. Jon Benjamin's voice-speaking vegetable can's background story).
At the core of the joke is that middle-aged actors play a lustful teenager approaching adulthood, and highlighting it makes it impossible to reach the past a part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodies 90s stalker films, such as the horror movie The Hand that swings every cradle.
At one point, one of the characters dig up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates, and “change stuff from 1991”.
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in a crazy plot, Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) is involved in a crime companion George H. W. Bush (shown by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such sets, the best are the side paths.
It’s especially fun to see the ever-young Paul Rudd, who has under the lower lip a beard pom-pom, or Matt Dillon’s “soul patch” from the film Singles.
The moments of random madness may bring this series to flight as a recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later, and in its final scene, the group of friends goes to the premiere of the Wet Hot American Summer movie.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series appeals to another kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of the Americans series, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series’ wrestling imagery, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas and is made into a Romanian 1980s police drama, in which a Bucharest-based couple fight for truth, atheism and marsism-leninism.
Starring Gregoria and Iosefina as the idealist, they are seen by Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici, whose turn has been dubbed by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But much more, then it is not.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the policemen spend time watching chess from the TV in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, who will be able to play a game of fun.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught in the imitation of a clumsy social drama – including a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, which is why the series often starts to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
The six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is neither fast enough nor abundant.
In summary, the series might work better as a agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby grumbling burgers.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: as a turta, we devoured our own recent history and their history.
Kouvola-based Toni Tauru rises to the ring in Macau on Saturday - faced with a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match up.
Toni Tauru receives a hard bone in Macau, as the Brazilian Leandro Issa was still in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also has a jujutsu black belt and a world championship of the sport.
For once I am against a parent.
It’s a fun thing,” says 32-year-old Tauru.
Kouvolalainen had to rise to the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistic problems, but three battles were made on a quick schedule in China’s self-government area in Macau.
Tauru hasn’t met with that before.
This was the first time my match was cancelled.
It irritated, as preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the fighter is pleased to have a new time for the fight.
Waiting for a week does not have much effect on preparation.
The transfer will not affect the condition, as it will not improve in a week.
It can get worse if you train too much.
In a few of his previous struggles, Taurus has faced opponents whose strengths are in vertical combat.
This time, the situation is different.
Issaa from Kouvola describes a typical Brazilian.
He is a rather aggressive fighter.
I guess he will come on hard in the first installment and try to take to the carpet.
He has won the jujutsu World Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The previous match of Kouvolalainen did not go as planned.
Kevin Belingon of the Philippines beat Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I have never played so well, especially: he was not hit at all.
When I went down, he hit my eye.
It was really annoyed for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some go into the ring more frequently.
For example, the future opponent Issa last fought in September.
Last year, there were three matches in Tauru.
Now the second battle of this year is ahead.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
In recent years, I have trained and been in good shape all the time.
However, I have only played for the reason of the match.
When the 32 year old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was working out in Espoo and got back the joy of doing things.
We got really good workouts with one guy from Sweden too.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday a Kouvola resident has to prepare for a physical struggle.
I’ve been able to train against the same-sized opponents and practice a standing match.
Upright is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to beat sensibly.
If there is an event, I will go to the plot myself.
It is not allowed to give down-exports for free, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who was previously in China.
It’s heard of China’s Las Vegas.
I believe that there is a big and fine evening in front.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged once economic growth has been vigorous and inflation has stopped speculation on interest rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow and the bank shifted interest rate hikes, as the income level of families is under increasing pressure.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent.The interest rate hike received less support this month, as economic growth has been poor.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6%, and warned that the income level of households is still under pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rate hikes will be needed in the next few years to curb the inflation rate boosted by Brexit, and the Bank also announced that borrowing costs may have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive economic package, which was implemented in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum a year ago.
The bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to offer a total of £15 million more financial funding to banks through the programme, totalling 115 million.
The Bank’s interest rate decision states: “According to the forecast by the Committee responsible for monetary policy, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the next few years, as the decline in real household income will reduce consumption.”
In terms of interest rates, the bank reiterated the need for ‘some degree of tightening of monetary policy’ to curb inflation ‘more broadly’ market expectations.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second one in 2020.
However, the bank emphasised that potential increases are ‘gradual’ and ‘limited’.
In May, the bank forecasted an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and a growth of 1.7 per cent for next year.
Now it kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound deteriorated in relation to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound declined by 0.5 per cent to $1.31, down by 0.4 per cent to EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker than expected growth figures subdued the higher expectations of interest rate hikes, while GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation report gave little hope for households suffering from accelerating inflation and low pay rises, according to the bank, the situation will deteriorate even before it becomes better.
The bank added that monetary policy ‘cannot prevent’ income decline in the next few years, but expects that wage development will recover ‘significantly’ at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound, which will overturn part of the impact of a decline in private consumption.
The decision was made one year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shocked EU referendum, which plunged the pound into decline.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will likely only be reflected in prices and in the economy after four years.
Before the Central Bank’s latest decision, interest rate hikes had started to be demanded more and more loudly as inflation tightened the pressure on households, and three decision-makers demanded 0.5 per cent interest rate hikes in July.
Last month, inflation fell from 2.6% in June to 2.6%, but the bank reported that it was expected and inflation tightened again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, its 2% target level was ‘fully’ due to a weak pound.
Taking into account the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the housing loan market seems to be tightening even further when lenders are feverishly seeking customers and wanting to end the year strongly,” says Andrew Montlake, Executive Vice President of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is about to end, and renewal agreements are becoming more popular, their interest rates are low, and there are also consumer-free options.”
NHS prescribes 10 000 controversial HIV drugs
From September onwards, patients can be prescribed a ‘revolutionary’ HIV blocker, and the Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the funding of the drug in the English public health system (NHS).
The NHS announced that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) treatment is prescribed to approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year trial, and that the pre-mixed drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86 percent on individuals at high risk.
The NHS agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal held the Supreme Court’s judgment last year, according to which the NHS is able to pay for the drug PrEP, although it is alleged that it should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS on Thursday, called the announced decision a “significant new intervention”, and the national AIDS organisation described it as “solving for an important moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to start receiving enrollment for a trial that expands in October to other clinics, reaching its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) treatment is a pre-units HIV drug that reduces the risk of infection.
The tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
Before intercourse, the drug means that there are enough drugs in the body during sexual intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with a HIV-positive partner who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics select candidates who meet the criteria for the trial from men, women and transgender, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in the treatment of a general practitioner can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and this week the NHS signed a contract for medicines after the international tendering process.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of the PrEP drug by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementation of treatment.
This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV,” says Stevens.
That’s another remarkable achievement in over 30 years of fighting to solve humanity’s biggest health challenge.”
This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” says Deborah Gold, head of the national AIDS organization.
If PrEP medication is targeted correctly at those in need and those in risk groups, it can have a pivotal impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, people in the risk group will receive a drug through an NHS-funded trial, the use of which they can independently decide without the need to negotiate with a partner, and it will have an empowering effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news.”
Now, the most important thing is to ensure that the trial is quickly launched in the whole country and no one in the risk group is excluded from it,” says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
The PrEP drug used in the trial has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people belonging to risk groups from HIV infection.”
The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that was prolonged unnecessarily in several months due to the slowdown of the government,” says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health at the shadow government.
We have evidence that medicine can have a revolutionary impact on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment helps us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get a step closer to the situation where HIV has been successfully halted.”
Quality of living: the intermediate floor and smart interior design have made the small Earl’s Court’s apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who was interested in real estate renovation, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl’s Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna’s style house, and the success of the renovation is explained by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her closets and moved.
Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a significantly larger apartment,” Joanne says.
I was looking for something similar in my price range.
I visited here on the apartment screen and noticed that the rooms were as high as then in my apartment.
I fell in love right away and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete makeover.
It was a two-room apartment with access to the bedroom only from the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to make use of the room height.
I wanted space, large windows and lots of light.
They were my requirements,” he says.
He hired a Duck & Shed design agency in Notting Hill, Erfan, who was tasked with taking advantage of the space of almost four meters high rooms and creating an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale site but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where there was room for standing.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
Steel structures are quite complex.
The facilities had to be arranged on top of each other so that there is no need to crouch in them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right both on and below them.”
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms on top of the space with fascinating details.
On the intermediate floor opens the copper-crossed window of Retrouvius to the elegant living area.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings a sense of theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make it seem really longer.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window overlooking another room.
The mirror-covered furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne’s cutlery and glassware.
The elegance is enhanced by the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But Joanne's kitchen is unique in that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
It required a bit of design,” Erfan says with a steel-reinforced MDF door.
”It’s balanced, so it slides in very easily when lifting.”
Thanks to the sensible use of space and the design of the storage space, Joanne received 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and an even better layout.
When selling an apartment, the area is determined – or the appreciation of the property,” Erfan says.
In the basic case, the real estate agent walks in to the apartment and calculates the price based on the area.”
Joanne’s apartment area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
The resident is in contact with the materials in the apartment, and the emotional bond with the apartment is partly based on them,” Erfan says.
No one attaches to the electrical wiring on the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example that good design and extra square metres can make a basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant princess Sofia radiated in her summer look
Princess Sofia's choice of outfit hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia represented at the event with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad of Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented in the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue body-tight outfit that gorgeously dressed the latest pregnant princess.
Sofia came to an event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representation in which Sofia represents before birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For the dinner at the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastel blue dressed nicely as a princess.
Sofia has been in Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia filled her outfit with a little bag.
Sofia radiated in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got excited at the event to talk to photographers.
Now I’m just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referring to her final pregnancy.
She breeds us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a stall was opened in Lahti Market Square, where Thai food was sold.
The Lahtins did not dare to taste, but walked past.
The food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the acquaintances Panja.
He did not know much Finnish, nor did he know Thai at that time.
As the crowds didn’t dare to go and eat, Panja offered free tastings.
Thus he taught the people of Lahti to eat Thai food, spring roll at a time.
Taste the taste," he said.
I got hooked from the law.
I visited more and more often, in the end every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai restaurant in Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and places limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
Little by little we got to know better and we became friends.
Eventually, I sat by the plate with the dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went on the side of the market hall, but then the restaurant had to change, because the homemade spice paste would smell too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the market hall.
There is room.
Now we braces can sit at our own tables again, only during the busiest times we have to shyly ask the guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows her customers.
He is told the news where has been and who has been seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how the customers’ life stages vary and the food company changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring rolls.
She remembers me lean and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It is nice to go for lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own place next to the kitchen door and change the belongings with Panja leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many talk to him Thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Although he has had a hard time, he is always friendly.
He is diligent.
On top of the restaurant work, he visits a mushroom and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant was celebrating its two decades of fullness.
We customers got strawberry cake as a dessert.
Without noise or attention went this remarkable day, at work.
The discovery from the historical base revealed 173 Isis terrorists ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a list that is significant for counter-terrorism work.
The list includes data from over 170 Isis fighters ready to attack Europe.
According to the German magazine Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data but also pictures of everyone.
There are over 130 Iraqis listed on the list, but there are also six Europeans.
They are from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest is from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat shared a list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been specified.
According to the paper, the Iraqi army special forces found a list of terrorist personal data and images when studying the terrorist organization’s underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The reason was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists as ISIS collapsed in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all people, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person’s home country.
The list also lists the specialties of terrorists.
For example, under German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads the battle name Abu Assid al-Almani, i.e. German.
He was reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later via Turkey to join the ranks of Isis.
A suicide bomber has been written next to his picture.
There is no more detailed information about the fate of a man.
A total of 6 000 fighters have left Europe and there is no certainty about their fate.
Man sank under the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on the rescue department’s interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
A bucket can also save the drowning spirit.
A person who had fallen underwater on Thursday was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, the firefighter on duty at the rescue department of Helsinki, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water for about 15 minutes after notification.
The diver of the rescue department found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue department received a notification after half four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the hands of emergency care.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander praises the cooperation between the Finnish Border Guard and the police.
This was a task led by the Finnish Border Guard.
The divers were also excellently guided by the divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars crashed in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured

The brothers fight for more than $500 million of real estate assets
Two brothers argue about Victoria’s largest real estate empire, worth more than $500 million, which is related to a family business founded by their Italian family members 40 years ago.
Colin De Lutis, former chairman and real estate developer of Carlton football club, lives in the Torak value area just three houses from his younger brother Paulista, the younger brother has brought the highest court over the division of real estate and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the difference.
The brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 properties worth more than half a billion and the family started accumulating property when they bought a deal on Collingwood’s Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban malls.
According to the agreement with the deceased father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about one-third of the company’s assets. Paul describes his father as “the carrying force of the family and the central figure”.
According to court documents, the asset allocation ratio means that Colin owns approximately USD 316 million in real estate and Paul approximately USD 176 million in real estate.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
”I think Colin left the best properties in his proposal for himself,” Paul wrote in his first sworn certificate to the court in 2015.
The case was last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
The brothers now also argue about who manages the existing business, Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
According to Colin, the claim is not true; he blames Paul for the poor care of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first sworn testimonies that he would like to get to the solution.
According to our Italian traditions, the family is the most important to me,” Colin says in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of statements, e-mails and reports, and the case is being investigated by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the best and most experienced experts in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicatessens in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin founded the family’s first denim store.
Colin says that he founded the store “in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (approximately 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons in a suitable manner.
Luigi often said that he doesn’t want brothers to come to court,” Anna writes in her statement.
The two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of the De Lutis Group, according to Colin, who received $10 million and $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are ‘bitter about the economic conditions of their departure’.
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former member of the Australian Football League Club and the best friend of TV star Eddie McGuire according to this 2015 biographies.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutsi and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, saying in his text message that it is not possible to comment on the matter correctly, because it is handled in court.
It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and, according to our family’s name, lead me to a court fight,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had attempted to agree to his brother's demands.
Our father wouldn’t have wanted us to argue this way,” Colin continued and said that he still hoped that the solution would be made.
On Friday, the hope seemed to have gone out.
Our case will be settled in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new HR manager intends to restrict the President’s media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly finally succeeds.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the new HR manager of the White House plans to restrict President Trump’s media use and news monitoring so that the boss won’t get so often into trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
When the new HR manager of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with the management staff on his first working day, he talked about the key problem that he is going to solve: he intends to restrict President Donald Trump’s access to information.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information – whether printed or heard at press conferences – must be passed through her because the President makes better decisions when getting good information.”
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump’s media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relationship with TV – and as president, he still looks at a lot of TV.
If presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media handled things more equally,” Sam Nunberg, who worked as advisor in the Trump campaign, told Politico in February.
According to six former campaign workers, Tara Palmeri, Politico’s editor, wrote that “it is essential to manage the use of Trump’s Twitter that his personal media flow will include a steady stream of praise”.
Clear.
But it is ridiculous to argue that using Trump’s Twitter would have ever been under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something we don’t know – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We probably never get to know what kind of messages Trump didn’t send.
If even a few times his staff have been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been futile.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing turmoil.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House trying to drive their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their vision, which can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisors intentionally provide the President with relevant information.
Editor Shane Goldmacher explained one case:
Trump’s current and former employees say that he can be exasperated by newspaper clips where he is judged, especially if he is told about malicious data leaks, so he has to know where the data comes from.
That was the end of February when someone mischievously provided the president with a copy of the news from GotNews.com, founded by internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Assistant Staff Manager Katie Walsh of multiple White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and cancelled them later, and he did not provide concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started reading the story after asking the staff about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then HR manager Reince Priebus and White House HR Secretary Rob Porter “had tried to implement a document management system for Trump.”
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same three months later.
Perhaps he proves to be a more efficient leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still driving their own things.
These unaltered facts make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, says the news agency AFP.
Previously, on Thursday evening, Neymar’s representatives had paid the buy-out price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, a player in the Spanish league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been dissolved, and he was free to move to the Parisian society PSG.
The staggering EUR 222 million transfer amount is the largest in soccer history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million for French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatari company.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelafi from Qatar.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen overcome alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm in the shape of my life"
Raija Oranen, a successful writer known for his 69th birthday, spent time in the TV series.
Hypnosis helped Raija Oras.
In addition to writing, five grandchildren keep their grandmothers so that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola’s apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now the rental apartment also left in the spring.
To the light and to the sun, out of the old circles, Raijan once took depression and alcoholism that he has survived.
The external appearance is also 20 kilograms lighter.
Weight started to drop when serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood pills.
I got help with alcoholism once from hypnosis, which also tricked into fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, a radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I can better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked on tourism, have been working together for over 40 years.
I asked, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
He has always been such a queen of drama, he has ended his life there, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has made a great career as a writer, remembers only a good 44-piece Clear White Sheets TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided that the company was a clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä’s 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing shop and sometimes I was a mannequin,” Oranen recalls.
From him, the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and dissertation revealed it, says Oranen.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer of active time, she has many manuscripts under work - ideas for hundreds.
The vagabonds returned over the ditch to “the millionaires’ alley”
One of the most wealthy owners of the Western Midlands is again on the rivets with the stubborn orbiters, who managed to cross the ditch that the municipality needed and return to the field next to the houses.
The tourers parked their twenty caravans near a street called a millionaires’ alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that the municipality needed as a means of transport, bringing with them children, horses and the army of vans.
The vasculars managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Infuriated residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of “perfect inability to solve the problem”.
An anonymous resident says that the vagabonds came from Bentley Heath on a Monday evening, where they had thrown passers-by on stones.
The municipality must be hardened to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The vagabonds were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them in the evening and probably even more today.”
The resident told us that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it’s frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can’t do anything about it.”
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the circulars returned so soon after they were driven away.
There are more of them, and they have even let the horse pasture in the park.”
According to Solihull’s municipal spokesperson, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road.“We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull’s police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible report disruptive or criminal activities to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings.”
Enraged people besieged Portugal's crash machine
Men who have made a forced landing on a beach full of people in Portugal have been consulted today in court.
As a result of forced landing, two people died yesterday.
Two men who fly the plane may be charged with death.
At its longest, it can provide 16 years of imprisonment in Portugal.
The mini-machine flew by men had to make a forced landing on Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon yesterday due to a technical failure.
There were hundreds of people on the beach during the event, some of whom ran a plane to escape the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The machine first hit the man who was the back of the machine.
Right after that, the machine got up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents were not injured.
Those on the beach surrounded the small machine immediately after the accident with anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the machine and began to hack it, said Celia Rocha in Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot criminal, he was desperate.
It’s a wonder that no more people are killed.
The two men in the plane were not injured by a forced landing.
The tragicly lost Finnish star once again won the World Championship gold: "I would not be a world champion without an accident"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finland’s World Championship gold early on Wednesday morning in a competition held at banked slalom in Big White, Canada.
Suur-Hamari also won the World Cross gold in the competition.
All in all, three World Championship titles have already been collected.
Time for an incredible World Cup!
Two times gold was cared for, time with a good heartbeat is drawn, the phone-reaching Suur-Hamari rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier praised his coach and a very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is growing all the time.
The whole para snowboarding has grown and developed a lot recently.
The differences are reduced, and there are a lot of new skiers involved.
Always thinks if a black horse comes from behind.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Suur-Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eagerly counting from a young age with his friends, and the accident did not want to get to the slope.
It comes to mind from time to time that what would my life be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it is pointless to miss.
The cards are used to play which are shared, says Suur-Hamari.
It would be cruel to titulate a serious misfortune and the loss of the limb into a fortune kick, and the Greater Hamari will not do it either.
But he turned a terrible difficulty to his advantage.
I would say that the situation turned into a win.
I wouldn’t be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the greatest snowboarding interest of the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar was already waning.
The job towards the top really started only after an accident.
I trained with friends when I was young, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dim somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow there at the start of X-Games.
I could not have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and thought this would be a long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sorry.
I decided to pull the overalls on my neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The skier was very pleased to choose the wheelchair-reel Leo-Pekka Tähti as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner was awarded at the sports gala held in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, the Star’s victory is an important signal for parasports people.
It was a big deal, and the victory was definitely deserved.
This will certainly open your eyes to the world of parasports as well.
When is the time to launch the athlete campaign of the year for Double World Champion Matti Suur-Hamar?
It will then be seen in time.
I try to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hamari has not yet conquered all the tops of his desire.
Next year there will be a great goal.
After a year, the Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea.
Yes, we’re going to pick up a medal!
Syrian refugee youth majority does not believe that they will return to their home country permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees frying bread at a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their home country.
Trump’s administration is not seen as bringing change to the Syrian conflict.
The communication agency chain Burson-Marsteller examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24 were responsible for the study, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
Of the respondents, 42 per cent may think that they would return to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the most impact on young people’s decision to return home is the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor for a permanent return, while the quarter believes that the most important thing would be the departure of Isis from the country.
Less than one-tenths of the Syrian economy or the departure of Bashar al-Assad are the most important factors affecting the decision.
Military measures do not solve the conflict alone
The Syrian youth was asked which factor is the most important for ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than President Bashar al-Assad’s abandonment of power.
A little over a quarter holds the presidency of al-Assad to the peace treaty.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing Syrian conflict.
To resolve the conflict through military action alone, it is only a quarter of a believer’s belief.
The majority of refugee young people in Syria see that the power of Isis has deteriorated during the last year, while the fifth sees its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important fight against the Fathers, and in general against terrorism, it is that the media convey information to people that the Fathers have nothing to do with the Islamic faith.
Nearly as many of them identified as the primary means for the reform of education and training.
According to just over a tenth, the most important thing would be to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the effects of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe that the Syrian conflict will worsen in the Trump period.
Opinions are divided in two in terms of whether Russia and Iran’s participation has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the web organized - for example, Wikipedia and Google use the database he has developed
MariaDB, a company based in Espoo, is developing an open source database for "the fastest growing" in the world.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by the coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs nothing to users and can be developed online by any proficient programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses remain organized and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they use a database of MariaDB or MySQL.
All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and even the images are linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology leader at MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely from Kauniainen takes care of the smooth operation of the internet.
Widenius developed the world’s most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later the software giant Oracle devoured Sun for 7.4 billion.
When Oracle trade took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced that they would leave.
They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't promise the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
At this point, he had already founded a company that started developing MariaDB.
He did not want his life's work to die.
I hired some twenty of the best developers from Sun and thus ensured that the continuity of the code is secured with the help of the same friends who created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop it into its own branch.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom to develop the code of MariaDB.
During MySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius says.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billionaire store, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50% per year," says MariaDB's CFO Kenneth Paqvalén.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, does not make a profit yet, and Paqvalén is a scarce word about the company’s key figures.
He reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that he will receive EUR 20 million in orders.
As the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to change databases, which can be more than a year’s contract if the customer has used a closed database.
From MySQL to MariaDB, you can do it in no time because they are versions of each other.
The Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are among the paying customers of MariaDB, among others.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
Among our customers are the world’s largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks, and even some central bank,” Paqvalén lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although Gartner’s research company has lost its market share in recent years, players such as MariaDB in net sales are still null and void, albeit fast-growing, sinters.
Approximately $50 billion in database market, open source databases do not even reach billion.
However, the open source weight cannot be measured only in cash, as most users do not pay anything for these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been changed open or at least the transition would have started.
Big companies don’t get new customers, because most of them next choose an open source.
This has resulted in license fees for commercial databases jumping into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers," Widenius says.
Since changing a closed database is cumbersome, most of the customer companies have swallowed the price increases obediently.
There are a lot of customers who are really difficult to move to because their old applications and others are in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the size of the customers is getting full.
When license fees rise every year, the customer moves sooner or later to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 percent from the previous one, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if desired.
In addition, many companies are facing major system changes when transferring their operations to the cloud.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million in loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and the intention is now to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB financing was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurements.
The company has customers in the public sector, for example, in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually from databases.
Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed by the waste of money in Finland, for example, in closed healthcare systems when open systems are cheaper, and the client is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but I think it is a better way to make code.
The community helps and does something that cannot be invented or made.
In addition to Linux developer Linus Torvalds, 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most famous open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still speak 4-5 talks every year around the world on this topic.
Italy hardens its attitude towards civil society rescue vessels
Italy has warned civil society organisations that rescue refugees from their ships in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to operate unless they commit themselves to the new rules concerning their activities.
If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue to work,” said Marco Minniti, Minister of the Interior, in an interview with the La Stampa newspaper in Turin.
Minniti's warning came on the day after the Italian authorities had confiscated the German vessel Jugend Rettett, a crew suspected of collaborating with human smugglers that promoted illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, the aid organisation refused to comment on the detailed charges of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us, and we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area,” the organisation announced in a statement published on social media.
We can only assess the accusations once we have collected all the necessary information and can assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had observed the Iuventa platform of the Jugend Rettett association since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken refugees by boat load directly from human smugglers who regained access to the boats.
One such case is claimed to have occurred only a couple of kilometres from the Libyan coast, which is reflected in the prosecutor’s document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian coast guard, who oversees rescue operations in the area, and the enthusiasm for helping is considered a motive.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue activities have agreed to follow the Code of Conduct so far: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who announced on Thursday that they consider the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause ‘significant changes or obstacles’ to the organisation’s rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to comply with the Code of Conduct, the Nobel Prize laureate is the Doctors Without Borders organisation.
Minniti, on the other hand, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has dropped sharply in recent weeks, as evidenced by the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with local mayors began to produce results.
In recent days, light has started to appear at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He revealed that the plan is to continue discussions with Libyan Mayors on economic development projects this month, as well as with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees going towards Europe.
Seasonal workers suspected of killing their common-law spouse at Enontekiö, suspect found in the terrain - a story for the prosecutor
The suspected crime took place in Kuttanen, Enontekiö last December.
According to the police, a Czech 36-year-old man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
Previously, it has been reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told that the suspect would have escaped with two dogs to the terrain after his or her act.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and he did not resist when caught.
The accusation in the case must be raised within less than a week.
The case may still be addressed in the Lapland District Court during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and all-Hairy Friends, is dead
British actress Robert Hardy is dead at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced on Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 at the theatre.
During his long career, he also appeared in movies and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of the magic minister Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his vet role in the book All-Haired My Friends series based on James Herriot.
The BBC’s popular series was filmed through seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for text messages that incited to suicide
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for text messages and phone calls to incite her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, executes his 15 months sentence in prison and five years under condition.
Carter was sentenced to death in June. Her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
My family is broken,” Conrad’s father said at a Thursday session.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter appealed to the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be heard in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and cream-coloured blouse, heard his judgment's hands crossed with a weeping glance at the ground.
His actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor said to the court.
He decided to improve Conrad’s life.
He has not taken responsibility for the work,” the prosecutor continued.
He hasn’t shown repentance.”
According to Carter’s lawyer, the case was caused by “the shocking circumstances that Carter regrets deeply.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter’s “age or maturity level and not even mental health problems had a significant impact on his act.”
The prosecutor read Conrad’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement in which the mother told him that “it’s not a day that I wouldn’t mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all this, and I try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear.”
Conrad’s sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that he is “will be persecuted” by the idea that he will never see his brother’s wedding or be an aunt for his children.
It’s painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never eases,” Camdyn said.
The case seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car for carbon poisoning dead in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had in his text messages incited his boyfriend to commit suicide.
Hang yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself. I don’t know, there are many ways,” Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks prior to his death. Roy was on holiday with his family at the time.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you are free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published Knox’s statement: “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.”
NATO Secretary General: Internships with Russia the worst the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, comments NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could strive for close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to the persistent instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions would not tighten to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation of the situation and a new cold war.
Prior to Stoltenberg's comments, President Donald Trump stated that the U.S.-Russian relations were even at a dangerous level.
Trump urged to thank the poor inter-state Congress, which last week accepted the new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to a rear-end experience from car manufacturers
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW offered to update the software for more than 350 000 cars.
The BMW Director said that the company believes that “it is more sensible than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities such as the BMW hometown Munich, which is considering restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke about the callback.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of equipment that neutralises emissions increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of cooperating with major car companies and of ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen mistakes. Volkswagen installed in cars spoofing devices that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations. In regular driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but their efforts are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Audi engine development department, who was responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation concerning Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system for its vehicles to circumvent European emission requirements. The accusation was based on a similar study in the United States.
Audi's investigation may significantly impair Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionate.
Violence investigation began with Venezuela’s vote, big demonstrations on the way
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unheard of opinion from a company that has no role in the election result,” said Tibisay Lucenan, Chair of the National Election Committee.
Maduro assures the crisis will end
In Venezuela, on Sunday, a controversial vote was adopted to amend the constitution of the country.
Opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be ongoing at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, the country’s national security forces began to take over the country’s parliament building on Wednesday evening.
The troops are supposed to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region in southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had decreased due to drought and disease-bearing insects, and scientists and farmers are trying feverishly to find a solution to the problem.
Lavender is endangered in the region of Provence because it has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change, and as a result, rainfall in the spring and especially in the autumn have clearly decreased,” says Eric Chaisse, expert at CRIEPPAM, a research institute specialising in agriculture in Provence.
This shortens the life of lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small caskets to the area that spread microbacteria.”
The stakes are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Instead of long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or are missing altogether,” Chaisse says.
In other words, there are fewer essential oil-containing parts.”
The solution is sought by boosting watering, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture, and spraying plants with a protective blend of clay and water, and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
Editor's murder manifests a growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper, which is published once a week, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the magazine deals with the latest cases related to organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
However, today we will discuss security for the sake of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been advised to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which one is safer: leave the children at home or take them with them for delivery, where a grenade strike was made in 2009.
Safety experts have written three words on the chalkboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask suppliers for names for each group, no evidence is needed, observations and knowledge are sufficient.
The names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on the payroll of government or drug cartels are criminals who make Mexico’s chaos a life-threatening news.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto entered office in December 2012. Federal protection has 589 journalists affected by attacks and threats, and this year at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, Riodoce’s founder, journalist and source of inspiration.
The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
He is deeply missed, even though he is everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge image of Valdez, showing the middle finger. The image says: “Justice.” Thirties of journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in t-shirts adorned with the smiling face of Valdez, with glasses and a panama hat as a trademark.
The meeting takes place less than two months after the death of Valdez, with journalists discussing their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office was established specifically for the handling of cases of journalists, but according to the Supplier Protection Committee, only two charges have been raised so far.
The murderers of journalists rarely fall into court, as well as from thousands of murders of drug trafficking and organised crime every year, only a few people end up being dealt with by the court.
Riodoce’s editors intend to continue writing about Sinaloa’s violence, even though they are broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, there is little benefit from a security meeting because killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
This meeting is directly wasted time,” he says.
We can’t trust anyone as long as we don’t know the cause of the event.”
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in the state capital of Culiacan in the morning of 15.5.2017.
He had driven only a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced out of his car and shot twelve shots, presumably related to the magazine's name: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off the Valdez car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left to mourn for the wife and two adult children.
The rumours move fast and float freely in Culiacan.
However, the silence of Valdez's death is still.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and exiled to the United States in January, and competing groups want to fill the void.
On the Sinaloa streets, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has two-storey residential buildings of drug paronics, larger than many homes.
The state on the coast has a “peaceful” when only one cartel dominates ports and drug trafficking routes in the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce’s founder and director, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival group that fights against the sons of Guzman.
The story could anger the boys of Guzman: the customers suspected of becoming a gang bought each issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine arrived at the sales outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdezia was not forced to leave the country after another magazine of the same article was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in journalist violence.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up Riodoce with five colleagues, selling shares of the magazine at that time for $50.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with a drug problem,” Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel its bold and honest stuff, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish high-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the magazine that no one else dared to publish.
After eight years of founding Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for News in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Committee for the Protection of Journalism for its courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade.
He admitted that he was openly afraid.
I want to be able to continue my life,” he said when he received a prize from the Supplier Protection Committee.
Drugstore is a “lifestyle” in Sinaloa,” Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
”The supplier must accept a task that falls on him – or play a fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me where I was when they sown death – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
The staff at Riodoce need Valdezia – a joker who cursed like a port worker, they always miss a friend who always received a hug and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines came to his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how they can do their job best and stay alive.
Criminals don’t like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drugstore runways.
They were excluded,” Bojorquez says.
Even in the best case, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
relying on one’s own instincts.
If you feel that everything isn’t right, you have to stay away.
According to Riodoce’s editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that “the impression can be deceived, and so happened in Javier’s case”.
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, and they also do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce’s safety training was held, and a few days earlier it had become apparent that only the spy programs sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had sought shelter in the shade of the tree from the heat of 40 degrees.
The state government had ordered them to guard the premises of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class district of Culiacan.
Some of the journalists guessed in half of their play whether these two police officers belonged to the 50% that the state governor did not consider reliable.
It had been months since the journalists had visited the mountainous countryside controlled by the drug gangs.
This week’s issue of Riodoce’s delivery was planned by three main stories.
The boxing magnitude of Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The magazine also intended to reveal that the government’s use of money was concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacán, just a block from the prosecutor’s office, was a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official knowledge of who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug vendors and authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered under the name of a prominent political revolutionist (PRI) politician, who has managed Mexico’s policy at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases that have received a lot of publicity.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place, one of them, "El Chapo" Guzman's son, managed to escape and avoid the army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they received reliable information about the Valdez column about the abduction.
In the past, we would have known what had happened,” says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed “El Flaco”, Ohukainen due to his slender body structure.
Now all connections to our data sources are different.”
Valdez’s office has been converted into a warehouse with signs and stickers that are against the persecution of journalists.The magazine’s employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists who drive freedom of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took with her a few signs the next morning before the local prosecutor’s office for a demonstration, which was again caused by the new murder of the journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was found, which, based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest louder throughout the country, with “SOS Press” texts appearing in demonstrations on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the investigation of the case of Valdez.
On the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met Sinaloa's governor and accused authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth.
He has since requested that he be removed from the government articles because he is concerned that he is unable to be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, suppliers are surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the command of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 control group, more than half of the attacks on suppliers last year were caused by the police and authorities.
In Mexico, people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body there was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: “I am here for my writings.”
There was a keyboard and headphones next to his cut-out head.
Some of the newspapers have decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo’s El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message to drug cartels on their front page: “What do you want from us?”
Some of the journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and you must be on guard all the time.
Sometimes, criminals were looking for a journalist in their hands, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra – which once needed to be a poet – admits that writing about drug trafficking is scared.
I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce’s editors sat in front of the delivery at midnight on a sidewalk beer when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed, and their phone suddenly started to color up as a sign of a message.
19 people had died in the beach resort of Mazatlan, shooting between competing gangs and safety forces.
The war accelerated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put the news on Riodoce’s website from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
The homepage had to be renewed the next day.
The sirens howled nearby – another shooting scene.
Bojorquez glanced at the police guarding the delivery:
if they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the magazine's murdered founder under this massive portrait, in which the man shows the middle finger to the whole Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says that I can’t even consider ending the activity. “How can I stop the magazine when our trainee asked to get to the street to do the thing on the same day that Javier was murdered?”
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard place"
Hannu Manninen, who turned 39 in April, was short, as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophicly when Manninen fell ill with a cold.
This started a long period of illness, which lasted almost five weeks.
May practically went completely sick.
First, there was a cold and finally such a pediatric disease as ear infections that I had to eat an antibiotic course.
I was able to do only ten per cent of the planned exercises.
I don’t remember when I’ve been so painful for so long.
It was a hard place when I wasn’t able to take advantage of my training,” says Manninen to Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The World Champion of 2007 was granted a traineeship permit only in the second week of June, which was shown in the roll mat test conducted by the Competition and Excellence Sports Research Centre KIHU on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skies with roller skis on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After each three minute, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the tip of the athlete's finger with a needle.
Last autumn I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I stayed only 28 minutes.
A fire against the wall, Manninen says.
For the better direction
After initial difficulties, Manninen says that he has remained healthy.
I have done a wide range of calm aerobic exercises that I have tried to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now the back is a really good five-week period.
Midsummer was also one and a half weeks of holiday from a flight job.
I also had time with my family to visit the cottage.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen as soon as Manninen became the 18th in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and Team Coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for different rhythms compared to last season.
After the first snow races, Ruka would have a weekend of three world cups.
In December, it would be planned to be part of at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans should still be included in Seefeld.
I hope then the name can be found in the Olympic team’s list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would already be the sixth Winter Olympics for Manninen.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, Nummela underlined in the 2002 gold team competition in Salt Lake City.
Dinosaur protected from enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now the researchers have revealed the first research results of a rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that experts call it Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had remained so well that the researchers could even define that its scales were reddish brown and had had a “problematic past”.
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur and the world’s best of its kind.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the mid-term between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Researchers see this as an amazingly well-preserved fossil as a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the most well-preserved vegetable eater of its kind ever-preserved fossil.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to explore his discovery in more detail.
Fossil found in Kallio was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from a 1 100 kilo boulder.
The results of hard work are now available.
If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping,” says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.
It remains in the history of science as Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Leather studies revealed that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, although it had a armor and resembled a walking armor wagon.
Its red and white armor masks its predators, and was also protected by a darker and lighter colouring that still exists on many animals.
According to experts, it was able to better mix with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old Nodosaur rose to the headlines in May and is now on display at Tyrrell’s Royal Paleontological Museum.
Researchers have named it Borealope after Mark Mitchell, a marmitchell museum technician, and Mitchell was part of a team that took more than 7 000 hours to dig out a dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has remained so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a common coloring, where the body is darker and lighter below.
However, the observation was a surprise, because Borealope has significantly larger than current animals with similar coloring.
From it, it can be concluded that dinosaurs eating meat catch it to the extent that evolution favours survival as a means of hiding instead of fighting.
Among today’s animals, deer, zebras and armadillas have similar colorings, which are significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, which suggests that the nodosaur was also seriously threatened.
The prey of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the chalk season were,” Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scales of the Nodosaur reveals that its leather was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, among other things, to study its intestinal content to find out what it ate with its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river when it died and drifted into the sea where it sank on its back to the seabed.
Alberta was then as warm as in Florida today, and the rivers and seas probably extended far beyond today.
This nodosaurus is really significant because its scales have been preserved and it has also remained threefold in its original form,” Brown says.
That’s why it looks almost the same as in the early chalk season
It doesn’t take much imagination to see it: if you squint a little eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping.”
The period of chalk was the era of teropods, huge two-legged dinosaurs eating meat.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years earlier, Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors have been able to prey on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of Tyrannosaurus rex include, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a monster of about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology and they believe that Borealope was washed into the sea after his death and mummed into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best-preserved armored dinosaur with its skins and armor, from muzzle to hip.
Nodosauruses were on average five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two half-metre spikes rose from their pallets.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the current Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has survived down to the smallest detail in the undersea grave.
Its fossilized remains have remained so well that its leather remains in the pitted plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such a survival is “as rare as a lottery win.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
Its skull armour’s bumpy plates still feature fossil-coated leather.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes upward.
I can also calculate the scales of its sole.”
How did one activist learn to answer the question: to whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked 9.8.2014.
He had arrived to New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his Airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
The police just killed an 18-year-old young person, and his body is still on the street.”
Embarrassedly, he noted that no one else had posted the same information to his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were numerous retweets on his timeline from @TheePharoah.
The name belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, and the White Police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
This is amazing,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone off, and when he returned to Twitter later that evening, it was told that people would gather for Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of police lock-bands and screaming people, as well as Brown's father, who said: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed the real video where the police were standing in front of the protesters with the barking dog.
He also tells that he saw a video in which another policeman hurled his rifle and shouted, “I kill all of you... animals.”
This is not normal,” Ferrell remembers that he said.
It wasn’t the kind of murder we’re already used to and that could be said to be typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I cried.”
He booked a return flight home the next day.
Ferrell went to his six-year-old daughter's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years, the documentary film “Whose Streets?” premiered in cinemas on 11.8.2017.
The film is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the perspective of local people who set out on the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove towards Ferguson in a floral dress and with a matching crown with his dressed daughter, they re-discussed what it would be like to live in black and under what circumstances,” they had talked about it countless times before that morning.
Do you remember when I told you how blacks have had to fight for the things we believe in?” Ferrell remembers that he said to his daughter.
We’re going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it’s not right.”
I couldn’t help but take my daughter with me,” Ferrell said later.
Today’s events are... the culmination of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow into it.
He must be prepared for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black, and he must know what we have to do to free ourselves.
Luckily I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, but she is still similar to other black girls.
I feel that I would harm him if I would protect him from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became an activist camp when they waited for information on the handling of the case and eventually found out that there would be no charge against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to relate to activism in a new way.
My activism changed completely after August 9,” she says. While studying at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of a minority nurse student organization, focusing on food law and health differences in black communities.
I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, assistant director of the documentary at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to tell, what was happening.
He asked, “Do you really want to tell what’s going on, or do you want a story you can use?”
The reason for the suspicion was the countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson didn’t have a common voice,” Folayan recently said in an interview, “we wanted to do things differently.”
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism with the convicted prisoners of death.
During the years following the shooting of Brown, he was accompanied by a crew of six other people.
This is not a document that someone talks to us or speaks for us, but we’re talking,” Davis says.
For me, the most important thing was how local people are shown in the film, because I’m presented in the same way.”
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences because they wanted to show that the people’s movement “is not a charismatic leader but a community,” but Ferrell proved to be the most open.
That’s why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as love and marriage.
”I felt pretty naked,” Ferrell laughs as he told me how it felt to see the film for the first time.
But I understood that this work and the human depiction of blacks require a certain vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell's story is repeated and refocused on the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had fired the black teen boy Trayvon Martin in 2012, two of the three founders of the movement identify with queer identity.
”The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement up,” Ferrell says, “it’s because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.”
Folayan agrees: “The movement is really maintained by black women, among whom there are a lot of queer women.”
However, he emphasizes that Ferrell was not selected in the document ‘intentionally’ because of his queer identity.
He got the energy moving,” says Folayan.
It’s no coincidence, however, that he was on the front line, and black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is transmitted from the screen.”
The filming groups of the news have been leaving Ferguson long ago, but the relations between the community and the police are still tight.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of probation left; he was sentenced to block the motorway in a demonstration.
His description of the social policy atmosphere of his home angles is short and concise: “A mess.”
Still, he still relies on a slogan he learned from the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.”
Appropriate unity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning’s DNA
Fridman Gallery, located in New York, is hung in the middle of the exhibition space – white, black, and brown faces, between which one can see in more detail the unity.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning’s cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth's prison, where he executed his 35-year sentence, and was sentenced for leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg’s A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning, which combines technology, technology and art in its work. Manning is a transient and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama alleviated on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning’s DNA algorithmically and based on her genetic data, created 30 portraits, which are sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, a statement on the adaptability, complexity, and underlying causal relationships and identity of interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly identified herself with women since puberty and was found guilty of 20 crimes, including the violation of the Spy Act, computer fraud, and theft in 2013.
There was only one picture of Manning, who was convicted of prison: a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits in the driver’s seat in the car, wearing a platinum-light wig, which became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a popular Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
He created portraits on the basis of criminal data, such as DNA data on cigarette butts and chewing gums, and created images of how the people in question could have looked.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed an image for their story,” Dewey-Hagborg explained at the new exhibition briefing.
Manning was unable to visit and could not be photographed in prison, so the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisonment unexpectedly became correspondent, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-authored the Suppressed Images comic book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted the future in which the President would have alleviated Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence only a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven years in a military prison in the nation.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now, as Donald Trump is running his own war against leaks of information and transgender soldiers and is inventing new ways on Twitter to strengthen the strong divides he actually had to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has its purpose”.
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist’s statement and underneath it is Manning’s great signature, where the last name is i’s heart.In his statement, the artist requires an end to the “automatic breakdown on which sex, race, sexuality and culture have been based”.
On the opposite wall is Manning’s DNA sequence: a long line of letters C, G and A written with a pencil.
With this 200 letter or nucleotid, such as the scientific definition used by the artist, Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are, at least in our biology.
I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in gene genome and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretations,” Dewey-Hagborg says.
DNA tells countless stories, and 30 of them are featured here.”
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from the comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone in his hand.
If they can silence you, they have won,” says the picture.
Never be silent.”
The text is from a letter I received from Manning,” says an artist from Philadelphia.
It’s so impressive that I still get cold colors.”
As described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen an exhibition, and when Manning arrives, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic data as a group of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning’s DNA sequence is written with a pencil on a height that is the same as his length (157.5 cm).
”The face was on the wall before, but I wanted to bring in the feeling of a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg says.
I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release.”
Northwestern University Professor and University of Oxford employee are sought for murder as suspects
The police report that they have launched national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford who are suspected of killing a man in a luxury Chicago apartment.
The Cook County Court documents state that on Monday, arrest orders were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, were issued for the first degree of murder without the possibility of being released from guarantees.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local release published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27.7.2017.
In the Grand Plaza apartment building, alerted police officers found a victim with several cuts in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the event and stabbing is investigated as murder.
Lathem has worked as Assistant Professor in Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice Rector for Social Relations at the University, said in a statement sent by email that Lathem is now on administrative leave and is prohibited from entering the campuses of Northwestern University.
This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University helps with the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
A statement sent by the university and Somerville College spokesperson states that “we have contacted the police in the UK and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in all possible ways.”
In addition, the statement stated that Warren’s colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Information Officer at the Chicago Police Department, said that he urges the suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly refining our searches,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities help in the search of suspects.
He told the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had received a vague hint that 1008 had happened in the apartment.
The police described the scene as terrifying.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim had been murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told the security cameras that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team published the following information to the residents: “The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.”
Man threatened to blow Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
I am not an anti-Muslim, I am Catholic," the convicted said to the police.
Moffatti must provide a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
The 39-year-old man was sentenced for his threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to Independent magazine David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, gross harassment.
According to the police, the staff of the bookstore alerted them on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims".
The suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about the threat.
Threats were not related to bookstore events.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as the suspect of bookstore events, the police spokesman said.
I am not an anti-Muslim, I am Catholic, Moffatt said to the police in interrogation.
As a punishment, a man must perform an unpaid social service for a hundred hours and pay legal expenses of approximately £620, i.e. £690, and £85, i.e. compensation for victims.
According to the Scotland Yard spokesman, several hate crimes are not reported.
We will complete the actions in line with the WADA roadmap in the near future” – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete its actions in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s WADA roadmap to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Committee’s RUSADA.
Some of the measures in line with the roadmap have already been implemented, and RUSADA was granted the right to design and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the UK’s Anti-Doping Committee.
The road map of WADA has been updated in these respects,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister comments on the second part of the WADA roadmap, which defines the conditions for restoring the powers of the RUSADA, and the second part of the roadmap was recently published on the organisation’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything worrying from Russia’s point of view.
Everything has been announced, and everything is done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future,” Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly approve the results of a study by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which examines the alleged share of the state in Russian sports doping.
Mutko said: “The study is underway because our anti-doping system has granted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programs, and we cannot admit anything that didn’t exist.”
The words of Mutko echoed the opinion of Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Committee.
Previously speaking to the Russian RSport sports media on the same day, Smirnov admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping games, “We have said several times that there are controversial statements and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally,” he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to cease doping control in Russia in November 2015, after the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
Last June, however, it received permission to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD.
Olivier Niggli, WADA’s director, visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July, after which he stated that the organization was “on the right path” towards the restoration of powers.
The British organisation as skeptical of Finnish love for innovation: the health benefits of maternity packaging "no evidence"
The British organisation suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packaging.
The BBC and Guardian, among other things, say that Lullaby Trust, which fights cot death, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in the UK.
Distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women begins this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some regions.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package would reduce the risk of cot death.
Cot death means the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust acts as an expert of the UK health authorities in the area of a child's safe sleep.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packed with them, as it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization announced.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two dead per thousand born.
According to Lullaby Trust, good reading in Finland is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that there is given each family a box may be one factor.
But it can’t be said for sure,” said Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is marketed as products that reduce child mortality and cot death.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland free of charge for 80 years.
The package includes a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year, the package contains 53 products.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it divides meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best option for sleeping if there is no cradle or cot available.
The organisation recommends using the packaging only for naps and to stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the package and making sure that it does not get wet or dirty.
Vikkelä villain escaped from the Japanese zoo for a second time
The staff of the Japanese zoo are looking for a fugitive turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and has already escaped for a second time within two weeks.
The turtle ran away from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, Western Japan on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villa was leaving the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very worried, Yoshimi Yamane who works in the zoo told us.
The runaway 35-year-old villain is female, 55-pound and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villa can move freely around the area of the shelter.
The zoo has not received eyewitness observations of the turtle.
The previous run of the villain happened in the second week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your business avoid Uber errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her online store startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
”Queries were simply neither consistent nor objective,” Errett says. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on the online store, with 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to external assistance.
More and more new HR startups have entered the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement, and companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous whistleblowing services to their employees, and in some cases, directly past the top management board.
My health can be monitored with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the time for companies’ Fitbit?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint startup in Redwood City, who offers companies analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years, and he says that he has gained an even deeper insight into his employees’ thoughts and knowledge.
The program can be used to make quick queries and polls for specific teams, as well as to create a map where you can see at a glance which departments are the most dissatisfied and which of the leaders have received the weakest assessments, which has allowed Errett to drill down to the core of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to monitor their workplace culture so that they don’t become the next Uber, and since a former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where employees are being harassed and those who speak problems are being punished.
For startups like Glint, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation, and compliance are a global industry that, according to the Let’s Talk Payments website, can reach more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Located in Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior, and interest in the company increased earlier this year when Uber’s reputation experienced a crash.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
It recently made a deal with Uber as well.
Like Glint, Convercent allows businesses to conduct customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously via text.
And if there is reason to suspect misconduct, complaints will go directly to the company’s board of directors.
The public opinion has been overthrown by the authorities,” says Patrick Quinlan, Convercent’s founder and CEO.
He points out that if a company treats its employees poorly or unethically, the consequences may be costly even if the authorities do not intervene, consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and become challenged to justice.
Ruby Tuesday has more than 25 000 employees at 500 locations, and has been using Convertia for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and are easily contacted by the head office.
In the past, it was practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, they first had to find out the phone number or e-mail address that could be used to file a report at the head office, then they had to file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” says James Vitrano, General Counsel of Ruby Tuesday, who found it difficult to follow the complaints made by the employees.
Previously, problems remained hidden from managers working in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can now be detected and dealt with faster.
I get a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the employee’s reality,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation.”
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activity in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public settlement of their dirty laundry.
Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the supervision of ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, the use of which is charged on a regular basis.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by private equity investors, and both Glint and Convercent are supported by private equity investors.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
Good salaries in competitive markets like Silicon Valley, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly beneficial company.
Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they feel comfortable in the company and feel that they are listened to and their work is rewarding,” says Nina McQueen, Executive Vice President, LinkedIn, who is responsible for employee remuneration and well-being.
Investors gain revenue when companies succeed, and companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder that they are of interest to investors.
According to workplace culture experts, information on employee engagement is important,
but it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be ready to have four thousand discussions,” says Russell Raath, Director General of the management consultancy Kotter International, who has seen companies trust too much to gather only information.
If the company does not take any action, employees will start to wonder if they were heard
and whether their opinions matter at all.
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting employee surveys on a monthly basis and is able to tackle the problem on the same day it is reported on Glint.
After collecting feedback from employees frustrated with the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees even better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the long-term resilience of its staff in a sector known for its high turnover.
If the company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,” Vitrano says.
If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies.”
In Sweden, 20-year-old men are suspected of eavesdropping their naked neighbours, says news agency TT.
The woman in Gothenburg had come out of the shower when she noticed a mobile phone hanging at the end of a string outside her window.
According to the woman, the camera on the mobile phone was photographed in the apartment.
The woman, frightened by the case, had run into another room to dress.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but then re-calculated to the window shortly after.
A suspect of ciphering, a 20-year-old man has admitted that he has photographed a woman.
He claimed, however, that he had only depicted a woman’s face.
The video depicted on the mobile phone had been removed, and the police had failed to return it as proof.
In interrogations, the man has granted a deed, but he has denied that he has committed a crime.
The man had justified his depiction by saying that he loves his neighbor "insane".
According to the news agency TT, a charge against a man is brought against the case.
Teachers demand more extra in autumn negotiations
Salary development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed,” said OAJ’s Chairman Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut of public sector holiday money emphasizes the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements where the review would not have included holiday money cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts are concluded only after private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luke predicts that, for example, OAJ’s terms of employment have been agreed on in January.
Luke did not reveal the percentage targets yet.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of the public sector-trained negotiation organisation Juko.
Luukkainen: Holiday pay cut increases the differences in earnings development
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees will decrease, while the purchasing power of the private sector will increase.
According to Luukkainen, fixed-term holiday money cuts will further steep the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, the number of students per teacher must be determined
In addition, OAJ points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between those who cope best and the weakest increase all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and the differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins players' day lengthened as NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It’s time for eleven o’clock in the evening, and a group of UCLA football players have been able to talk to the other side of the new training fields on the campus.
Some have stripped their shirts, their backs are shiny with sweat after the first day of the training camp.
Time for many of them to have a few minutes of chatting is the noon break.
After three hours of rehearsals, students of the university will return to the dormitory to read the final exams, and the next morning they will meet at the seven Wasserman Football Center.
The next three days will be tough for these guys,” says Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday changes to Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation for university sports reduced the number of daily training sessions to two; the aim of the change was to reduce the number of players’ workload, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the last final tests are held.
That’s why the first three UCLA sessions started over 15 minutes in the evening, and it was difficult for players to find space on the full schedule.
Limiting training sessions to one day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time Mora’s six seasons during the Westwood coach season, when the training sessions are held at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparation for the opening game of the season begins: UCLA meets Texas A&M in September.
Mora says she has supported NCAA’s rule change, even though it made players’ schedules even tighter.
We put a lot of strain on them for three or four days, and that’s very challenging,” says Mora.
But players are ready to work, they are great friends.
I believe that the situation will become easier when we get to Saturday, then we will have more time.
UCLA closes workouts from outside the camp, which is not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombarded with football flying over the protective net behind the goal post.
Bruins players are supposed to move to the hotel in the coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
We have security arrangements,” Mora says.
The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises for the video from there, which is not an exaggerated concern.
A video of the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and the parking lot.
We do our best.
I’m not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan.”
Freedom to Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in central African Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially aiming for his third season, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
Then the Rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been reviewed, among other things, for opposition crushing and limiting freedom of speech ­.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics, for example.
For the third season, Kagame is able to strive because the constitution that delimited the presidency to two seasons changed.
However, in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have been made and international investments have flown into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in merging the land shared by genocide.
Rwanda’s success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagamek has promised more freedom to his people since the country has lifted its feet.
Now it could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact checking
Facebook intends to send possible fake news to more and more independent fact-checkers and present the results below the original article, the world’s largest social network announced this on Thursday.
On its website, the company published an opinion that it will start using the updated machine learning to identify fake news, which may be sent to fact-checkers and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest fake news distributors, and many believe that fake news had an impact on the result of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has risen to a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news before the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September election, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that fact-checking is tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
People want to see which stories do not pass the screen of independent auditors, and they want more background information to decide more enlightenedly what they read and share,” Sara Su, Product Manager at Facebook News Feed, wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing related articles and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small castle of Scotney in Kent County is now known for Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it, and now, in a charming location in the Bewl River Valley, this castle is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer who prefers old documents.
I love to study the text written by a person who died over 300 years ago,” Rhodes says with a longing.
I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand.”
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families who lived in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era, each illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book in Rhodes based on archives. In 2014, he appeared in Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspirations were documents from the British National Library.
I moved to tears when I noticed a thumb print in the letter, written by a dual agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 1700s,” says Rhodes.
It was his fingerprint!
And letters smell like smoke, because then fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel like he is on the spot himself.
I love archives!”
The author who was interested in old documents lived in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the National Art Council of England, which seemed too good to be true, he admits that he could not have been in the castle without delay for a little longer than it would have been wanted.
He spent days exploring the Victorian “new” castle, archives, treasures and rarities, including hyena heads hanging on walls and bottles in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with the forest guards, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists illustrating the book.
In the evenings he “taken a whiskey and started writing.”
Scotney's closer history is quite unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff was just about to start reviewing the archive, describing that the archives had been held for hundreds of years in the same method: taking everything extra to the attic.
There were diaries, letters from the times of the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. “You could imagine that land disputes are boring,” Rhodes says.
It came to mind that it would already be.”
Some of the stories of the book proceed from the castle to the history of England, as The Labourer tells about a man who soon after the castle was completed, joins the peasant rebellion in England in 1381.
The book Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380,” says Rhodes.
The peasant rebellion in England started in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could start with riot.
Perhaps these events are interconnected?”
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, a story of a priest that Darrell’s family hidden seven years during the Reformation of England.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 1700s, who said he had staged his own funerals by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his graves were opened).
Darrells are Rhodes’ favourite family in Scotney. “The men of the family seem to have been quite a fellow; they were constantly in debt and bought things they could not afford.
The men of Darrell’s family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who could swarm the heiress.”
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life Hill, a sanatorium in the early 1900s, left only a eutrophic plot.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
It was sad to leave there,” he says.
”I didn’t want to go back to this bad everyday life yet.”
Distances to Russia worst then cold war
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, comments NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could strive for close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to the persistent instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions would not tighten to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation of the situation and a new cold war.
Prior to Stoltenberg's comments, President Donald Trump stated that the U.S.-Russian relations were even at a dangerous level.
Trump urged to thank the poor inter-state Congress, which last week accepted the new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshko ends - rematch against Anthony Joshua does not come true
Professional boxing for a long time with a heavyweight world champion Vladimir Klitshko will end his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
Klitsko, who hit the gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, competed as a professional 69 times, winning 64.
He held various World Championship titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his last two matches in his career.
Tyson Fury beat him with points in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost in a knockout of 11th.
Joshua and Klitshkon were expected to face in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitshko said in his announcement.
I achieved everything I dreamed of as an amateur and professional boxer, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for it.
See Klitshko’s reasons for the decision on the video.
Klitshko’s manager Bernd Bönte said in a press release that the closure decision was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always emphasized that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That’s why this is definitely the right decision,” said Bönte.
Klitshko has been dating American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, the daughter of Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko’s big brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Cup titles of the various federations at the same time.
The weather striker in Finland witches the circumstances: "Take up the feeling"
Spine jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the outer iron age of the summer.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the conditions.
The wind and the cold have led to a woman’s feeling.
The London World Cup also has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The conditions have been against the pole jumper Minna Nikka this summer.
I didn’t want to blame the track, but it was unthinkable that I didn’t even make small sticks move properly,” Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I’ve been racing and practicing here, I know how many times and I’ve never experienced one of the different winds in this place, says Nikkanen at Paavo Nurmi’s Games.
During this season, it has been really difficult to standardise the jump, as there have been such unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen stated in the Kaleva competitions.
The weather spoke on Thursday in London, too.
It has been quite challenging to get the technology together - whether it is a cold freeze or what.
It has been cold and windy, and it has led to a feeling.
It makes no sense to consume energy in bad conditions.
He reached the 455 World Championships thanks to his hall jump.
Outdoors has gone to 445.
The condition is not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be temperate and expect better winds.
The goal is to exceed Friday qualification 460.
Why not train abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got to jump together and the technology to standardize.
I should have done the same.
Normally the hall has been rehearsed, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal weather to compete with?
25 degrees warm.
Even a small wind will run as long as it is standard.
An experienced ex-officer upset politicians at Yle: "We have no allocations now and for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä’s Board of Directors must keep the ice in the hat and warn of the increase in the state budget with debt money, says Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared budgets for decades in the Ministry of Finance.
According to him, there is no allocation.
Yle interviewed Virta, who had retired in 2015, in Wednesday’s No. 1 Morning.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just starting.
Recently, propositions by politicians to increase the guarantee pension, calculate car tax and support e-bikes, among other things, are seen as electoral speeches.
They mainly indicate that the elections are starting to be close because when ten percent of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no allocations now and for many years.
I even have a deception to talk about the allocation amount when the debt is taken,” Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt is debt to children.
Virtanen has extensive experience in preparing state budgets: he started as a budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance in 1978 and then worked as assistant manager and budget manager for the budget department.
He was the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
Virtanen pointed out in an interview with Yle that the forecasted growth of three per cent is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a spike, from which we will start to go downhill next year, and Finland is expected to grow by one per cent for decades.
Washington changes the rules for a permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of a permanent residence permit, i.e. Green Card, would be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
New rules have been proposed by Republicans and are supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of the Congress.
This Act reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy,” Trump stated, according to the media.
Danish Queen's spouse does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margaret photographed in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her spouse Prince Henrik, 83, will not be buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the couples of rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King’s Room has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court states in its press release on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, this is due to the prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, says Lene Belleby, Head of Communications at the court.
For the Prince, the decision that he is not buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated equally with his spouse.
According to Hovi, the queen has long been aware of her husband’s wish for a burial place and understands the decision.
Horror on the road: The car was coming on the highway
Tommi had a common-law husband and two small children on board.
They were not injured in an accident, but do not receive any money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
Turma happened at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Stock Photo of Ring Road III's construction site.
Vantaa-based Tommi says that his family survived on Tuesday a miracle in a car accident.
Tommi, his common-law spouse Riina and the couple’s two small children drove on the highway at Keimolaport in Vantaa, in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
The Ring III junction to Hämeenlinnanväylä was driven by a white car that was driving to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without the evasion movement, the car would have been turned on according to Tommi.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it left, Tommi says.
The family car crashed into the railing at a rapid pace.
Parents and two young children in the back seat were not injured.
One child is slightly under 3 years old, the other child is under one year old.
It was obviously pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one who passed by drove us even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident occurred at about 17.20.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency centre.
They got out of the car on their own.
The staff of the ambulance and the rescue department arrived, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went into redemption condition.
Tommi says that he and his cohabiting partner have a small income, and they received assistance from the family for buying a car a couple of years ago.
According to Tommi, without the other car’s information, the family does not receive any money from the insurance.
Therefore, the family wishes eyewitnesses to observe the car, which is why the family drove into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It’s difficult to take children to a shelter and work without it,” Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was likely from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
In his opinion, the beginning of the car registration number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don’t know how we manage financially, we still have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that he has seen something or knows about it will be in contact with the police.
The East Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had an accident site on Tuesday evening.
Corrected at 21.15: In contrast to what was originally told in the story, another car did not come to meet up lanes according to Tommi, but it was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jäppinen’s performance deals with relationships by means of humor - The self-discloser will be seen at What? on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, who comes from Kouvola, brings her first guidance to What? theatre.
The self-discloser is a musical theatre performance about unfortunate relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good impression.
The subject is treated by means of humor.
We don’t have to be overwhelmed by unpleasant feelings,” he says.
According to Jäppinen, the orbiting summer theatre performance has been carried out on a pesky budget and with a big, young heart.
The name of the performance challenges people to think about what they reveal about themselves when getting to know a new person.
Maybe he pulls out some role or does he approach another jacket open?
Plotless performance mixes fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the group and does not have a plot.
The director believes that even though the performance draws on young people’s thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the Exhibitionist does not directly tell about his own or the working group’s relationships.
The fact and fiction are mixed.
My values are certainly conveyed by the proposal.
I don’t think that relationships are bad, but also that a relationship, especially a relationship, would be a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Exhibitionist draws an up-to-date picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least, you have to listen to yourself.
There is no need to stay in a bad relationship.
Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka will play in the performance.
The working group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music arrangement is by Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love for theatre was born in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, studies theatre as a director at Turku University of Applied Sciences.
The back is two years and the front is the second mokoma.
Jäppinen’s enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the years in Kouvola.
The music classes have been raised as an assistant in Kouvola Theatre, and they have performed at the Student Theatre in Helsinki, and most recently at the Linnateatteri in Turku.
Steering has become more and more interesting.
The self-discloser premiered last week in Helsinki on the Narri stage.
A 45-minute performance has also been seen in the future at least in the study town of Jäppinen in Turku.
Self-discloser at Kouvolan What? Theatre on 4.8. at 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
Finnish Olympic Champion recovered for a year from a terrible motocross accident - the cervical spine broke
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural power as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of the hilly descent toured the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela’s business continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also a pilot of new sports.
There are not many forms of exercise on earth that a Kemijärvier would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired you to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
Eventually, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela faced a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I was not working in any way.
I licked wounds at my home for a year, Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age could be a part of the mistake.
Driving on a bike can sound wild.
But I didn’t apply for limits with it.
It’s just so hard as a sport that you shouldn’t overdo this forties!
After the accident, Lahtela was faced with a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long career behind as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle national team.
Lahtela started in the estate immediately after his career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn’t really do much,” Lahtela says.
During his training, Lahtela often challenged his protective equipment on the slopes and in physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that even my own thoughts didn’t feel sensible.
Not even with the sport.
Did good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I really just got to be.
A compulsory break inspired Lahtila to become the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he is afraid that he would have finished.
It is easier to find places in the body that have gone away than intact!
Without an accident, I would not have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a freestyle national team coach about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a certain hobby to replace speed sports.
I changed my motocross to frisbee golf!
It left the mitten right away.
At worst, I was seven hours a day tossing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer herself, she does not require her trainees to be similar to her.
I don’t force everyone into the same mold.
There is room in our species culture to be unique and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots come and we should be worried
It’s here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry – just as it had started to feel like 2017 can’t get any more weird.
Yes, only.
Sex robots are now a big deal.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5–10 years.
We must start to take the generalization of sex robots seriously,” says Noel Sharkey, the founder of the foundation and the emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernail.
”The sex robots are hit, but they are already being sold quite a lot, and we will see them even more,” said Sharkey at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and AI-generated features that resemble human use.
The user can also customize the robot to their own preferences, from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernail.
Even more worrying is that robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford’s women look like advanced freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character traits of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, for example, shy.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
Roxxxy Gold’s personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user’s personality,” the company’s website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
it can be tired, with a chat mood or in a “that mood”.
There are many concerns about the generalization of sex robots, which replace genuine relationships, but there are even more dangerous women’s realisation and direct rape fantasies when a user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and objectionable.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to the vibrator on its website:
Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn’t men have a sex robot?”
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalization and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: the recession from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where we are one of the alternatives among others.
Of course, most men don’t get a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many will start to behave strangely or offensively only when the market gives its permission.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more common at the same time as women’s rights are threatened around the world and in the White House sits a president who has boasted that he has harassed women.
In the television series The Handmaid’s Tale (Your Slave Woman) is not the most worrying of its powerful imagery, for example, images of hanging bodies and out-excavated eyes.The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are attempted to do as much with the proportions of real women (porn stars) as is technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel authentic and movements to mimic human movements as well as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
The robot is unable to leave the relationship or situation.
They have neither their own will nor history—nothing referring to independence or violating the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
The police suspects: two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, the group was led by ISIS Manager
The leader of the ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb to an airline called Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a member of the ISIS leaders had also sent to Sydney bomb builds.
Suspects suggest that the bomb was supposed to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police will not tell you more about why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device that emits toxic colorless gas and to take the device to a crowded public place, for example in a public transport system.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One man has been released, but his interrogations are also continued.
The good sides of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a story of a healthy sense
During the Trump season, it has already been repeated to bore boredom that the strong division of voters in two has also broken down families at the daily level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory boards of American newspapers were used to guide how to get along with relatives who have voted for Trump.
We all want to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to connect families.
I will tell you about this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long been the buttons against the Republicans of our family.
He reminded that a common enemy can have a powerful connecting effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins all acquaint themselves – also the sibling who has been trying to argue with Republicans for decades – are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but in a broader sense, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new stream, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization”, we talk about the scary possibility that one day we will no longer be able to be terrified by his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying chance that Trump normalizes the Republicans of the right extreme, which, in comparison to Trump, suddenly seem quite sensible.
I reminisce about Mitt Romney’s understated version of madness: the dog on the car roof, the income tax of 14% (and his tax return, at least, we’ve seen), and compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild violations.
After Trump’s term is over, the next presidential candidate in Republicans only needs to be clear-witted, and it immediately feels a noticeable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to the central park carousel, the biggest carousel in the park department of New York and the best that New York gets for three dollars without caffeine.
Carousel horses are huge, the characters in the middle – grotesque clowns and animals who look back in horror – are ominous, and the squealing music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York City’s hallmarks become disappointment over time: the views from tall buildings start to saturate, the skyline becomes too familiar and the city’s reality does not correspond to dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I’ve been over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a big roundabout in North London, although Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-style pub, but it’s not counted.
The central park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience – even to the extent that two women aged twelve, one eleven-year-old and two forties enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my review, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week in the department store to evaluate my “payment experience” on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the reader.
The same thing in the cafe at my home corner, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine the estimate with a 15% service money when I personally pick up the coffee from the counter.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the businessman to put his persona in a game where it is not needed.
The department store saleswoman smiled regretfully when I gave my credit card a five star experience.
Shefki Kuqi got fired from the Internet - "There was no management trust"
FC Inter has today liberated Shefki Kuq from the role of representative team coach.
Fabrizio Piccare has previously worked as an assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching group will continue in its current tasks.
Italian Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach in English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter coaching group, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of FC Inter’s Board of Directors, is sorry to have taken place.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club management, so there was no other option now, Håkans comments in the club’s press release.
The Piccareta agreement is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is responsible already in the morning at home against HIFK.
According to Ilta-Sanomat's data, the team has been bubbly throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the club’s assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta teamed up heavily in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth portrait of the 80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
On Instagram, violinist Linda Lampenius published a youth image.
Several Hästagis have been added to the picture, which can be used to determine that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself marvels at the young woman who looks at the camera.
Long ago, serious, she communicates.
If the picture does not appear, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about sore topics.
Just over a year ago, he published a picture pair on Instagram of himself.
In the second picture he is seen 20 years ago, in the second he is posing now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered at a younger age.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text she had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, uncertain, self-esteem, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
He was already at the age of 14 at the hospital due to anorexia and orthopedics.
Slightly later, he also fell ill with bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
Healing started slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius delivered from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year he received hospital treatment for cut-outs on his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he fell in the cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder by the prosecutors of the chosen original sentence of killing.
He killed Steenkamp's Valentine's Day in early hours in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he had thought his girlfriend was an intruder at night who was hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they are going to complain again because they consider the six-year sentence of Pistory too mild.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be processed already this year.
If the complaint is accepted, the judgment of Pistory may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported by the country's Foreign Ministry, according to the bTV channel.
The police arrested an unauthorized number of camped people in Sithonia on the 1st of August, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to bTV, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs announced later that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free campsites and are already imposing fines on anyone who is camping in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
Inspections will continue until the end of the season.
The Ministry announced that the right to impose a fine.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritated bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People suffering from irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid in protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, director of the study, the immune cells guard the intestines and ensure that the hideous harmful microbes in the food do not enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen resilience and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The experiments found that immune cells that strengthen immunity are found in mice with a specific bacteria in their intestines.
This bacteria needs tryptophan for immune cells to begin to appear, and tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
We found a connection between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote resilience, and Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbiome of the gut,” says Professor Colonna.
The more tryptophan there was in the diet of mice, the more they had such immune cells.”
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
When studying immune cells that strengthen immunity, Postdoctoral Researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that while one group of mice had such cells, they were not found in mice of the same type that were considered separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiome of mice, i.e. the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When examining the intestinal DNA of mice, six bacterial species were detected, which were found in mice that had immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were given to mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have an intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, increasing Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferring small amounts of liquids – without bacteria – from mice to isolated immature immune cells.
Immune cells developed into cells that strengthen resilience.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthen tolerance increased by about 50 per cent, while the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell to half earlier.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-boosting cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria cause the cells to develop in humans in the same way as with mice.
We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines,” says Cervantes-Barragan.
A high tryptophan level combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their proliferation.”
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United was ‘nero’ after making a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United was matched with Nemanja Matic after making a ‘neron’ deal, and the midfielder debuted in Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, won 2–1 in Dublin, the United Kingdom’s last pre- UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressed defending midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic wasn’t in the best condition yet, as he wasn’t involved in the Asia-Pacific tour before the start of the season, and he only managed to do the field for 45 minutes – according to Mourinho, it must change before the start of the Premier League season.
He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mindset make him a genius – he has a natural mindset for football,” Mourinho says.
We help him to be ready sooner than later.”
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were about to start the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file their start-up assembly for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants three new players, although the club has already done a ‘great job’ by getting three of his four priorities.
Three out of four – you have to thank the club,” he added.
I’m happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job.”
Volleyball women bullied Germany for two lots
The Finnish women’s national volleyball team lost their fourth match in the World Cup to Germany directly 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany’s routine level in gaming is high.
Even their game was in every sector, Tapio Kangasniemi, head coach of Finland, said in a press release.
In the first two instalments, Finland kept its opponents narrow, but in the third instalment, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we were playing patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to sway along, Kangasniemi said.
The most powerful in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.
On Sunday, Slovenia still encounters Finland losing three games.
Reuters: A large jury already posed challenges to Trump Jr's meeting in Russia
In the United States, a large jury has challenged the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veslinitskaya.
A large jury invited by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already challenged the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for Kremlin connections.
Reuters, a news agency, confirms that Wall Street Journal has previously revealed information about the convening of a large jury.
According to Reuters, a large jury has challenged the meeting of Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for Kremlin connections, which took place in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr’s campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, the current advisor of the White House, were also present.
According to the sources of Reuters, the fact that Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington means that the pace of the Russian investigation is condensed.
Sources add that Mueller wanted to assist a large jury in investigating Russia’s interference with the US presidential elections and whether Trump’s campaign or his immediate circle was collaborating with Russia.
The great jury expands Mueller’s rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to prove on oath.
A large juror is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The large jury weighs the evidence determined by the prosecutor in the investigation and decides whether the matter should raise the charges.
British inventor microchipped himself to get home and his car with a hand swing
The British inventor is the first in the whole country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, enter his office and start his car with a hand swing.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of the 33-year-old Steven Northam, now offering service to companies and individuals who want to make life easier with the technology of the Northam BioTeq company.
Northam works with Geoff Watson, a consulting doctor at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester to ensure that the installation of a microchip meets the medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchips for cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds to install.
The Northam company also converts house and car locks into compatible with a microchip, with one lock handling costing £300.
He is married and has one child and has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when he lowers his hands on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The final decision of the White House to fly the naval helicopter to the southern grassland of the White House for an event presenting American production came to the taxpayers for $24,000, which is reflected in the military documents received by the TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the president is on board it, as an attraction at an event held in the White House on 17 July 2017 where American construction programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials got to know the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter made in Connecticut, the exhibits included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to be placed on a mission-specific order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an ‘extraordinary’ event, which is reflected in the documentation of the naval HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of the issue because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility,” the HMX-1 unit manager wrote in an email the day before the event to his supervisor, the Deputy Commander of the Navy Air Command.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field on 17.7. at seven in the morning and the event would begin in three afternoons.The helicopter would not leave the place until the grass field was emptied between six and nine in the evening.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter’s departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed due to service hours restrictions.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the security personnel of the unit were at the helicopter while it was in the country.
The documents received by the TIME magazine are not clear whether another crew was eventually needed.
The US Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired whether the event violated the law.
One of our questions was whether this violated the Hatch Act, we were told not to be violated,” the commander wrote.
It sounds like you can participate,” the assistant commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the President spoke in favour of the health care reform at the time that was being discussed by the Senate and the looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them on their travels,
But their use only for photos is unusual.
Trump’s actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One ran the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and Trump has criticized the use of his predecessor’s presidential aircraft on Twitter.
The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented American workers’ American-made products from all 50 states,” said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Secretary.
The crews of the HMX-1 unit regularly make training flights in the Washington area and practice bringing the president to the White House with precision on the southern lawn.
With the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, flights to Made in America were part of the crew’s educational quota.
On that day, the unit’s helicopters also operated for 11 hours in non-presidential support tasks.
According to the White House, the event did not entail any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky’s spokesman told us that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter presentation on the southern grassland of the White House.
HMX-1 has no accounting for flights related to presidential duties, and it is difficult to estimate the exact cost of an event.
According to the hourly compensations of the Ministry of Defence in 2017, the VH-3D helicopter’s compensation level is $24 380 per flight hour.
According to the documents of the HMX-1 unit, flights from Quantico base in the State of Virginia to the White House and back lasted a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
According to the compensation level, the calculation of the costs to taxpayers is misleading,” Walters says.
The estimated compensation level includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in annual appropriations.”
According to a study conducted by RAND in 2015, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, Sean Spicer, the former press secretary of the White House, defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
The idea is to introduce American production,” said Spicer.
I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national safety and will probably employ hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopters and other defensive items that many Americans have worked hard on.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring it out.”
It is not certain whether Trump visited the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down on the driver's seat of the fire truck.
In the white house, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
I know Sikorsky very well,” the President said. “I have three of them.”

Prosecutor General of Venezuela claims the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative in the country
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor-General has applied for a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new representative in the country.
President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela has announced that the Representative Council elected in the last Sunday’s vote is to be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, a representative council was elected for the country, which may, among other things, change the constitution of the country.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the decision to prevent elections has been requested due to suspicions of election misconduct.
Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation on the vote.
He appointed two judges after the UK polling agency announced that the results have been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro’s allies were nominated for the Representative Council, and the 545-member council consists of, among other things, Maduro’s son and wife.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the Representative Council may break down the opposition-led Congress and amend the laws.
Maduroa described as a dictator
Maduro's actions are widely condemned.
Opposition considers the modification of the Constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, on the other hand, have announced that they do not recognise the new Council of Representatives.
Maduro claims that the new Representative Council is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, unrest has continued for months.
Many people have been wounded in them and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after the price of oil dropped.
Now, not many people can afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to show the opinion on Friday, when the new Representative Council is scheduled to start.
Finland’s handover of the Russians was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
The Minneapolis Court in the United States condemned the 41-year-old Maxim Senah for nearly four years of imprisonment for participation in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a US demand.
According to the Russian magazine Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he had returned home.
Finland handed down Senah to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian objections, says the news agency AFP.
He was found guilty of computer fraud in March this year, which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after the execution of the prison sentence.
After the arrest, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticised Finland hardly and said that a man should not be handed over to the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were criticised for the fact that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing the matter in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which seized tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further steer the internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Acting Director of the Criminal Division of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also able to chase cybercriminals that operate in other countries.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a press release.
Modified at 20.58: Fixed the transcription of the name of the convicted person.

Kari Kola implements an exceptional light art piece in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (in the picture) will carry out an exceptional light art work in honor of the first day of Light in Paris next year on 16 May.
Kola creates a light art piece called Day and Night in Paris.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The Unesco Headquarters Fontenoy Building and the Globe Monument in front of it are illuminated.
With my work, I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a significant problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make things that I feel important concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am well invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was at the opening of the Light theme year in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO headquarters to celebrate the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-establish my art at the UNESCO headquarters,” Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand significantly.
We will inform about this later in the coming autumn, Kola continues.

The driver who drove in the forbidden direction of driving would sway the driver of the other car, as a result of which the car started crashing the batter into the car.
After that, he hit the bonnet of the car.
In the preliminary talk, the man has admitted that he has caused damage and that he has done wrong.
Writing headed from Timo Soini with the question mark: "After that came the flood"
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (UV) published a blog post on Thursday, headed with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the Flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soini’s text contains references to the French of the 1700s.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the parable of a flood.
Depending on the interpretation, there have been a utterance in the books of history "after us a flood" or "after me a flood".
According to the UN, Afghanistan’s democracy depends on the political role of women
Elections are representative only if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, said the head of the UN delegation to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Director of the Permanent Mission to the United Nations, said that hundreds of women are nominated for the Council elections, three women seek to become vice presidents, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
The role of women cannot be overemphasized,” Haysom said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women take full part in them and are included in all parts of the election process.
The Afghanistan Regional Council and Presidential Elections will be held on 5.4.2017.
Taliban has posed threats to elections at the same time as international forces are shifting to an advisory role.
This year’s elections are the first time that power is transferred peacefully from a democratically elected government to another government.
Haysom said that the women’s contribution strengthens Afghanistan’s democracy.
According to the independent election committee of Afghanistan, there are 1.2 million women from 3.6 million registered voters.

The flood of certain types of tourists threat to the culture of the region
The authorities consider limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The rage of the locals is particularly focused on the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and fleece" tourism: the destination is only a few hours and is rushed through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is a smother of quick day trips to the city for tourists.
The narrow streets are hard to move around and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer be accommodated.
They have been forced to move further away from the historical centre, while hotels have been replaced by homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities consider restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon a poor quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
You’ll follow the ticketing guide from Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and St. Mark’s Square, and turn back, describes the Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini’s prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the activities of the place, shops and workshops.
We need to keep this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in Venice's historic centre.
St. Mark's Basilica is located on the edge of the market square.
Local indignation is also mainly targeted at cruise ships.
Venice’s historic centre is home to 50 000 locals.
In 1951, the population was about 175 000.
In July, approximately 2 000 Venetians showed their minds against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment, and drives residents away.
Approximately 2 000 inhabitants leave every year.
If this continues, after a few years in Venice there will be no more than tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical catastrophe, says Carlo Belframe, who had been in the system for demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as vessels bring the income it urgently needs to Venice and create a need for numerous jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it has been planned that cruisers would go further from the centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, would certainly change the situation if the administrative district of Veneto, where Venice is located, would have more power to decide on their own things - unless fully autonomous.
Approximately 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
On the highway, bad miles of congestion
On the road between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the north lane has had the congestion of kilometers from work on Thursday afternoons.
In the area, the coating of the motorway is carried out, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
There is a 50-kilometre hourly speed limit for road works instead of the usual 120-kilometre hourly speed.
However, even in the 50-kilometre-limited area traffic had progressed in places on Thursday afternoon at practically speed of walking.
Roadwork progressed on Thursday afternoon on the Siilinjärvi side of the statue of Revelation, the golden goat.
I get along well without such attention
A 23-year-old runner has noticed the publicity of the curses.
Amalie Iuel has published great pictures of herself, among others, of the Grand Canyon landscape.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has risen to a recommendation as an athlete in her current country in Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre run in March by touring the track at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-metre hurdle run to 55.38.
Iuel, who uses social media hard, soon after his record, noticed that fame and publicity have their shadows.
Men all over the world began to send pictures of their genitals to Iue apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close her Snapchat account outside of her.
I got a lot of "dirty pictures" from strangers, so I had to change my account to private, Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he got.
You can probably guess, Iuel chuckled.
It is nice to get feedback after running, but I get along well without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish, father a Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family first moved to Namibia due to her father’s work, then to Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in their turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he switched to Norwegian citizenship in Denmark.
In Norway, Iuel trains under the guidance of three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, coaches ask nothing but just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norway’s records of 400 metres and 400 metres in a fence run.
The foot injury took snowboarder Janne Korpe’s entire career to the stake - now included in the World Championships: “Nice when nothing happens”
Now it's been nice to count when you haven't happened anywhere!
Janne Korpi, one of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, 31, has again enjoyed his beloved sport.
Last summer, the continuation of the career was at stake.
The strain injury had forced Korpi to the operating table in January, and the foot did not want to heal at all.
The hand had also taken a hit in the race slope.
In the summer I didn’t know anything I did, whether the boarding continued or not.
Sponsor deals were out of the way and many things were open, Korpi says.
But it is said that things tend to be organized.
The foot improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull back to the slope.
The follow-up decision was then easy.
I knew it no later than when I first visited the snow.
I was a damn, this is so much fun again, still being pulled through a couple of ways.
Korpi was able to calculate properly only in September-October, but after a long decline, training as painless has been a big deal.
There are only a few races in Korpi.
It does not matter.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding to Korve.
I have never counted because of one race.
I think it’s frustrating to aim for four years at one race, and then you’re on fever for that week.
I can't think so," Korpi says.
Today Korpi competes in halfpipe of the Spanish World Cup held in Sierra Nevada.
Even though individual races don’t like him for boarding, he always lights up with a lot of company.
According to Korvi, the appreciation of the competitions organised by the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, although some of the riders chose Norway’s X-Games, which is held at the same time.
Yes, these are important competitions, the visibility is big.
However, I always think that appreciation depends on the conditions and level of the competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the 12-member Finnish team in Sierra Nevada.
The team’s youngsters, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkinenniemi, are 14 years younger.
It’s nice to watch younger friends go by.
I remember when I myself was at that point that everything was new and was so sick of everything.
It also brings itself a new flow, Korpi thinks.
I still keep up with the slopes somehow, but otherwise I don't, that's what's on my friends' power!
Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career in the background of his snowboarding career.
The son of director legend Pekka Korve is hooked on race sports: the snowboarder has his own racehorses for which he makes training programmes.
When I’m on a trip all the time, there’s no more time for it to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at the nutritional results and usually some departures as well, Korpi says.
According to Korvi, harness racing and harness harness racing are a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end.
I don’t want to plan so far, but it’s at least a likely option.
I feel it so that a bit like studying it here alongside snowboarding.
I try to keep up with the time and develop, in the summer there may be something going on.
If it is my future profession, then it will not be difficult to start when it is already inside the sport.
There is also an Elitloppet cruise with presenter Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that will head to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet race.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to resurrect the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well to trade, and people have been excited.
Now we are already at the point that at least there is no bankruptcy.
It’s still a few months, let’s hope that the ship will be full,” Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo’s care home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new 41-seat elderly care home built in Kitee.
Building of more than 1 700 storeys square meters will be completed next summer on the other side of Health Centre’s neighbour Health Road.
In Kitee, the general topic of wonder is what a new care unit is enough for customers, as now, during Siun Sote, many private care homes are experiencing a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services, comments that Kitee will have more demand in the future not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Attendo bought Kanervikkola and Eerikka private care homes from Kitee last year.
The transaction concerned business, but there is a five-year lease of the properties.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations away from these premises.
More on the topic today later.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie’s brand factory in Scotland
The Trade Union seeks confirmation from the directors of the McVitie’s biscuit manufacturer for long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the British General Trade Union (GMB) Department of Scotland, the company has not announced its plans for the future of Tollcross’s factory.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products factory has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, the owner of the McVitie’s brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives are “speakably the first” if there are changes in operations.
In a letter to the Plant Manager, GMB urges the company to ‘response the concern that no funding has been allocated to the modernisation of production lines’.
Drew Duffy, the GMB trade union, finds it very worrying that the factory manager will not have clear information about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plans.
Families have worked here from generation to generation, with a strong focus on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area, a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of job, wages and livelihood, Brexit, rising costs of living and continual reduction of production, East Glasgow needs successful McVitie’s production badly.”
According to Pladis’ spokesman, the director of the factory had received the trade union letter only on the previous day and the company responds directly to the letter, because it values continuous interaction with employees and representatives of the trade union.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, when we talked openly about several questions.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we continuously evaluate all our businesses and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness.”
According to the spokesperson, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, especially in its production lines and operational improvement.
We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production facility and will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we intend to make changes to the factory’s operations.”
Did PSG Barcelona be warned about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Compared
Paris Saint-Germain does not waive Neymar's intention to reach the end of the £189 million remittance contract, but did PSG Barcelona warn the record remittance three years ago?
The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for the transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half a month, when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him over £500K of weekly salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about the activities of PSG and the way Neymar has left the club by force, and a source near Barcelona tells that Neymar has been very well looked after by the club since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that it was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelafi warned PSG's best clubs for players.
I’m not worried because they know that if they are looking for our players, we’ll become their opponents and contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they are looking for our players, they will have to face consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have just committed this: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Compared earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it wouldn’t let the Italian go under any circumstances, and it might well be that Barcelona loses its star player Neymar for this reason.

NOW: Trump's annealed calls were invented - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two calls referred to by President Donald Trump of the United States never took place, says New York Times magazine.
Trump’s calls with both the President of Mexico and the leader of the Scouts’ Association have proved to be invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had taken place.
He said, however, that Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the Scout leaders spoke personally to Trump, and with President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico Trump had discussed at the G20 Hamburg.
I wouldn’t say it was a lie, it’s a pretty hard accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn’t just happen on the phone, but face-to-face, Sanders explained.
Speech to the scouts aroused resentment
On Monday, Trump reported that the President of Mexico called him and praised Trump for the successful eradication of illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will come across the southern border of Mexico anymore, because they will know that the trip to the US border in any case.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a press release saying that the call has not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump aroused his speech at a large meeting of the National Scouts’ Association in West Virginia.
I received a call from the leader of the scouts, he said it was the finest speech that has ever been given to them.
They were very grateful,” Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Scout Association announced that it was not aware of the call of any of its leaders to Trump.
According to the press release, the former statement of the organization leader Michael Surbaugh, in which he had asked Trump to apologize to the scouts, speaks for himself.
Trump’s speech at the Scout Association’s meeting sparked a lot of surprise, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he awoke the results of the last autumn’s presidential election.
