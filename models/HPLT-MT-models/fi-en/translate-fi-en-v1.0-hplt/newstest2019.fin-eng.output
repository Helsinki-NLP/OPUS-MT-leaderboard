Eemeli Kouki led to the hurricane's home win at the opening - Savo Volley wins 2nd
As many as seven times in a row, Hurricane-Loimaa, who was awarded the men’s volleyball championship medals, started the season with a 2018-19 home win when Raisio’s Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
The general player Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most powerful of Hurricanes at 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they did not happen, and then came a call from Loimaa.
It was pretty fast to get things done,” Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Tomi Rumpunen also played in Loimu with support for Kouki with 18 points.
The most efficient for the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo 17 points, a national match-specific match-specific matchmaking team hack.
The win in the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the opposing player as well, and it brought extra extra to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but the continuation of the medallion is of course a goal, Kouki said.
Mute the most effective Savo Volley
Miro Määttänen was the most efficient in Savo Volley’s 18 points when the team overthrown Vieremä Vantaan Ducks 3-0.
Our game was volatile especially at the attack head, but fortunately we were able to squeeze the win.
At least I had no conscious download when I played against my former team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä Volleyball in 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, i.e. the atmosphere in the ceiling all the time.
A good feeling was left at home.
Miro was a king, Silli also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala’s previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielavesi’s Sammo when Tuovinen was also the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most powerful Ducks with 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley's star
Joni Mikkonen, who won the 2012-13 league points exchange, has also started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season opening victory after defeating the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well on its own.
Today, of course, there was a defeat close by, as we were the fourth instalment in the loss of 17-21.
They dug some victories, and the fifth batch came," Mikkonen said.
A few months ago, the most powerful of the Tigers in the finals was the 28 points scored by Chipper Edvarts Buivids.
Man of land Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
We didn’t get much of a grip on the guy’s chipper,” Mikkonen praised.
Finland world number one in the comparison of human capital
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, says science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst ranked in the comparison.
When measuring human capital, the population’s level of education, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has outlined that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico under control, local game ended in goalless
Real Madrid’s goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched out to combat glory, and the local Madrid team match ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish soccer league.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but the Belgian watcher Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois played three seasons at Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
In the beginning of the week, FIFA chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale got the best goal, but his shot was over at the end of the half-opening of the goal.
After a break, Bale was replaced because of the femur.
According to ESPN, the disappointed Real fans shouted in the match the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the goalteller who moved to Juventus.
The United States is now attacking abortion law - a powerful document tells why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected by President Donald Trump’s nominated candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh’s decisive voice could be reversed by a decision, known as Roe Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern's and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights show how the current situation has become over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against a safe abortion and has received various degrees of support from the majority of our national representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, the gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas is found to be the only physician to make abortions in the state of Missouri due to the tightening of the laws.
The armed guard of the clinic states that he defends the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos are reminiscent of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let’s go to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the association of Lutheran church officials guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The grounds of the interviewed pastor are good, but they are not really needed, a photo of a woman who died in a self-made abortion is enough.
Deaths in the United States were about 5000 years.
The legality of abortions was defended in particular by the Republican Party.
Already in 1967 in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, began a revolutionary mix of religion with politics to cuddle voters.
His abortion stock was also spun by his successor, ­George Bush, the senior.
And the same was done by Donald Trump.
The document reaches the deepest core of the issue when it is looking for a bottom line for the politicization of the abortion issue.
When racial separation from profitable religious organisations was denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a hobby horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary nodes to politics.
When writing this in the United States, there is a situation in which the president, who has spurred by his sec­sual harassment but caught the sound of the religious right in his abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court’s candidate, which is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh may have the power to determine the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on the scales language.
Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, among two children - at the border with great demonstrations
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year after Israel has fired protesters in the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, says the Ministry of Health of Palestine.
According to the Ministry of Health of Palestine, there are two children among the dead: 12 and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened the fire and struck the border zone when the protestors threw Israeli forces with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has begun to use force, that protesters do not break down the frontier fence or try to reach the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the Gaza demonstrations since March, when Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, 12 000 wounded.
The protesters demanded that Palestinian families have access to areas from which Palestinians had to leave when the Israeli State was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty kick - didn't get to shoot himself
Wigan's Topper Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a tack from behind in the penalty area.
The referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, tackling was clean.
Teemu Pukki could not believe his eyes.
The situation seemed to be troubling the referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when he was defeated.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic shaked a 1-0 win goal.
He has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in a stylish chest muscle.
The work tasted like Pukki again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created goals situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There is a five-win tube on the back.
Pedophile assistance service was immediately filled with reservations - about 40 000 people in Finland are interested in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
So far, those who have sexual interest in children or young people have been difficult to get help.
The joint project of the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo (SeriE) trains professionals for dealing with pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in spring, an email flood and appointment times were booked very quickly in the Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
The sexual preference of children causes many people to be ashamed.
The majority of those who notice pedophilic feelings in themselves have not fulfilled their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also make normal life more difficult, says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist at Yle, who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Chore leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the President of the United States Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites to win the prize based on betting odds.
The background is Trump’s role in making North Korea at least at the level of speeches to commit to nuclear disarmament.
According to the odds, the biggest favourites for the Nobel Peace Prize are the President of South Korea Moon Jae-in and the President of North Korea Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace treaty between their countries.
Warming up the gaps between the hoops is significant, as last year the gaps were still very good.
Yet, for years, Kim, who leads with nuclear weapons, has been honed and landed with iron, would undoubtedly raise criticism.
Nobel Prize laureates will be announced from Monday, and on Friday it will be the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those who have participated in the diplomacy of the Korean Peninsula, one of the top candidates is the Congolese physician Denis Mukwege.
The respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in his hospital and has become the leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege’s work has paid attention to sexual violence, which is a creepy by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been the UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has announced that there will be 331 candidates to receive the prize this year.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed.
Trump himself wouldn’t mind if he had the Nobel.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House if he felt he deserved a peace award.
Everyone thinks of it, but I wouldn’t say it myself,” Trump said with a smile.
I want to get this ready.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued, referring to the North Korea negotiations.
However, there are factors that make Trump’s Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often recognized individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multi-polar world order - exactly the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as its opponent.
In the 2000s, three US politicians have been awarded, all of whom have been democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
The remuneration of Trump would therefore require an ideological full translation from the Nobel Committee.
Fire alarm in the tunnel: The motorists behaved like concourses and drove in the wrong direction
Traffic chaos in Lohja on the road Ykköstie took place on 8 September.
Due to the notification, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened because there are motorists on the road who are shocking and they are driving how the firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen on duty told STT at that time.
At that time, the motorway was started to drive even in the wrong direction only after a while of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow, Traffic Safety’s contact manager Tapio Heiskanen marvels.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must only stop for a compelling reason.
Liikenneturva reminds that in exceptional situations, traffic cannot be endangered with emergency solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always provide the most accessible access possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is particularly forbidden, as is making a U-turn and cancelling.
The same prohibitions are also valid in tunnels, where the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without compelling reasons is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
Recently there have been even cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for that activity,” Heiskanen says in the Finnish Transport Safety Agency’s release.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party even though the ship was caught in the lake bottom
The Ilves fans carried by the inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay on board even though the ship had been caught in the lake bottom by its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship’s captain at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, who was on his way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted away from his route late Saturday night and was caught in Vanajavesi in Akaa.
19 passengers on board and five crew members were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was injured in the Haver.
The fans of Ilves would have liked to continue their celebrations on board until morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them by the fire department to the port and bus home," said Syrjä to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following Ilves and HPK’s match, which ended with Ilves’ 4-3 victory.
According to Syrjä, Saturday’s hover was caused by the water’s surface in Vanajavesi being about half a meter lower than usual.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest bus sign was covered with log droppings, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more prominent collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi strait after the ferry route had crossed the highway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama about the case, as the speed of the vessel at the time of the event was very low and the strike at the bottom did not result in a more prominent collision.
According to Syrjä, catching to the bottom has not caused any leaks or pressures on the ship, and thus the cruises on the ship continue as normal.
The diver visited the ship's condition on Saturday morning before the ship began to be towed off the shallow.
For the sake of certainty, we will still visit the shipyard to check that this does not cause any damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that M/S Tampere’s next cruise booked for next weekend can be taken care of as agreed.
According to him, the cruise season continues until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department received an alert on the Saturday night after just half a dozen.
The port of Viiala was alerted to ambulances to accept evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
The on-call firefighter Matti Willman told late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and quite strong winds.
After half past three Sunday nights, the Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced that all passengers on board were evacuated and transferred to Tampere by bus.
Built in 1957, the cruiser has been restored in 2001 and 2017.
Trump’s candidate for judges who have been accused of harassment and drinking may be deprived of top office
Brett Kavanaugh, a judge of the U.S. Supreme Court, may well be deprived of his position, says Mika Aaltola, Programme Director at the Finnish Institute for International Affairs.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up serving another person.
In the United States, even in the past, the president’s candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a lot of contradictions.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
Thus the President has been able to maintain his face.
The appointment would bring the democrats to the lair
The U.S. Supreme Court strives to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
According to Aaltola, if Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to fall into the democratic party’s ballot in the upcoming mid-term elections.
It would raise voting enthusiasm among young people and women who would more likely vote for democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The appointment does not take place for every presidential term, as the judges of the Supreme Court in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of about 70-80 years.
Some of the Republicans hesitated to call
The judges of the U.S. Supreme Court will also normally be subject to a background study, says Aaltola.
Even though Trump has ordered only a week for FBI’s supplementary investigation, Aaltola says that it can still highlight something essential.
Yes, it might bring.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or incompatibility with the office will still be discussed livelyly before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in the Senate, but at least two female Republicans are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be taken to a vote and the Republicans would disappear.
Woman identified Salisbury as agent of suspected military intelligence
A Russian woman has told BBC that she has identified a Russian man suspected of being poisoned by Salisbury as an agent in the Russian military intelligence service.
On the basis of the photographs, the woman explained that it is a military inquiry about Anatoli Tshepiga working at GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia said that they had previously revealed one of the suspected men of poisoning as Chepiga.
Already before, they said that they had found evidence that the current identities of men are identities.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East near the Russian-Chinese border village where Chepiga grew up.
The woman living in the village recognized the young Tshepigan Bellingcat for her images.
He recognized the same man in British police images, in which a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok neural poison in March.
The scrippes survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded the honorary stamp of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia still disputes the suspected GRU connection.
In September, men suspected of poisoning reported in an interview with Russian TV that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Elderly as throwing bags in the health and social services reform
A living example of what the change limit of the social and health care reform defined by the Sipilä government means in practice has now been obtained.
The health and social services of my municipality, Vaala, are produced by Oulunkaari Joint Municipal Authority, whose former Regional Director of Attendo was elected as the Director of Health Services in 2016.
The leaders of the joint municipal authority warn the council of the change limiter.
If social and health care expenditure is now rising, municipal government subsidies will be cut in the future.
The municipal central decision-makers were alarmed, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in elderly care, which would end the institutional care of the health centre’s inpatient ward and a small unit of people with memory disorders.
Home care would be increased, which means that the elderly living in the remote villages are tore their roots next to the health centre to be treated "at home".
Attendo relied on the municipality to pay its customers.
The left of the light did not swallow the bad preparation, but arranged a good public event, which became a lot of relatives, caregivers and also delegates of other parties.
I introduced the health and social services provincial preparation on the slides, how the municipality of Vaala is currently treating the elderly at home most throughout Northern Ostrobothnia.
Also included were the neighboring councillor Carina Läntinen.
The local newspaper made a big deal of the event, and it raised the preparations for Oulunkaari on its hind legs.
The social and health care professionals do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new care home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for the residents.
There are no other service providers.
The preparers only talk about the service voucher, but they do not tell what level of care it provides or what kind of personnel structure Attendo should take care of the elderly until the end of their care.
Without a nurse?
The place of establishment of the health centre is stopped because there is no doctor’s night care.
Attendo will also resort to the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
The Vaala example shows how the officials of the city centre run with inadequate information and the authorized ones are placed against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the central party will empty the residents of Vaala, because who will remain there unsafe to live voluntarily if there is a possibility to move out.
Was one of the electoral statements in the city centre that the whole country was kept inhabited?
Erdogan, President of Turkey, opened a grand mosque in Cologne
In Cologne, Germany, thousands of people showed their minds when the country’s visiting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of Europe’s largest mosque.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine from the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the protesters’ signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan’s visit on Thursday, several demonstrations have been held, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10 000 people were expected to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
Erdogan's supporters had also gathered in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised that his visit to Germany was successful and estimated that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel swore on Friday that they would reconstruct the relations of the countries, which have deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup attempt in 2016.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep disputes between the countries, for example with regard to human rights issues.
Review surrounds the visit
Both Henriette Reker, Mayor of Cologne and Armin Laschet, Prime Minister of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, cancelled their participation in the opening when a review of Erdogan’s visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu said that he had come to a demonstration against Erdoga from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go out on the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the last stop of Erdogan’s trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is Turkish.
In Slovakia, three charges for the murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been accused of the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor reported that three people are accused of the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February, as well as of other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the investigation of the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found in February, shot with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and Italian mafia.
The police have suspected that the murders are related to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and Kuciak’s article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
Karelian distribution may have problems on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to printing faults, Sunday’s Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas, where the distribution of common boxes must be carried out from the outer memory.
The situation was the same for the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting puts extra bouquets in the province.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will be mailed separately on Mondays.
The delivery of these newspapers is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Editor Arto Nyberg is currently interviewing Vesa Heilala in her forthcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is telling about his upcoming space travel, which he booked from Virgin Galactic back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, the payment of which required a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space long ago.
However, the day of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unsuccessful test flight that took place in 2014 and claimed the death victim, things are in a good state.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will still start this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, so his journey takes about a year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at a height of 100 kilometres, the Finnish astronaut tells about the future on his website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book entitled Space Journey and saw the Star Trek series on TVs.
The wars of the stars have been seen, and that’s why the idea...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host
Manchester City continued its undisputed course in the Premier League as it crashed on Saturday in its homefield with Brighton's goals 2-0.
The dominating champions are Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth match of the season to an empty finish when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute at the rear post of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he saw the Brighton defense with Sterling into pieces in the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentines were able to place 2-0 final figures on the penalty spot easily.
With six wins and one draw, City leads the Premier League with a 19-point catch.
However, Liverpool, who played less than one game, is only one point away.
Liverpool face off on a Saturday night in their seventh round match of the series three Chelsea.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö for his surprise at Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss magazine Blick, Mersu’s British driver asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton during the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel at the World Championship points with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari reported that Räikkönen will not continue in the stable next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen would hit the gloves at the counter.
I don’t think Kim changes in the remaining races.
She is an exceptional professional - fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It makes no sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told him that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of formula number one, I played F1 on PlayStation all the days.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy,” Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian race.
The Mercedes Valtteri Bottas starts from pole position at 14 o’clock.
Iltalehti will follow the race from a moment.
The football A-long championship championship became a full farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top league level of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before 13 a.m. the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy is practically enough for the first place against Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to turn in the final round, Ilves, second in the championship, must win PK-35 and wish for the defeat of the Lahti residents.
However, the Lahti championship was confirmed in practice even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less Vaasa people, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
On the break the Lahti residents led 7-0.
One reason for the defeat of Vaasa residents is that the team has played the same A-young SM-series, i.e. the P20 series and the men’s group Kakkonen C.
Vasa IFK has played in Kakkonen against the fall of the whole season.
On Saturday the final round of Kakkonen’s final round, Vasa IFK is forced to win the JBK away game and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own away game against KuFu in Toivala in Siilinjärvi.

Serena Williams flashes in a video where she sings in topless - campaigns for breast cancer awareness
The tennis superstar Serena Williams is shuddering again.
Now he is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on his Instagram account, where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, says the news agency AFP.
The song is the 1991 hit by Australian artist The Divinyls, I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
I recorded The Divinyls’ global hit to remind women to perform regular self-service [breast] checks,” Williams writes in his Instagram post.
And yes, this set me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of the skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it saves many lives.
Chrissy Amphlett died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
Music video is part of the I Touch Myself project made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the comments of the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams previously opted out of the Beijing Tennis Tournament this week.
The background is the buzz of the US open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the match and claimed, among other things, that men were accepted for much worse than female players.

Korpela runs out today: How everything ends
Everything good will end in time.
Today it happens to the Finnish country drama Korpela’s alley run, which has been held quite well.
The third season of production has gone like hot stones: last week, the television premiered in 722 000 Finnish.
The top figures in themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there is no continuation of the series by Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirku are again taking a good leap forward, and Jaska’s mother is the first to guess what will happen.
Even between Anssi and Miisa are warm, in the light of recent events romantically, but then Laiho appears in the patterns once again.
The police, too, are in a skeptical position with regard to a bony man.
None of you can foresee the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets to hear amazing news.
The last will of the remote is revealed, which brings the woman to the brink of tears.
After a week, Sorjonen will continue on Sunday evenings with new episodes.
Korpela Alley Run on TV1 at 21.05.
Should I go to work tomorrow in a small flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many people guess whether to stay at home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worth others to go to get infected, as the disease can be contagious even if your own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms feel small, says Prevention publication.
So should you stay at home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus infects the day before the symptoms begin and from there to five days a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can return to work when your cough relieves and there is no fever anymore, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast return to the gym to slow recovery.
Don’t forget to wash your hands, put them on a handkerchief and throw them into the trash.
Sore for movement, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses in check, but keeps the user aware of the head area.
Then the fingers should not be put on the nose or in the mouth, Poland says.
The sneezes are also limited to the mask.
So how to avoid infections?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats the mistraditional: "My husband is a hockey player"
A hockey player and misses are often combined.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, at 23.
Alina Voronkova, originally from Pertunmaa, has been awarded the 2018 Miss Finland’s crown for her cubs.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved to at the age of 15.
Alina’s mother is ingrian Finns and her father is Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school because of the Russianness of the father.
Mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was tempted because of my Russianness.
I had no friends at all in Pertunmaa, says Alina at a semi-finalist event.
After middle school Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the Miss Beauty found new friends and everyday life started rolling as hoped.
At the age of 15, I think that I was an adult, but I wasn’t really thinking about this later.
Three years ago Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurri, familiar from Pelicans.
After a career in the Finnish Championship, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Championships.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived almost a year in a remote relationship, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I got into a winning trio and then a career would go on for me, I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we had to live separately, we have good trust and the good thing about the remote relationship is that it will keep up with the initial spark all the time, Alina grinned in May.
Rejoicing continuous growth, death at our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the resilience of the earth.
Still, you don’t want to give up just about anything.
Sustainable options are sought for continuous growth, but even the theory of moderation is facing major problems.
The continuous growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that before could only be dreamed of.
However, the long-term overrun of the earth’s carrying capacity and climate change make this foundation of the market economy threateningly shake.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday’s night in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at four in the morning.
A man born in 1986 was severely injured by stabbing and a second, born in 1968, less severely.
Older men have already been admitted from the hospital.
The police have arrested one person whose possible share of the stabbing is investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect related to the events.
Events are investigated as a attempt at killing and aggravated assault.

We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but luckily the paint of the Turku residents brought us more strongly into the game.
Home team Inter's head coach, John Allen, said the game was in control, but scoring again brought pain.
One defensive mistake took us a full point pot, Allen was annoyed.
Again we were the best!

Finland is the best country in the world if you measure it with human capital.
Finland ranked number one in a study that measured citizens’ health and education and learning.
The study measured the change in capital from 1990 to 2016.
The study was published by The Lancet.
According to the summary, human capital has a significant impact on how the national economy can grow in the future.

The magazine showed its underpower skills, the venue is not yet sure
Jori Lehter's strong underpower play emerged when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played his last training before the season began.
Philadelphia defeated Boston 4-1, and Lehter fed Michael Raffl twice to score.
In recent days, Lehterä has been on display due to drug suspicion.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehtirä is one of the 23 suspects in drug narcotics, in which a part is suspected of drug use and a part of sales, for example.
The newspaper has denied that it has committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the topic, and the NHL is investigating the case.
After the match, Sam Carchidi, the editor of Philadelphia Inquirer, who closely follows the Flyers, estimates that Lehter is part of a group of six forwards, five of whom will get a seat in the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehtire was excellent in the training match.
In the second round, Lehtire fought the disc with a substantive force, drew the defender and fed the Raffl in front of the goal to the open position.
For the second time, the duo's cooperation brought the goal at the very end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL season with a guest match against Las Vegas on 4 October.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakainen is waiting for the team’s coaching management to decide if he or she can join the NHL group.
I found the training camp good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide whether to play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL," said Vaakainen in an interview with Boston on Twitter.
In the river boys, Vaanainen played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
With Boston paint, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.
Flies-backed defender Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit with overwhelming power when the team knocked Toronto 5-1.

Oilers rested, for example, on Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koskinen.
Florida's Alexander Barkov played for over 20 minutes and fed a goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2

Fresh picture shows change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of kilograms
Eddie Hall, crowned the world’s strongest man in 2017, is going through a striking makeover.
British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the strongest man in the world for a long time and determinedly.
Hall could eat up to 10 000 kilocalories of food a day and weighed up to 200 kilograms, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were in size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted damage to his body.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted the world’s strongest man for victory by all means and the family man promised to end his career if he gets the title.
Hall did not want his children to grow without his father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen in the 2018 World’s Strongest Man Games held in April.
On Instagram, Hall recently published a picture in which he poses significantly in a slimmer condition than his active career.
Hall writes its current weight to be 169.5 kilograms.
Hall wrote that he is now training five times a week aerobicly.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world, was weighed by Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, who was also known as the Game of Thrones TV series.
The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed to Pyhäjärvi - "Strongly closed on a rocky place"
The inland waterway M/S Tampere drove off late on Friday evening in Lake Pyhäjärvi in Akaa.
The rescue department received an alert for a water traffic accident on Friday evening after half-past twelve.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has drifted to the rocks, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rocks, described the on-call firefighter Matti Willman.
The ship had 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the Rescue Department, personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they will be moved by bus towards Tampere,” said Jari Nieminen, Head of Emergency Services, to STT after one o’clock at night.
The port of Viiala was alerted to ambulances to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted away from its route to the west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police investigate the cause of the events.
The on-call firefighter Matti Willman told us earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and quite strong winds.
According to the rescue department, the fate of the vessel is unclear.
Obviously, the ship does not leak.
After the evacuation operation, divers start checking the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is a vessel currently operating as a restaurant vessel with a maximum number of passengers of 180.
The vessel also has a private meeting room for rent.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
A boxer Robert Helenius’s evening match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a conflict of money.
Ilta-Sanomat today reported on a challenge application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius and his late-payment interest will be charged a total of more than EUR 80 000 unpaid manager fees.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We have tried to reconcile, but there is no other option.
There has been a clear assignment here, and there has been a lot of work done, says Kokkila to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius’ current manager Markus Sundman sent a response to Iltalehti to tell the boxer’s view of the events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the respondents, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in an economically difficult situation to Helenius and promised to be able to arrange games and sponsorship income for him.
It had been agreed verbally that Helenius is obliged to pay only percentages of its matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius does not have to pay anything, only receive the income they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice in professional sports management.
The salary work has never been agreed upon and it would also have been absurd in Helenius’s situation, Sundman explains in his message.
The cooperation was never signed in writing.
According to the reply, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft done until the end of 2014.
He stated that the proposal was bad on its own and broke the cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius was not once in contact with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the cooperation ended, Helenius had been shown an unindividual but significant decrease in the manager’s work.
This year, the same claims have been brought.
Helenius considers Helminen’s and Kokkila’s retroactive activities to be cowardly, the response states.
Today, Helenius meets Erkan Teperi, the seventh contender in the heavyweight series of the boxing federation IBF in Stuttgart.
Hearty man and good reporter
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew that the late radio presenter and journalist Erkki Päll had spent decades.
The radio presenter and journalist Erkki Pälli died of uncured liver cancer at the age of 83.
The death report of the presenter was published in Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
The notification states that Pälli had died on 3 September.
He reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the acquaintance’s fate.
He left on Facebook earlier as a farewell,” says Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers Erkki Päll as a multi-talented expert who became a great supplier.
He remembers that Päll was a kept person with fast phoots and fun stuff.
I learned to know Erkki already as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouseman.
We got to know Erkki at the time.
He was then a Finnlevy spokesman and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I proceeded to make albums as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a standard editor at all parties to do stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight to the skin of his interviewees.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
For many, she became known as the respected Yle radio host, but she also wrote great news stories.
Erkki also interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked not only in supplier work, but also in the Fazer record company Toivo Kärki.
He worked as a music producer on the albums of Vesa-Matti Loiri.
However, the biggest passion of the pall was radio work, where he had a unique style.
She has been working on radio since the 1960s, and she became familiar to numerous listeners in Yle’s ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the financial year that ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The union describes an experienced "full translation" of its financial situation, although the economy is burdened by a "relevant debt in the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the quick response and strict financial discipline.
Last autumn, we reacted as quickly as possible, making adjustments.
The careful planning and financial management of our operations has been impacted throughout our entire organisation,” Kulmala says in a press release.
We have also succeeded well in partner procurement, and in addition, the return on the world cup was the maximum in the past competition season.
However, in the future, the cost management must also be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then came silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of the hospital in the town of Palu on Indonesian Sulawesi Island.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled to assess the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to exterminations.
One of the people who moved in the hospital area was a 52-year-old returner Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he is lost.
I last talked to him when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news agency AFP.
In the yard of the Army Hospital in Palu was Dwi Haris, who was injured on his back and arm.
He was at the start of the quake in the local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited to the return wedding party.
I probably had to squeeze under the wall that collapsed.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don’t know what has happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe," said Haris to AP, according to the British media.
Small shops robbed
The 35-year-old baby’s mother Risa Kusuma tried to calm down her hot baby at the evacuation centre.
He described the moods in the city as being tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are plundered everywhere,” Kusuma said.
Many of the residents of Palu have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house is so erect, possible exterminations could destroy it and bury the residents.
According to the news agency AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu’s prison escaped after the walls of the prison collapsed.
There were about 560 prisoners known to be prisoners, so there may be about 300 escapers.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the magazine, the prisoners became enraged and fired the prison after the guards had forbidden them to go to search for their relatives who had suffered from earthquake and tsunami.
The airport of Palu has been reopened mainly for assistance flights.
Among the first ones, the C-130 transport machine from the army landed on the field, bringing assistance supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are limited.
Pilots are forced to land without the assistance of air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was severely damaged in an earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night against Sunday, the whole country spread a long rain area from the west, says the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The rain mostly comes in water, but in Central and Northern Lapland there is a wait for sleet or snow.
The cold weather of the previous night is not recurring, because the temperatures under the cloud cover remain higher.
A cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures under control.
Just in the west, we can go to the frozen side for a moment,” said the on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sundays, the rainy area will recede in the east direction during the morning.
In the south and west there are cascading or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures move all the way up to the height of Oulu in stages of 10-13 degrees.
The coming week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and waves warnings apply in sea areas.
The actual autumn storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise the typical autumn weather is expected.
Yes, the autumn is starting to push on quite seriously," Ilkka said.
Miss Suomi finals not seen on TV
From IL-TV you can watch the red carpet glamour and sparkle of the Miss Suomi competition.
Iltalehti’s entertainment journalists will broadcast live on the IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final from Billnäs ironworks.
The shipment starts at about 18.50.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned among ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Suomi 2018 final will be held at Billnäs in Raseborg.
Before the final starts, you will be able to follow the atmosphere on site during the IL-TV live broadcast.
The live stream starts at about 18.30 and continues for about an hour.
This year, the final has attracted a lot of Miss Finland winners from previous years.
In the jury they are represented by the 1998 Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus.
Other members of the jury are Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Jounin Kauppa’s CEO Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiska’s news producer Katja Lintunen.
We hoped he would be able to enter the university before going to the missions
Russian Dimitri father and Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in her daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
New Miss Finnish Alina Voronkova’s parents Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova proudly followed her daughter’s first moments at the head of the crown.
They arrived from Pertunmaa and planned to drive back home after the final.
Have a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result I started to feel nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is ingrian and Dimitri Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived all her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than miss careers.
Alina was often told that when she is so pretty she should start as a mischief.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn’t until later that Alina got excited about beauty contests.
The parents’ wish was that Alina would be admitted to the university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
This was the case, and eventually Alina still wanted to do her bachelor’s degree before the race.
We asked last year why he didn’t participate, but he wanted to complete it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be featured, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri is ice hockey in Japan, and she couldn’t encourage her to Finland in the finals.
Alina’s parents believe that the relationship between young people will last for the year.
Yes, it is meant!
The parents hoped that the daughter would soon have time to visit.
Now there has been such a long break during visits due to Mississippi.
It’s already nasty, even if you’ve put in messages.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - an idea of a comic book came to mind: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
My husband’s comment, in which he suggested that it be a person in the story, says Sari Piippo, an Espoo-based comic blogger, a housewife and a former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU translator who made economic and legal matters in Brussels until after the fourth child the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed my time as a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind that what to do when even the smallest child started to be big.
Then 2014, a cartoon came into the picture.
Piippo says that she had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though she had read Donald Duck, Tintin, and Asterix while she was young.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these manuscripts started to emerge, the situation changed.
I made some dozens of manuscripts in the table box at first.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a skilled artist, but I wasn’t able to attract her until the summer of 2016 when I don’t donated Viivi with the help of a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, says Piippo, who says that the record was a great encourager to him.
The graphics board is easy and convenient tool to try to make something happen.
I didn’t even try to draw on paper,” says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually practiced in the evenings.
The manuscripts are constantly popping in, but I usually don’t make it at once.
One strip of three squares takes up to several hours.
I may make a screen at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates Scott Adams’ Dilbert, among others, from the contemporary comics of newspapers.

Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer a forced bun, even though she sometimes feels like it.
Piippo says she reads her series with her husband and children.
After all, it’s such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you’ve drawn and say that I’ve done this today.
And the challenges are enough for the housewife!

Indonesian Earthquake: The air traffic manager sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe
A 21-year-old flight manager, Anthony Gunawan Agung, became the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he could safely transport hundreds of people from an island shaken by an earthquake.
The young man was in command of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While others escaped from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to direct Batik Air's passenger plane from the runway into the air.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport after the earthquake on Saturday.
The air traffic control tower trembled and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he got serious internal organ injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported to a better equipped facility with a helicopter, but he died 20 minutes before the arrival of the helicopter, a representative of the aviation administration told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify once the flight reached the air and was eventually measured to 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian aviation administration has respected the heroism of Agung on social media.
Rehn pondered above the end of Europe to the trade war: "You need to watch the following tweet"
The US-China trade war is reflected in the global economy.
All over Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland also slightly reduced its own economic forecasts.
President and CEO Olli Rehn said in Yle’s first morning that even though the tightening tension has no direct impact on the trade flows in Europe, it weakens trust, which in turn is reflected in companies’ investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
Rehn thinks that Europe is so far its pound.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and has also been able to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's opinion, Europe does not seem to be grinding to the feet of the Trade War.
You have to look at the following tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We have a pretty unforeseen partner in the direction of Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the Western world.
Yesterday, the market reacts drastically to the deficit budget presented by the Italian government on Thursday evening.
The deficit for next year is over 2.4 per cent of the national product.
Rehn considers the situation in Italy worrying.
Five per cent of the country’s loan stock consists of problem loans and more than ten per cent of non-performing loans.
In addition, its public finances are undermined and the country seems to exceed its commitments again in relation to its European partners.
It might not be worth painting yet new crises, Rehn answered when asked if Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another issue that is trying Europe is the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would be in harmony.
The dispute would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started as the Bank of Finland’s President and CEO in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from his position in just over a year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen’s name have flashed in speeches.
It certainly doesn’t matter if Finnish names are involved,” Rehn said and added that he wasn’t going to comment on the matter further.
HS Super-popular Black Box shows will continue next week - last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box shows organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other performances will be performed at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
23 October The black box will visit Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre for sale.
Tampere performance is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers will tell a true story they have prepared for a long time, which has not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There is again something that no one has ever heard.
It's a strange spy in the night in Helsinki, an impressive reportage from across the globe and a talkable story about a very current health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the public will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organised a living journalism evening for three years.
From the start, they have been popular and often sold out.
Over 15 000 people have already visited the auditorium.
The black box was awarded as a journalist of the year at the Bonnier gala.
Rewarders thanked for a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The Black box of the spring season 2019 will be seen at the Finnish National Theatre in March-April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The presentation at that time has different content than in the evenings this autumn.
Lost mushroom found thanks to "an open-minded experiment"
The drone expertise of the Finnish police is one of the top in the world: "We are asked about training"
According to the Rector of the Police University College, the police can use drones in addition to finding missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence tasks.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a lost mushroom in Raahe in just a couple of minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, President of the Police University College, tweeted about the case and mentioned, among other things, that with the help of “an open-minded experimentation and effective education, we are also among the top in the world here”.
Drone is quite a new thing and a whole new one in police positions.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police would be the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong understanding that this is the case though.
This has been clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere,” Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the drone operations of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
Increasingly popular
Himberg points out that finding a lost person in Finland’s winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As stated, in the case of Raahe, a lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are meant to be trained more.
The drone is already being used a lot in police tasks, and their use will become more common and increase in the future.
This is how I would dare to say, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for the lost, the police, according to Himberg, can use drones for example in an accident or crime scene investigation and certain kinds of intelligence tasks.
For example, you already have to check out some area a little further away, where you may be afraid that violence will be encountered there.
Drones can then be used for pre-requisites.
Karelian Rugby rose to number one divari
Karelian Rugby celebrated a 2-division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the game at 7-12 defeats for Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second episode found a plot and scorched the guests in the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew of the historical rise of Karelian Rugby to the 1-division.
Previously, the club has played in number one, but at that time the Finnish rugby league had been divided into two levels, the Finnish SM-series and several divisions.
The club intends to accept a series site, but it knows quite a lot of work for the next winter.
The current twenty-player roster must be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the growth of the number of games and longer game journeys, so fundraising must also be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi to start the season in Montreal, strengthens head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of Montreal Canadiens, who plays in the NHL, confirmed in the club’s Twitter account that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise in Kotkaniemi, 18, with the first round with the number three at the summer booking event.
The forward joined Montreal’s training strength in late summer and has shown strong hold in September’s training matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score in his first training match.
Principal coach Julien praised that Finland had taken major development steps after arriving at the arrival camp.
The NHL regular season begins next week’s anti-Thursday night in Finland.
Montreal meets Toronto Maple Leafs on the opening tour.
What is a good leader like?
This week, a lot of leadership has been discussed in Finland.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia’s Board of Directors, told in an interview with HS about his book Paranoid optimisti, where he shed light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the management of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but even in previous Nokia surveys, the inability of managers to act as a team has been discussed; fear and in speechlessness, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking and agility of the company’s ascent phase disappeared.
During the week, a business giant event Nordic Business Forum was held in Helsinki, which drew the Finnish business cream to Messukeskus.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 business world stars were added to the stage.
There was plenty of talk about good management.
Gary Hamel, the legend of leadership, said that a good leader should dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods retail chain, said that the manager should be able to communicate with the whole staff for the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot only be a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about introverts in the book of success, said that the most successful leaders have been shown to be humble.
They operate calmly, quietly and determinedly.
Often they are introverts.
Professor of Finance Aswath Damodaran reminded that the characteristics of a good leader must be aligned with the stage of the company’s life cycle.
In the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company’s future is based.
A company that has grown into a mature stage needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons at the Nordic Business Forum were listened to by 7 500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of an information turmoil.
A good manager is required a lot.
Therefore, management often goes wrong, also at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in the back-stage, with a comradely voice.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for an outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak arrived on a wonderful red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spend most of her year abroad
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the missifal in a stunning black dress.
The spectacular dress of 2012 Miss Finland also had a lace sash.
A little poden jet lag.
I came again from Los Angeles.
I largely spend most of my time there, Chafak says about his news.
Chafak says he is going to Los in the test.
Among other things, he has made advertising descriptions.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to Finland.
However, he says that work has to be done harder than before, as the model is always easy to find a replacement.
I have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The Danish police found the Volvo found in a major ­ operation: "We can't tell where"
The extensive search by the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Juutinrauma and Iso-Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Zealand were closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the turn manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The car you are looking for has been found.
We can’t tell where the car was found yet,” says Henrik Storm, in a press release from the Copenhagen police, to Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the search for black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat according to the police.
According to him, the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Extra Bladet told the police about the Saturday press conference.
Investigation Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was in the course of the silent operation.
He did not want to tell what criminal title the matter was being investigated with.
However, Skov said that it is a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people’s lives.
Three people have been sought in the operation.
The police will not tell you if they have already been arrested.
According to the magazine, ferry traffic restrictions have been cancelled.
The Copenhagen police also followed events on their Twitter account.
STT says that, according to the police, the public no longer has a cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people vote on the matter in disputed elections
Macedonia, located in the Balkans, is currently voted as the country’s new name on the proposal.
According to the agreement between Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of North Macedonia would be called.
Until now, Greece has blocked Macedonia’s efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU with its veto.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention the new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
The vote began slowly at least at the school in the centre of Skopje, the capital.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, wished support for the agreement.
A referendum means a change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people," he said.
Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been officially known as the Republic of Former Yugoslavia Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev’s government has campaigned to approve the agreement.
The national right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for boycotting referendum.
In addition to the result, there is plenty of excitement in whether the voting turnout exceeds the required 50 per cent.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
The amendment to the Constitution requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
The polling stations close at night eight times in Finland.
Handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met late Saturday night at Erkan Teper's heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finnish surveyed his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, next to Stuttgart.
The main game of the evening was the Intercontinental title in the heavyweight series of the IBF Association.
The winner can be given the opportunity to take on the tougher tasks seen on Saturday, the economic significance of which must be noted.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, knocking Teper hard with his left hand strike.
Teper was no longer able to get out of the floor.
The "Nordic Nightmare" hit his opponent already in the third installment, when blood began to leak from the German nose.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They had to fight in December 2015.
Teper then appealed to the injury and retired from the match.
After that, it turned out that German had been busted twice in the doping test.
Helenius has named 28 matches in his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches and lost three times in his career.
Hamilton with a stable order for victory - the difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One championship was once again confirmed, as Lewis Hamilton from Mercedes won the Russian Grand Prix and stretched his World Championship lead to Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel already 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position for the race, drove second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas held a top position in mid-competition, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Max Verstappen of Red Bull, who started from the last starting line, was fifth.
The duo abused the Jew in Joensuu - caught a block away
Two men assaulted and kicked 31-year-old jurors in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 18.
According to the police, men also earned the victim’s phone, among other things.
The police reached a suspect, i.e. a 35-year-old man and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, after the event.
They were caught as a suspect in a robbery, the police report.
The victim got bruised injuries that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, President and CEO of the electric car company Tesla, will leave his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company.
Musk has agreed with US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has imposed $20 million in fines on his tweets, according to which he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue as President and CEO of Tesla, but the company must also pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada fights against time to reach an agreement on Naft with the USA
Time threatens to end in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on the Free Trade Agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
The Canadian Chief Negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to fully concentrate on trade negotiations.
President Donald Trump demanded that the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement on Naphta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement with each other, but there has not yet been an agreement with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to enter into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, enters office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that the participation of Canada in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there is a plan to sign a contract at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Due to these schedules, the contract text between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow enough time for the U.S. Congress to assess it.
Neighbor thought candles were blazing to fire in Kaakkuri - fire brigade was alerted to the scene
The candles burned in the apartment building in Kaakkuri in Oulu caused a fire alarm on the night against Sunday.
A dozen rescue department units were alerted due to a possible block of flats.
On the spot, it became clear that the candles burned in the sauna in the apartment had looked like a fire in the opposite house, which was why it had been reported to the emergency response centre.
There was no fire at the property.
Police caught 11 people after a Honka-HJK match - rattling on the ground and at the metro station
The police seized eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match in the men’s football league in Espoo, the Western Uusimaa Police Department’s criminal commissioner Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The basis for the apprehension was protection against crime and disturbance.
The arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
Previously, Ilta-Sanomat told about the catches.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed into the field from the stands reserved for HJK’s supporters.
The situation led to pushing and brawling between team supporters.
In order to stop the situation, e.g. the equestrian police were needed.
In addition to the field, rattling took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the catching events took place.
I wasn’t there, but what I saw from the pictures, the situation was unpleasant,” Värtinen referred to the raging in the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal report has been made as a result of the events.
Table stone evicted the butterfly race of its time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Table Stone have progressed to the finals on the closing day of the 3/7 World Cup races in the Netherlands.
The races are swimn in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS’s Table Stone erupted his Finnish record in a 50-metre butterfly, where he was the second in the early years of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Table stone swam in Helsinki during the SE-time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was the 24th person in the butterfly race of 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatti Laukkanen was 30.48 in the early stages of the 50-metre breast swim and progressed to the final.
In the initial batches of two hundred metres of confusion, Laukkanen was the 15th in the period of 2.14.25.
Students play a rare treat: the ancient tragedy - the simple Oresteia impresses with its visuals
Antique tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stages.
Sofokleen Filoktetes, the last ancient tragedy in 1988, has been seen at the National Theatre.
Now the Theatre Academy brought on a tour from the Finnish National Theatre the only ever-preserved play trilogy, Aishhylos Oresteia.
In the Stages Open! projects that began in 2015, the actors of the Theatre Academy work together with a professional instructor internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia premiered her international premiere in Berlin in April.
The reconciliation of Roiha from Orestia sums up the story of the end of the blood network of the doomed Atreus family and of the birth of the rule of law for twenty minutes, especially by sealing the chorus sections.
The work manages to be very faithful to Kirsti Simonsuur’s fine Finnish translation (2003) for the people.
The dramatic lights and the presentation revealing the sides of the theatre space emphasize the simple and clear stage thinking.
At its core is the dynamics between performers who detach from the choir, who play name roles, and the choir.
Both double and triple degrees from name roles are used in the presentation.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War, and his war prey Kassandra, are also shown on the stage, unlike the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not emphasise being faithful to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, in front of the viewer’s eyes, a modern, faithful interpretation is created, which is constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a rhythmic group of master’s students as a tight group, a very single organism.
In choral sections in particular, actors who tend to be very expressive, sculptural group formations are able to get their rights bare, only on stage decorated with a white curtain.
Impressive.
Oresteia’s performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen load
The novelty will start to be visible in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement between Hyundai and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hannover IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will deliver a thousand vehicle batches of novelties for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By introducing a fuel cell truck to the market, Hyundai will continue on the path marked by the Nexo and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles.
With this first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example, by following the development of the refueling network,” said Hyundai Motor’s Deputy CEO In Cheol Lee at the launch of the contract.
Fists flew several times in Kajaani
A little over thirty-something man abused three men in a restaurant in the center of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first struck one man inside the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the place.
Outside he would push another man to the ground, and, in the absence of a third man, the abuser still struck him.
The police arrested the assaulter.
At the police station, the man still behaved aggressively and kicked another policeman on foot.
The man also threatened the police by assaulting and killing.
The man was taken to the pipe to calm down.
The matter will be investigated as three assaults and the violent opposition of an official.
In the centre of Kajaani, there was also another assault on Välikatu on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaani man struck the victim.
A little later the other man knocked him down, and the man who had hit him before still kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the assaulters further away from the victim and the police were called to the scene.
However, the authors had time to leave before the police arrived.
The police will ask the eyewitnesses of the event to contact the Kajaani police by phone +358 295 416 520 or by email at investigation.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio presenter Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, who was known as a long-term journalist for her, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of unhealed liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is going.
Even the doctor has said it, I live a day at a time, he comments on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
Security of trade aunts and sets must be guaranteed
I was hired for the first time in 1984.
When these annual tyres make a topic of story astonishment, it is usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karelian, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and sometimes even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, working environment expert at the Service Union (PAM).
He says that crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though employers, of course, claim otherwise.
The police are only clearly aware of serious cases and many of the right situations of violence remain unreported.
Of course, companies have an obligation to compile statistics on their near-miss situation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but these statistics will remain for internal use and their data will not be collected for anything," he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in the statistics.
In cases of violence, it has always been a problem that they do not always cause physical injuries.
However, psychological traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the violence situation and the threatening violence situation is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threats must also be considered violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid at their workplace, even if there is no actual act.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were freed up, the media had also seen a significant impact on the safety of the sellers.
At that time, quite a few employers organised guard services for at least nighttime hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this will bring a new negative trend.
When the security incidents remained in good control, the impression was that the security would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions to remove expensive guard services.
Mild assault is an attorney’s offence, and it is quite understandable that the maltreated seller does not want to make an investigation request for a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But according to the same section of the law of 2011, slight assault becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I now need precedents.
The next time an aunt or uncle is abused, the police should investigate and blame the prosecutor.
When the court would put a few of the abusers in prison, and the sentence from there at the hard end of the penalty scale, the habits would be neatened up.
A society where the grocery store must be open in small towns almost overnight must guarantee the safety of the store’s employees.
Heidi Sohlberg wrote to Miss before the live stream began - "Sara, Iiro is married"
Miss crowning this year is not seen on TV in the traditional way, but the broadcast shows the Viafree website.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and host of Viasat and Viaplay’s NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
The host of Backstage and the red carpet is Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio told the invited guests and media representatives about the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a loud applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this male presenter, Sohlberg exuded his colleague as the audience cheered.
Many of the leading competitions are followed by Miss Suomi in previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married then!
Sohlberg slashed looking towards Saras.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to Sieppi, who was just divorced by his throw, who laughed at the comment, although at first it seemed confused.
Sieppi spoke for the first time in Ilta-Sanomat's weekend magazine.
The miss beauty told us that she doesn’t want to open up the reasons for the difference in more detail in public, as it’s a matter between her and Roope Salminen.
He said that he is not in a hurry for a new relationship, but he is going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own stuff and especially I start living my own life alone,” said Sara Sieppi.
Harjula’s matrimonial status came out later when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The presenter threesome laughed at the suede.
After all, Iiro was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi acknowledged the suede.
The Ostrobothnian tortured his tied partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man to prison for three years of crime against his common-law spouse in Kokkola.
The means of crime included a belt, cable and cable ties.
The court condemned the objects in question to be lost to the State.
The accusation of the brute concerned the suspect of aggravated rape.
However, the District Court rejected this accusation.
The reason for the Kokkola employee was four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of freedom, aggravated deprivation of freedom and two damages.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last actions, the man was arrested and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia gave its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
A 34-year-old was also accused of two outrageous deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
These charges, however, were rejected as manifest.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the court judge issued a public statement on the judgment.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted their spouses violence, threatening and coercion in situations where they had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked tobacco, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee on him.
In his judgment, the court ordered the state to lose the means of crime: belt and cable, cable ties, bathrobe belt, knife, and lobster.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued their cohabitation between actions.
It is readable from the sentence that a large part of the most outrageous acts took place at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A total of 5800 euros must be paid to the victim for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm.
He hardly has the money in question, for the convicted person already has debts in debt collection.
The imprisonment is not the man’s first.
Iltalehti does not disclose the name of the sentenced person to protect the privacy of the victim.
At the time of writing, the new District Court is not final.
Europe in four-point lead to Ryder Cup
European golf professionals held their lead on Saturday in a traditional hole game match against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup, which is being played around Paris, with 10-6 points, while on Sunday there are still twelve two-players playing in front.
Europe won three of the four Saturday start four-ball matches, and in the afternoon four-player wins were equalized to 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four of their matches on Friday and Saturday.
No European couple had reached the same level before.
On Sunday, the two aim for more history.
No European player has won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and there have been no more than three players out of the Americans: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in a Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The football league team HJK published a press release on Sunday that condemns the disturbance behaviour of its supporters in a Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
We apologize for any events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the announcement states.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge the dispute with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The security guards were not able to calm down the situation, but police officers and also cavalry police were needed.
HJK announces that the team’s players and officials are shocked by the incident.
Events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
We will make a sharp difference from all activities that compromise the safety of match events," the announcement states.
HJK promises to assist authorities and event organisers in investigating threats and removing minor phenomena.
Supporting culture is part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football stadiums in every way.
Violence is not part of it," the press release says.
Filipino inventor flies a drone car - this is how to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing group in the world who swears that he has invented a flying car – or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from around the world, a man has used a large part of his property to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he had made his first successful test flight - he glided on his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device evokes positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Work-fighting measures starting tomorrow will be visible in child day care and social and health care services
The bans on overtime and shift swaps in the public and welfare sectors will be particularly visible in social and health care services and day care for children,” says JHL’s Chair Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be reflected in the way that there is not enough staff on site.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
The employer’s task is now to make sure that the services are playing and that no one’s spirit is threatened,” Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift swaps due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility that employees have not been hired, but employees have been overtimed or changed shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
It is a norm in occupational safety and health that each employee takes care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL’s actions are against the government’s intentions to lighten the dismissal protection of small companies.
Markku Jalonen, Director of Local Government Employers, will not pre-assess the effects of overtime and shift swap bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what is to be done.
The area is so extensive, social and health services and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts may vary greatly from industry to industry, by region and by employer, Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week, among other things, she already gained experience in the corresponding three-day activities of the local and basic nurse union Super and the trade union of the social welfare and health care sector.
Their effects were quite minor.
JHL’s ban on overtime and shift swaps applies to municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial action concerns almost 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The Union has also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the dismissal act continues.
The government should now admit that here we run to the wall and hard.
In Jalonen’s opinion, both the trade union and the government must meet.
It is special here that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is born with children and adults - in the condition of the performance we study ray and seahorse gestures
The Great Coral Reef of the Second Space collective premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built together with the audience from start to finish.
This time, however, a clearer-limited presentation is also being built, which refreshes and crystallises the observations made in the initial exercises.
In theatre play, there is plenty of fairy-tale magic also for children.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
A large coral reef is still not a children’s performance, but a performance made by adults and children in co-operation.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and joint play also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat reminiscent of a satubalette, fitness circuit, and nature-themed infoset, but it is finally tuned around visits in different kinds of non-human conditions.
The Great Coral Reef begins with the introduction of coral and coral reef living organisms and fish trajectory.
The six different fitness circuits teach, among other things, the gestures of a ray and a seahorse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be made in which music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of a coral reef.
In the large coral reef, there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being viewed.
In addition, there are organisms that examine corals.
The eyes and observations pointed in many directions make the performance dense and buzzing with life.
Whether the landscape of a organism, the organism that examines the landscape, the other organism or landscape that examines the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it does not seem difficult at all.
In other spaces, the group strives to practice the boundaries of thinking and action, which it takes to reach when the group consists of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a quiet demonstration will be held at Sitratori for endangered corals.
The destruction of human understanding should not be allowed to harden, even if it could be difficult to comprehend the significance of one’s own sympathy in the face of destructive visions.
Other spaces have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of knowledge, other species and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it will clear up space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that there were no smartphones in my childhood
Modern children and young people are becoming more and more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of intoxicants and sex, because others say they do so.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me that he had had to pick up his fifth-class sister for the weekend from a "boyfriend".
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told about her sex experiences that evening.
I couldn’t imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that intoxicants should not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that modern-day children will be able to live a proper childhood, and they would not have to mature too early due to the group pressure created by friends.
I’m constantly seeing younger girls on Instagram who are wearing makeup on their faces and reveal their clothes.
Snapchat is used to capture and send photos revealing in the evenings.
Girls find it even harder to guess what age they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the forest and playing board games.
I am happy that there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I was able to have a child for many years and didn’t have to think about what others think about me.
Yle: Government officials told state management that the case Airiston Helmi is not related to security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Yle, the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Defence Forces were informing the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
It has been reported to the Finnish government that Airiston Helmi’s investigation is not currently related to security, but to organised crime, says Yle.
Information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (National Coalition Party).
According to Kanerva, this week, the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees to report an ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered financial crime.
They were quite strict that they didn’t speculate that there would be anything else here, Kanerva comments in Yle’s interview.
According to Yle’s data, no evidence has so far been found on the connection to security, but the investigation is only taking place.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed from there, says one of Yle’s interviewees.
A week ago, extensive home searches in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation involves mere economic crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti put together a story that goes through claims both for and against.
Video: A dream goal saved Liverpool's defeated series
Liverpool’s 100% Premier League kick-off came to an end, but it was still more satisfied with the 1-1 draw on Stamford Bridge.
It’s been exactly a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge on Sunday and ran into a 1-0 away win.
At that time, Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And surely Liverpool’s manager Jûrgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger, and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to rule his own field head alone.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a mid-century fine league cup away win from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the bench to solve the match with great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first plotted a triangular game with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho in a small space.
Eventually, the Croatian saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but bombarded the perfect left foot at the bottom of the draw.
Pool brass watcher Alisson was a bit slow to fight and only got his fingertip on the ball.
Klopp was sure to feel the losing position lightly unfair, as almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger was cleaning Mo Salah's control from the finish line.
In the second episode, Chelsea champion Kepa also made a real move.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to the traction of the Sadio Mané and pushed the ball from the bottom of the pole into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson resettled his throwing through Hazard.
The best place for guests came in the 72th minute when James Milner discovered Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the brass star's butt oriented towards Teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' leadership position.
It also didn’t take more than 89 minutes when the replacement man Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 meters.
Sturridge played at his old home stadium, and the attacker bombarded it in honor of an irresistible bet in the upper corner.
Liverpool’s 100% league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it’s still at the top of the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship two points behind the tip.
In the clock shift conversation, the poteros are deep
I remember when a few decades ago a magazine asked different Finnish influencers, which shares the people of Finland.
Juice Leskinen’s answer was the only thing that came to mind: the Nen terminal.
Some have a nen-terminal in their last name and some do not.
After all, distribution lines can be created anywhere, and here was one offer.
In the EU, Finland has achieved the phasing out of the annual clock shift.
Very many agree that clock shifting twice a year has been a problem for fools and has caused a wide variety of problems.
Eventually, this achievement seems at least to be the easiest phase of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest part is now to decide when to finally end up: in the current summer or winter season or in some other time zone.
People can also say their opinions about this on the Otakanta.fi website.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The discussion takes place at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has their words to say.
The defenders of winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on the well-being of people, and the summer time defend with the effect of evening light on people’s outdoor desire and thereby on the well-being.
Both positions have their solid adherents and good arguments.
According to studies, the morning light rhythms a person’s day and gives vitality.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from awakening in the dark, then the light will increase the movement of people outdoors and give better opportunities, for example, for autumn yard work.
The amount of additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated for the hour.
I'd rather take both, but bad enough for our location in the north of the Earth we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers for many too bright anyway.
The typical topic of the discussion is that one’s own vision is driven and the other’s vision is strongly opposed.
The arguments of the opposing party are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn one’s head.
It burns the gunpowder wasted.
The topic is very easy to debate, because the matter does not require a great deal of attention and there is a mutu feeling as justifications.
Similar types of matters are usually disputed in the most severe and equally infertile way.
It’s a shame if the wrong option is selected, but doesn’t it adapt.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels awkward.
Josba fought the ringed away win
Josba’s first guest game in floorball Divar produced a full three series against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki with a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still managed the paint at the beginning of the third installment, but Josba searched for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47 the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning goal.
As both teams held back, decisive minutes were played in the equitable.
Josba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was volcanic anyway when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of his goal creation.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
The next one will be O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
200th anniversary in Eno church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno will be celebrated tomorrow in a somewhat sad atmosphere.
The arson of the church of Kiihtelysvaara a week ago was a shock.
Even the church of Eno was guarded for the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still the place for the celebration.
Although no one would like it, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipal and other unions of the world.
The family fair starts at Eno church today at 10 a.m.
After that, we will move to the parish house at the Karelian table.
The program has all kinds of days both indoors and outdoors.
The church building can be visited by Ari Räsänen, who has retired for 37 years as a parish manager.
The celebration of the birth of the church also marks the end of one era.
The church house, which was built in 1982, has already been decommissioned and will open its doors for the last time today.
Now we are in temporary premises at the former municipal hall,” says the vicar Markku Koistinen.
The parish house destroyed indoor air problems, but the church has been in a healthy place for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from the position of President of Tesla's Board of Directors - Fraud charges agreed for $40 million
Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, and Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, have signed an agreement with the SEC, the US Securities Markets Authority.
The SEC suspected that Musk had committed a security fraud, and Musk was at risk of being excluded from the company he founded.
However, Musk is allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk is forced to leave the position of President of Tesla for three years.
The company has to hire a Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk is also subject to stricter control.
According to the agreement, Tesla must hire two independent managers and further monitor Musk’s communications.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both cost $20 million (approximately €17 million) to reconcile the case.
The purpose of the decision is to prevent new market disturbances and disadvantages for Tesla shareholders," says Director Steven Peikin from the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company’s financing has been secured.
Tvitis briefly increased Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected that Musk had committed a security fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company’s other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced its challenge to the company and Musk.
The SEC said it required Musk to be sentenced to fines and banned from acting under the management of listed companies.
The SEC’s challenge scared investors, and Tesla’s share started to decline strongly.
More than 800 people killed in the Indonesian quake and tsunami
In the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami following it, the number of deaths has risen to at least 832, says the country’s catastrophe agency according to the news agency AFP.
The number of death victims is still believed to increase, as the investigation of destruction is ongoing.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may reach thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami, which came to the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
Tsunami was immediately issued a warning after the quake, which, however, was quickly cancelled.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are at least for the time being Palusa.
The rescue authorities are concerned, for example, about the area of Donggala near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Even now, many people are known to have died.
Help requests for ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to rescue workers in search of victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the disaster area today, urged soldiers to continue rescue work without exhausting day and night.
One of the focus areas of rescue work is the hotel in Palu, which is still believed to have 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the Rescue Department, told us that one person could be excavated at night from the ruins of Roa-Roa Hotel, which was popular among business travellers.
We also heard people’s requests for help,” he said.
According to Syaug, heavy clearing equipment would quickly be needed in the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their lost loved ones.
Help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend’s family members were still missing, one author appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians’ phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublers in the UK
Many British politicians were subjected to harassment when their contact information was leaked due to shortcomings in the application’s encryption.
The disturbances were able to access, among other things, the ministers’ telephone numbers.
This was the application used at the British Conservative Party meeting of the government.
For example, the Minister of the Environment, Nutrition and Rural Affairs Michael Gove and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the application, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians who were on the mobile application of the Conservative Party’s annual meeting.
The audience was able to access the profiles using the politician’s email address, which was easily accessible online.
The person logging in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change for a moment to Boris Johnson’s profile picture for a porn shot and title.
Michael Goven’s profile picture was changed to media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s image.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows login to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
You can then view the contact information of the profile person and, for example, send messages in their name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticised.
The spokesman of the Conservative Party apologized for a data leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Agency (ICO) supports the data leak.
The app was created by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The Labour Party in Opposition criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week, there are a large number of clapping Polish in the audience of The Wall Suomi quiz
Focused viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland.
The US format The Wall quickly spread around the world landed as a Finland version for Nelonen last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
The possibilities of shooting in the Polish studio were exceptional, as the large 12-metre game wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the programme’s studio audience was highlighted on social media, which was bet on the Polish.
On Twitter, there was a discussion on whether perhaps the Polish people sitting in the studio could understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Nelonen’s head of domestic programmes, Unne Sormunen, illuminates the issue for Iltalehti.
He says that there are foreign Finns close to the players, other Finns living in Poland and only Polish spectators in the studio audience.
The audience consists of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of the The Wall episodes depicted in the same production space in other countries.
There are also such groups in Finland, so-called professional audiences who visit different program descriptions, Sormunen explains.
He points out that following the game itself is not that difficult even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling off the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters present in the studio for foreign speakers who take care of the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret events all the time as simultaneous interpreting for the studio instructor.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of flap to throw there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with David Hasselhoff’s recent operations in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago involved in Talent Finnish photography in Finland.
All the time, he had a simultaneous interpretation in the ear and he knew everything that was spoken in the descriptions in Finnish, Sormunen sums up.
Shattered typhoon from the southern parts of Japan moves towards the main islands - authorities warn of landslides and floods
The authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the Tram, but according to the authorities, large injuries have been avoided and there is no knowledge of death victims for the time being.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK Finnish Broadcasting Company, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off from more than 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are in some places at a standstill due to a storm.
The storm is expected to hit Osaka at half-day times in Finland.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there will also be strong winds and rains.
Trains have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to the weather scientists, Trami is tormenting Japan until Monday.
The sky of aces gloomed even more
The early days of the aces have been bad.
The sky was almost dark black when the team lost to Vaasa Sport on Saturday 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
There are now five consecutive losses in Pori, and there are two points from six rounds in total.
No Ace Defender or two lower chain players have scored yet.
Pressures are also increasing all the time.
There was almost half of the game left against the audience from the hall.
Six games are only played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we have to be worried because we played that much weakly.
In particular, the performance of the second instalment was disgracedly poor, Jarno Kärki, who had power 1+2 for Äss, said.
For the sport, the victory naturally tasted.
The team had the game below from Friday, so it would have thought it would be visible to do.
Perhaps it was visible, but the Aces could not take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to grow
Pirkko Hyvärinen, the mother of the bread day, marvels at the audience of the event in the grand hall.
Somehow it was thought that this year maybe not so many people would come, Hyvärinen thinks in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Tractor Pen Championships were held simultaneously with the Bread Day, so perhaps it would be expected that the number of audiences could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, the corridors were already briskly blocked before ten, the sellers reported that the products were out of stock, that the news porridge was sold more than 500 portions and that Hyvärinen heard that there was an increase in the number of cars.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
In the five hours of morning and afternoon there was a particularly large programme for families with children, which seemed to attract them a lot of records.
In addition, Hyvärinen expects the event to reach even further away.
Salespeople also curve to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred presenters, artisans, pastries and harvesting products had arrived at the bakery.
The mother of the bread day, PIrkko Hyvärinen, admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children’s series, Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
11 different forms of bread arrived at the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent a day at the marts’ pie workshop.
7 x The most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right mood for the interior and read the book without tiring your eyes.
It is worth investing in good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Innolux’s Sales and Marketing Director.
Do the service for your eyes
The importance of lighting increases, the more years of age are behind it.
Sufficient light can help with problems that many come with age, as the accuracy of vision decreases and glare suffers more and more.
As parents, the need for light also increases.
A person in his or her sixties needs three times more light than a person in his or her twenties.
Therefore, it is worth investing in the therapeutic effects of light and the properties of the lamp already for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
Beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can afford to choose.
The popularity includes a japandi style that combines uncluttered Scandinavianism and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 70s with its strong colours, different metallic tones or ice cream colours has also become a boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in other interiors of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express your personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in the home than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, we want a custom-made, bold luminaire that has a story to tell.
People are clearly searching for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let’s be very design-conscious,” Jokiniemi says.
A timeless classic, which has been saved for many years, may not be the latest trend light for the home.
Some kind of timeless, jewelry-like and elegant classics have their surface year after year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and see!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian forward after three games
Koo Koo and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are separated.
The Canadian forward played a total of three League matches in orange black without power points,” KooKoo says in his press release.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played at KHL in the ranks of Kunlund Red Star and at the KHL farm in KRS Heilongjiang.
There is no information about O'Donnell's new club yet.
The player wants to show an example in recycling - the goods leave the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
In addition to the games nowadays, the Gameman also recycles packaging materials.
The products of the brick-and-mortar store customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged in packages received from importers, for example.
All packages that come to us will be reused.
We may use boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in such a condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula from Oulun Pelimies.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we intend to switch to recycled material even in envelopes.
The movement wants to show an example to others as well.
According to Puurula, recycling does not cause extra effort.
There is no big problem to start recycling.
It will also save money when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for the operations of the Player, as in addition to new products, the central product range of the shop includes, among other things, the games and equipment used.
Purchasing every fashion-conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothing works from season to season in any outfit.
With their versatility, they create a good foundation for garderob, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics, even at low prices.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes a black polo.
Black jumper made of natural material with polo collars can not have an error purchase.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, a tulle skirt and jeans, and can be combined with a discreet outfit as well as a boisterous look.
The poloneule is suitable for both the youthful modern dresser and the classically sophisticated styler.
This is how you create a style.
This autumn’s trendy look is made of gold-brown and wide-leg corduroy trousers, black polo knit and grey ankle boots.
The classic polo knit together with other classics, a blue-green plinth skirt and burgundy loafers form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring the edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casual trendy pieces of clothing: a denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Youthful and stylish!
The sabotage operations of Russian intelligence services have a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation’s foreign intelligence (SVR) or military intelligence (GRU) would have given up this approach.
During the Soviet period, sabotage activities were specialized in so-called DRG groups.
The name comes from the Russian words diverseno-razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of the Soviet Security Service (KGB) in the West have prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites,” says Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004), the archivist who has defected to the West of KGB.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for cover operations for the DRG groups of Bundeswehr, railways, gamekeepers and road workers.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, established inspection stations from the peninsula to the roads leading to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
During the Cold War, agents hid in the terrain for sabotage groups items containing mines, explosives, lighters and media.
In 1998, there was a KGB cache in Switzerland, the trapped trap that exploded when the authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police reached four drunkards in the province at night
The police caught four drunkards in different parts of North Karelia between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old Kontiolahti man blew 1.57 per mil.
At night, he drove two passengers at the beginning of Kajaanintie.
On Polvijärvi’s Kuorevaarantie road, the car fell into the ditch at four nights, and a 19-year-old local man in the car blew 1.54 per mil according to the police.
He did not get serious injuries when he was outgoing.
A 20-year-old outdoor man driving a passenger car in the center of Outokumpu blew 1.33 per mil.
The police suspect that these drivers are intoxicated from driving while driving and in addition to the driver from Polvijärvi, also risking traffic safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man driving a local van at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie blew 0.52 per mil.
He is suspected of driving while intoxicated.
The police will ask for observations of stabbing after midnight at the Turku railway station.
According to the police, the man was abused at the parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
The action was recorded on a surveillance camera.
Dark-haired suspects dressed in dark pants and brown or beige coats immediately left Ratapihankatu in the direction of the bus station after stabbing.
One suspect left Humalistonkatu on a bicycle in the direction of the city centre.
Pedestrian died when he was under the bus in Pori
In Pori, the pedestrian died early on Saturday morning after the bus crashed into him.
After four in the morning, an accident occurred at Niittyuma in Raumantie.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
The police investigate events that led to an accident.
HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the rest of the period, Lehtinen’s probation period ended
Mika Toivola, Director of Sports at HPK Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important to the team in their start-ups, sub-power gaming and the defending role of the fourth field.
During the trial period, Filip Riska, who played in early autumn, will continue at HPK Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of Experienced Risk, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in starting, underpowering and defending the fourth field.
Even though there is still room for improvement, it is good for a young team to hold on to such an experienced player, comments HPK’s sports director Mika Toivola in the club’s press release.
According to Toivola, the value of the risk rises when the hockey league’s solution games are played.
A central striker from Pietarsaari, Finland, Riska has played league hockey earlier in JYP, Lukko and Sport.
Instead, Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the probationary period.
Real story today on TV: Climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man’s own experiences.
The film of the evening is made on the basis of them.
Everest is now premiering on TV in Finland.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised the climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri’s guidance for 2015 tells the story of the survival struggle, which has been treated grainily.
Tragedy has been made into movies - and documents - even before.
Real events are also discussed in this article.
The highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who worked as a Weathers guide.
The spirit of weathers could save the eye surgery carried out before leaving Nepal.
As a result of this and the air pressure, he lost sight, which was why the summit had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued his journey and no longer returned.
However, the struggle of weathers for life and death had just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and found no more in the camp.
When a man was sought, he was found in such bad condition that he was not entrusted with survival.
Weathers were left to die.
As if in a miracle, however, he got on his feet and found the others.
The miserable Weathers were still thought to do death, and once again he was left to his own happiness.
Obviously, contrary to other expectations Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, co-climbers also began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In Beck Weathers, Josh Brolin is portrayed.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated today
Eno’s 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a celebration for the whole family was prepared for the celebration of the centenary year.
The celebrations began at 10 a.m. at the family fair on Eno’s church hill, after which there has been a Karelian buffet at Eno’s parish house.
The church was full.
The family fair was attended by 517 people.
Eno's churchman Armi Rautavuori was glad that people had come to the church so much.
It is a great pleasure for a long time and gives strength to work, Rautavuori (pictured) says.
The firing of the Church of Acceleration has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Church.
The Church of Eno is now the oldest church in the Evangelical Lutheran parishes of Joensuu after the destruction of the Church of Kiihtelysvaara.
The wooden church of Kiihtelysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotion was held in the danger of escalation, where a church destroyed in the fire was quieted and remembered.
Photos and videos: The Medican flashed his power in Greece - Sea disappeared and the street became a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm sprang from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Images taken from the area show plenty of floods throughout Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how between the houses in the town of Kiato in the Korinthia region has suddenly appeared instead of the street due to river floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by flood waters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused strong seafaring.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The Embassy urges you to follow the weather reports and local authorities’ instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or the medican, brings heavy rains and even flood hazards.
According to a study published in 2011 by CNN, only once or twice a year in the world, typically around September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The now-blowing storm left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing north and towards Europe.
Concern in Greece has also caused refugee camps on islands, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper shelter.
In the summer, areas destroyed by wildfires in the surroundings of Athens will also remain under the storm.
In Greece, the mechanic also ravaged last November.
Don't go to the sea now, flights still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday in the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Excursions to the sea are cancelled, and when walking, it is advisable to be careful that no branches or other bulk items will fly on top of the storm.
Such instructions have been shared by the guides over 3 500 people who spend the weekend holidaying in Greece through Aurinkomatkat.
The instructions will come in handy, as even the hurricane Zorbas storm is predicted to strike the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speed can rise up to 45 meters per second in gust.
Heavy rains add to the roar of the weather.
All passengers travelling to and from Finland via Sun Trip and Tui who have reported their phone number have been warned by tourists of strong winds via SMS.
Still in the air the sun and the heat
According to Inka Ikonen, a specialist in solar communications, the worst has been avoided by the beginning of Saturday at the resorts.
For example, flights have landed and increased according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we keep an eye on the situation all the time.
Safety ahead is being taken.
Antonia Schroderus, a media helpline at Tui, says that their flights have also gone on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff at the property.
At least in Crete was still calm, he told us on Saturday in the early evening.
Tuilla currently has a total of over 1 500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, i.e. Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos will reach on Sunday in the morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon in Rhodes, the sun had risen and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees, says Ikonen of Aurinkomatkat.
Zorbas has been estimated to become the next Turkish nuisance, albeit with a slight relief.
We have been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya with Tuilla,” Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Hussilla completely identical evening dresses in the final - this is how they react to the situation
The media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Suomi final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says she has bought a dress from Meslew.
I went to the shop and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great suit for this evening, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress was also chosen by host Shirly Karvinen.
The two also noticed their outfits and laughed at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to put himself on board the plane.
Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet host in the final, and he talks about the front row stars coming to the scene.
Hus has a fresh move behind him, as he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
Now I’m going to stay there for now, let’s see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi ponders.
Before moving, Hussi spent his vacation alone in Greece.
It was lovely, I was just a week in a hotel without going anywhere.
When stress broke out, I got a cold, but otherwise my holiday was really successful,” Hussi says.
The behaviour of Shirly Karvinen in the airplane attracted a lot of attention - gathered curious looks of pensioners
The presenter and the 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen said that she had enough to do with the radio and Love Island Suomi photoshoots on the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final.
Even to the extent that Karvinen arrived to the finals directly from Finnair’s flight, there has been enough rush.
I applied makeup and put the hair on the machine.
This is that glamour.
Changing the evening dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says that he has pulled out his make-up in the middle of pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and saw people’s eyes in the mirror.
My make-up was amusing at least in the opinion of others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his visit to Love Island as a host of Finland.
He also describes his experience as stopping so far.
Karvinen says he’s been saying he’s been doing some singles in the program on Friday.
It’s really raw in some way.
They are real human emotions, Karvinen describes the feelings of singles in the program.
How do I wear over-the-knee boots?
Three perfect example costumes
Classic clothes are pieces of clothing that work from season to season in any outfit.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes even the most modern ones can be included.
A few years ago, over-the-knee boots, which have become the hit shoes of the autumn and winter season, have not gone anywhere.
As the name suggests, over-the-knee boots are repeated in style year after year and from season to season.
Spectacular boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model worth trying, well - boldly.
Over-the-knee boots really fit into any outfit.
Whether it’s jeans, lace, tulle or tricot, the boots’ simple leather or faux leather surface works.
Long boots look great both in the festive look and everyday outfits.
Black over-the-knee boots are well suited for even the most delicate outfits.
They perfectly balance the femininity of a pink, floral pleated skirt and a soft, chunky knit.
Fresh yet stylish everyday outfit for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro outfit is created by a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-generation boots, eye-catching earrings and a rivet little bag.
While over-the-knee boots have a certain level of sophistication, they are also perfect for casual wear along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars start to operate in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, the City of Espoo informs.
The robot cars in Otaniemi will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area is scheduled to start traffic by a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical functionality of vehicles in Finland’s conditions.
The experiment shows how robotic cars can cope with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real-world environment, says traffic manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic cars will be fully automatically transported to other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The passenger on board is always responsible for the safety of the vehicles.
The vehicles constantly sense their surroundings with several different sensors and assess whether the driving path is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake is detected, says Harri Santamala, Managing Director of Sensible 4, which is responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars run all autumn three days a week: Tuesdays at 13-15.30, Wednesdays at 10-15 and Thursdays at 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
The stops of the robot cars are identified by the stop markings.
The most likely way to get a ride is from the stop number 1 on Otakaari.
Mokoma's bassist dropped from stage in the middle of a gig and was injured
The band Mokoma informs about the surprising situation on their Facebook pages at the Pakkahuone gig in Tampere.
The band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen dropped from the stage in the middle of the performance.

Fans of Mokoma are concerned about the photo update, where bassist Santtu lies in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was pretty hard to see how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones will get better over time.
For Santu and a good continuation of the tour to the rest of the band plus a fugitive!
And thanks for yesterday, the great gig was, but you promise to leave such a strong drama away from the end of the gigs in the future?
Police oversee hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department performed hunting supervision on Friday and Saturday with the Finnish Wildlife Agency in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department’s wilderness contact persons told on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was on the legality and licensing of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected with a hunting card and a hunting permit required for state-owned lands.
In addition, the possession permits for hunting weapons and the permitted number of cartridges for self-charging weapons used in chicken breeding were inspected.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was met in connection with the surveillance, who lacked the required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered to receive 12 daily fines for unauthorised hunting.
In addition, the police blown 133 drivers of the vehicle, and two of them are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fine procedure, police times.
To sum up, hunters follow the permitting of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter stated that "I have been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checks permissions".
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting supervision in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen leaves for Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (National Coalition Party) will travel to Turkey on the next few days to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
530 Syrian refugees from refugee camps in Turkey have been decided to go to Finland this year.
The selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, and representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police are involved.
The delegation is already in Turkey to conduct interviews.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) first selects people in a particularly vulnerable position for the candidate.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly distressed in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected in the group of people coming to Finland than there is in the quota, as in practice, part of the population will not arrive for different reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet civil society organisations operating on the border between the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Süleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also involved in the journey.
Speaking of raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was for a couple of years in 1 050 years, but the government has since not agreed to lift it.
The National Coalition Party has supported the raising of quotas, but the project has last fallen into the resistance of blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently proposed gradually raising the quota to 1 500-2 000 people a year.
Mykkänen’s visit is the first one that the Minister of the Interior will make on site during this term of government to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Ministers of the Interior Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) and Paula Risikko (National Coalition Party) had time to move on to their new duties before the visits were organised.
Finland receives a subsidy of EUR 10 000 from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the hacks - no longer knows if to cry or laugh
Karjalainen reported last Saturday on the draft law to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
From the article, it was understood that the legislative proposal, in principle, prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by the decrees of the ministries, as production animals, pets or otherwise related to business activities.
In other words, all other animals, except those specified in the Regulation, are, in principle, prohibited.
If the bill becomes a law, it means that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security of society or good practice.
As a rule, we are now enacting a ban on all activities to which the law or regulation does not expressly authorise.
The change causes that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else done before the law or regulation that approves it has been issued.
In general, the Government’s work in legislative drafting has been weak.
If we start on the road that basically everything in Finland is forbidden, which is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or to laugh.
I do not suspect that the Animal Welfare Act would not require an update.
But this kind of legal project is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but it may accept such a "all is prohibited, which is not allowed by law or regulation separately" procedure.
I hope there will be some sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a law project.

Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes’ superiority compared to Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was awarded that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece of Russian gp in time.
However, there is no reason to sink into panic at the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than we were, but no huge thing is all about.
Our car was the best in time all the weekend until now, but they were just too fast, fourth driven and with their teammate Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen, who was clearly on Mercedes speed, said.
Ferrari already struggled in the previous race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what the sudden drop of Mercedes was due to.
They seem to go faster than we - so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we would probably go at the same rate as they.
But I don’t know more than anyone else.
This is always guessing, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, we saw a rare treat for Sauber in the future stable of Räikkönen.
Charles Leclerc was the seventh to replace Räikkönen on Ferrari next season, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final qualifying session.
For the Swedish driver, the 10th place of departure is the best for more than three years.
And although in the second driving session as many as five drivers did not drive completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And maybe encouraging to Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare to where they were from the beginning, then the step ahead has been big.
Next year there will be a different story, so let's see, let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkkan Teper’s match in Stuttgart’s evening proceeded on a steady basis.
German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he did not get a good match.
Clearly more far-reaching, Helenius controls the match with his tough sets that found well to reach.
Finnish was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth installment when Helenius knocked out Teper on the left.
The hit was so hard that the veteran in front of the home crowd did not even try to get up from the carpet.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
In a ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponents.
Then he switched to a Finnish language for a moment.
Thank you to all spectators and Finnish encouragers.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was delighted immediately after the match.
This was a really big victory for Helenius’ career.
It would perhaps be an opportunity to even get to the World Cup, Helenius commented on Iltalehti before the match.
Instead, the loss might have ended the whole boxing career.
Of course, it has been in the mind.
This is no longer a younger one, Helenius 34 years old admitted before the Teper meeting.
The number of victims of disaster in Indonesia may multiply
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country is urging to prepare for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to the country’s vice president Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can reach thousands.
Severe conditions
Rescuers are looking for trapped and dead in the worst-cased areas of Sulawesi Island: the port city of Palu and its neighboring city Dongala.
So far, all victims are from Palusa, there is no clarity about the situation in Donggala yet.
Hundreds of people are lost and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people in collapsed buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out of.
For example, a hotel in Palu called Roa has collapsed.
The rescuers report having heard the cries of people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered military rescue and clearing work.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as electricity and data connections are crossed in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also depleting.
Miss Suomi finalist’s hesitant answer and long reflection caused a laughter
New Miss Finland is currently being selected in Billnäs Ruukki.
In the interview round, a question was asked to each miss finalist.
The finalists drew the question of the glass bowl on stage.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, the hesitational answer was given to a sweet but good-natured laughter in the audience on the spot.
The question asked about Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book the miss finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good time before he hesitated.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The latest book I have read is..., Anttikoski said, wondering.
The public was given a reflection break until Anttikoski continued to reply:
The last book I've read is...
I have read books at school!
Certainly something related to economics.
So the last book I have read has someone in economics, Anttikoski replied.
After answering, Anttikoski received the applause from the audience accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the missi tour, Anttikoski attracted attention, as he did not want to pose in underwear due to his principle.
Miss Finland in 2018 will be crowned at 21.00 when Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm of last year renounces the crown.
Sike's apple-pear cake takes the language by its way
This recipe is for you who have good, acidic apples from your own back, as the domestic apple in the shop is shockingly priced.
A pear may need to be bought, although quite a few people already have the pear tree to grow.
This cake can also only be made from apples if you do not want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more varied if you also put a pear on the cake.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seeds.
Slice.
Melt the butter in a saucepan.
Beat the eggs and sugar until foamy, then add the corn flour and melted butter to the foam.
Combine corn starch, or maizena, with baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread tin with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough over the pear slices and the apple wedges over the dough.
Spoon the dough over the apple wedges.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Allow to cool in the pan and then undo the serving dish.
Cut the cake only properly cooled.
The cake is brittle in construction and crumbles easily because the dough has almond and corn flour without gluten.

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admiration?
The researchers at the University of Sydney, who analysed the matter, have outlined two species of "coolity" consisting of slightly different features: generally charming coolness and contrasting dissident-coolness.
Attractively cool people, according to the researchers, had many characteristics considered desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, suitable and qualified.
The dissidents, on the other hand, had a typical distance, independence, rebelliousness and edge.
They thirsted for experience and only took care of the outside reviews.
Both types were united by good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of hardness is not longer cool: a high status in adolescence may not lead to success later in life.
This is what the American study published in Child Development in 2014.
Young people who socialised early, partyed, sought out good-looking groups and sought the popularity of others, as young adults, had an increased risk of using intoxicants and falling into crimes.
In their relationships, they were less successful than inconspicuous peers.
Locks, branded bags or watches that communicate a high status do not make a person cool - or at least truly attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most people were more willing to make friends with their regular market shirts than with those dressed in a branded shirt - despite the fact that most of them chose a brand shirt in an acquaintance.
If you are on the Greek Holiday Islands, beware!
It's hit by a hurricane - weather warning screaming red
During the weekend in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland on average during six months.
The Zorbas storm hits Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the area of Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca’s blog.
According to it, the hardest gusts of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm, which was beaten in the beginning of the week, blew at its best about 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but heavy rains.
Over 300 millimetres of water can come in southern Greece during the weekend.
It corresponds to about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the development of a storm on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, the Zorbas storm has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize the Love Island Finland Duck drooled by men?
Appears in confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that the beauty Anku, drooled by many men in the Love Island Finland series, also performs as a craft aunt with strange YouTube videos released in 2010.
With the videos, Anku advises craftsmen to manufacture octopus from the old kitchen paper roll, among other things.

Valtteri Bottas shook and bursted with adrenaline in Sochi - will he become Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas trembled a little further tens of minutes after his pole position on the Russian gp when he was in front of the media.
The fine tour left behind Mercedes’s first star Lewis Hamilton and was probably an important criticism even for the Finnish time this season.
Nice tour.
I don’t know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution round in the middle.
It feels good, I still shake it a little bit, Bottas explained.
I have only been on the pile once this year, in Austria (in midsummer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before and I got some good rounds again.
The Sochi track is not easy to skip, so the departure plays a particularly big role.
And, of course, Bottas was able to respond to the curiosity whether he will drive tomorrow for victory or whether he is facing a Hamilton approaching the title of World Cup.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I try to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the pile, Bottas piled up.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis’s management to Sebastian Vettel is quite big and the difference to me very big, so it keeps in mind.
Let's see what happens, however, Bottas completed.
Hamilton was genuinely happy about the success of Bottas after the ride, and the Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff also tasted.
Lewis was about to win Valtteri, but he wasn’t successful in a standstill.
Valtteri knows that he has to tear everything about himself in order to win Lewis.
And he had so charged that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff annealed.
The question of whether the stable would allow Bottas and Hamilton to run honestly, Wolff answered dodging.
We will discuss in the morning and see how the race will leave.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee reached the Finnish Rally Championship
Rally racing SM-series ended rarely.
Never before have the brothers become masters of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done by the Tuusula residents Erik and Henrik Peterinen in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Erik won SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee ensured the best achievement in his career when the third place of the final race sealed him in the SM4 category of two-wheeled cars from the Finnish championship.
Kinnunen, who competes in Honda Civic, and Ville Mäkelä, the co-driver, started with the temptation of the Turku competition, because the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday evening, the duo had to give a handicap when some of the extra lights were betrayed by another special experiment.
In it, it was possible to find a third piece of time blind.
In such a situation, it is not suitable for nonsense.
On Saturday, only Jussi Teppo, who had been second in the series, was watched, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands the United States, France and Turkey to pull their troops away
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops in Syria are fighting terrorism, and war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his UN address, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their home country.
However, there is no end to the seven-year war.
More than 360 000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a Syrian meeting is planned for October, in addition to her participation in the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the judge drama of the highest court on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received an exceptionally large number of people.
In the United States, the title drama of the Supreme Judge received at least 20 million people to his TVs on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Californian professor Blasey Ford, accusing him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee to tell his story.
According to preliminary results, six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC, and NBC, followed a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to them, several million more online hearings were followed.
The NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that it had made its record for the year with 8.2 million live streams launched.
The number of CNNs increases by more than 10 million, including those who have followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also started 8.0 million times.
Digital start-ups are channel-specific, TV viewer numbers come from Nielsen, a research and data analysis company.
Nielsen publishes the final figures on Monday, but they are in any case dizzy.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers are only able to access sports matches, as well as major Oscars and Grammy galas in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches, and in 2016 presidential debates.
Of course, it’s a trip to the Super Bowl, the most viewed annual program in the USA, the final of the National Football League NFL.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered some 103 million people to the NBC channel.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump’s first speech to the Congress looked at nearly 48 million people and over 30 million people in attendance.
A top-notch thing
In the U.S., the appointment of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case, since the positions are life-long.
Trump was able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent then President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was in several questions a so-called landscape language whose voice could determine the position of the nine-person court.
He was a supporter of abortion and sexual minorities’ rights, and in 2015, for example, decided in his voice that same-sex people were entitled to marriage in the whole federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in terms.
His choice to the Supreme Court may be enshrined by the Supreme Court for decades.
Children have the right to receive their information to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see the health data of their children in the Kanta service.
It’s a big problem, it’s wrong and it’s weird.
Of course, the situation in the Kanta service was even more worrying: the parents were unable to see even the baby’s health data or recipes.
In autumn 2016, a temporary correction was made to the situation for minors under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazing long time to repair.
Now the repair is coming - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a shoutout.
After that, the layman’s understanding is about pushing a button: now that the pipe is held, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his/her information to parents - if he/she has a bank ID or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
The ID card is subject to a fee, and a 10-year-old is not even allowed.
In practice, no one can see the data of the primary school’s four-grader except by requesting it printed.
It is not so much a parent’s right as a child’s right.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that the parents can be involved in it.
Of course, teenagers’ right to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors may have family situations in which not all things can be freely spoken.
Often they are related to sexual health, which is deeply human rights in free care.
In the U.S., the FBI commences rescuing harassment accusations about Kavanaugh
According to American media, the FBI investigates harassment accusations by at least two women.
One of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate’s Justice Committee.
Kavanaugh has disputed the accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
President Donald Trump of the United States ordered the FBI to investigate the accusations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The report must not last longer than one week.
According to Washington Post, it is a criminal investigation on a more limited basis, and it may not become public.
Man threatened to kill police officers at a police station in Kajaani
The captured rattler continued to bulge even in the chamber.
The police report that they have put a man in a police prison to " calm down".
The police were threatened by a suspected assaulter on the night against Saturday in Kajaani.
The Office informs about a case that originated when a fair 30-year-old man challenged a fierce dispute in a central restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client inside the nutritionist.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
Outside the fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When a third party tried to intervene, the man still struck him.
Triple assault led to the police calling.
The scout caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, the police report.
The suspect still behaved aggressively at the police station.
The man kicked another policeman on his foot.
He threatened to kill and abuse the police.
The police say that they have transited a man to police prison to "soothe".
The man is suspected of three assaults and the violent opposition of the official.
Grant organisations prepare to start work at Indonesian Sulawesi - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UN Children’s Association Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” says Kirsi Haru, Communications Manager at Unicef Finland.
Local authorities lead rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already obvious at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task is to find people in the ruins, both survivors and the dead.
In the city of Pala, Sulawesi, rescue operations are under way, but in the Donggala area, slightly norther, the situation is more unclear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Grant measures are difficult because the roads are also crossed, says Haru.
The buildings are often lightweight in Sulawesi, so the destruction caused by earthquakes and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter - at first, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
The first thing that can often be offered to people is water purification tablets, which are also in stock at Unicef.
The aim is to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in case of emergency, water is transported to a primary emergency, for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
Finding family members and bringing together families is one part of the mission of Unicef.
Food aid, on the other hand, is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the early stages, previously collected funds will be used for emergency assistance.
However, Unicef has already started fundraising to help victims of Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk Stops Tesla's Board Chair - $20 Million fines on Tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of companies manufacturing space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges by agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk resigns as Chairman of the Board of Tesla, and agrees to a fine of $20 million.
Musk withdraws from the position as part of a contract which he entered into with the U.S. Securities Markets Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing to Musk avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Musk because of his tweets in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he is preparing for the withdrawal of the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which led to a rapid increase in the company’s share price.
According to the agreement, Musk may not act as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its Board of Directors and appoint two "independent directors" to its Board of Directors.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk’s personal fines of $20 million, the Tesla company also has to pay the corresponding fines of 20 million to the financial controller.
Tweets led investors astray
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
According to billionaire tweets, the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange at a stock price of $420.
Tesla’s share price increased by more than ten per cent per day after tweets, but declined later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s claims did not have any basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not really negotiated the funding he had claimed.
He had also not discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with other members of the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors of the company.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate dropped by 14 per cent when the security officer SEC reported fraud charges.
The agreement on the news is expected to strengthen the company’s course again.
Last judgment is not a reason
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands do not move.
This is a technical problem.
The clock of the Helsinki Cathedral tower has stopped.
The hands indicate at twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: still when the church’s crypt would be manuscript and the organ would ring to itself.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped because of the technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some part has broken and is expected to be a new part of it, says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account states that the last judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says that the clocks in the church do not ring due to the fault.
