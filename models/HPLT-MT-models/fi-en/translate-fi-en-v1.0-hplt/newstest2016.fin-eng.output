A 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere was found
The police have had a search task due to a 9-year-old boy’s escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The loss report concerning a boy who has started moving from Western Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and he has no danger to life and health.
The son’s father told Ilta-Sanomat that he was found at midnight.
He is fine and now we start the ex post-examination.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, father said.
Ronaldo again wildly - tore the goal difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league during the weekend and continued his factory in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo on the Champions League goal kingship turned for at least a moment to the benefit of the latter.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved alone to the top of the all-time goal scorer statistics as he shot a visitor to Shahtar Donetsk’s network two hits for penalty kicks and one of the game situations.
Ronaldo raised his goals balance to 80 when before Tuesday, Barcelona Messi, who had been compiling with him, had 77 matches.
Real won the match 4-0
Juventus has robbed in the Italian football league Serie A in the beginning of the season, but in the Champions League Group D, it began with a strong 2-1 away win from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored more than ten minutes before the end of Juventus’ Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of Sergei Aguero, who was kneeling.
In the Premier League game of the weekend, the injured Aguero entered the field only at the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also experienced a hard PSV Endhoven defeat in the Netherlands after a 1-2 defeat.
ManU’s 20-year-old side defender Luke Shaw’s guest match lasts only a quarter of an hour.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking cladding hit the goal-attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw was likely to break the shinbone.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven’s home stadium a dozen minutes before the medical staff went to carry him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to the 1-0 in 41st minute, but the pleasure of ManU lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno smoothed before the break with an additional time.
PSV's win goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
In the Champions League of the season, the group A started in Paris Saint-Germain.
This was the case of Angel Di Maria, an Argentineer who had switched to the PSG jacket from Manchester United.
Di Maria broke through from the right and took over Malmö’s goalie Johan Wiland to the back of the ball.
Edinson Cavani made a second half for PSG 2-0.
PSG has been predicted among the season’s successes.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league’s small clubs, is not the best possible comparison.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional career as the starting club of Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team Moscow TsSKA lost their group B in a match to Wolfsburg 0-1 in Germany.
Opposition Party called for immediate separation - the President held the wrong speech
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has again given the same speech in the country’s parliament, which he held at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full force of spirit.
The main opposition party MDC demanded that Mugabe resign from his mission, as this is too old to manage.
The assistants of Mugabe rushed to say that the confusion had occurred only in the Mugabe staff and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit for EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, will assess the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, heads of state should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register for Europe more effectively.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are at the table of the Ministers of the Interior.
Teacher admits that he has shot his girlfriend during an emergency call
The voice only slightly colored university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that she shot her girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his “golden dog” is alive and probably upset, and said that the contact details of the close relatives of the deceased woman can be found on his phone.
Inside the house, the police found a handwritten message on the side of Amy Prentiss’ body and the enemy: “I am so sorry I could cancel this one I loved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me,” was said in a letter signed by the experts.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled almost 500 kilometres to the school campus, where the police believe that he had shot and killed a teacher of history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study.
Lynn Buford, Chief of Police at Delta State University, told the university staff that they had heard about shooting at 10.18.
He said that Lamb had made a fatal emergency call for some time after.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one: Lamb committed suicide while the police were besieging him.
The authorities still tried to find out Lamb’s motive for the day after the students and staff had had to hide behind locked doors due to school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, however, who may have had problems.
The students said they had been waiting for his classes.
The police of the city of Prentiss, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal register.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the “great people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended both male courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
The student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, “as if something had been wrong.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had said that he had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously requested a sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the salary principles of the university meant that even though Lamb had worked hard to promote his doctoral value, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
William LaForge, Rector of the University, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt in his knowledge, but that “clearly there was something in Lamb’s mind.”
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After Lamb had escaped from the campus, he was left by the police when he moved back from Arkansas state in Mississippi.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself in a .38-calibre pistol in the backyard of a house about one and a half kilometers south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi," said Methel Johnson, the cause of death of Washington County.
Lamb’s car was still running on the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb just went to this house, though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education, with 3500 students and located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb received a doctoral degree in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said he was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old when they met through shared friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who for many years tried to teach Hairston to play the guitar.
He was quite a charm in those times.
All the girls were molten wax when he was there, now said 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburb Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss apparently had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he had killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told the dog that it was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O’Steen, told them that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, now having a 19-year-old daughter.
He’s really upset,” O’Steen described her daughter.
He was the best friend of his mother.
O’Steen said he hadn’t met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentissi when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later they played together at some gigs.
O’Steen told her that her daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at The Julep Room near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentis on the night against September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
”Just a happy couple,” he said.
We fooled and tossed the tramps at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first-year student seminar program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, told the school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He studied at the Kansas Emporia State University and was chairman of his brotherhood and student board.
On Tuesday evening in Cleveland, Delta State campus, a candlestick devotion was held, involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the show, during which the University choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
We are trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report on Mississippi’s Cleveland.
Associated Press author Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been fixed according to the fact that the police now say that Lamb had made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not employ as many employees for the holiday season as last year, but the retailer of toy and baby products says that the current permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in stores and distribution centres across the country, with 45 000 hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the interviews with the applicants will start this month, and the number of personnel will increase from October to December.
Although there are months of holidays, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores and the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox fucks for his “date” with Princess Diana
The premiere of the movie Back to the Future was a tremendous moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
We sat in the theatre waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that I was sitting next to me, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to me,” he said in the back-time trailer of the upcoming documentary film Back in Time.
The film begins and it comes to my mind that I am just an artificial yawn and a hand stretching away from a date with a princess from Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future, interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and production director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future was premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “For me, it’s undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie ever.”
Back in Time is available as an on-demand video, DVD, and some cinemas in October.
UN Director says Syrian situation is not resolved armedly
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict is “not resolved armedly”, and the additional weapons only worsen violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director once again urged all parties, including the demerged UN Security Council, to merge and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he intends to meet the five permanent ministers of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France in connection with the Ministerial Week of the Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces ‘ has made the situation impossible to solve.’
Ban urged five permanent Member States to demonstrate the solidarity and unanimity of the Syrian crisis in the context of the Iranian nuclear programme.
8 support survey results that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to stamp him as a vane.
Others just consider him a joke.
Some are waiting for a crash.
While some Republicans have tried to hug Donald Trump away from the top of the support surveys, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Out of the last 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been lead by a double-digit number, and some have seriously begun to consider what this means for the designation possibilities of the real estate king.
Of course, the parliamentary term is only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that at this point in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his leadership position to the rising Herman Cain, both of which did not gain any state behind them in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noted Trump’s persistence and started using his funds to overthrow him.
The following recent endorsement survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a transient stage:
Trump’s recommendation figures have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, Monmouth University’s support polls showed that only two Republicans out of ten welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In the endorsement survey conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60% of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be satisfied if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they would either be ‘excited’ or ‘satisfied’ if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be “still” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% “inspired” vs. Trump’s 40%).
The next most inspirational?
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be ‘unhappy’ or ‘stunned’ if the rulers’ favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
The fiery nature of Trump is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his grandiose speeches and insults, according to the ABC News/Washington Post survey on Monday, 52% of Republican-side tilting voters at the national level think that the real estate king has the right character for the president.
According to Quinnipiac’s last week’s survey, in the first party meeting in Iowa state, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think that Trump has the right character for the leader.
According to the ABC/Post survey, 44 per cent think that his nature is not suitable for acting as president, and almost six out of ten thinks that his nature is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think that Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated for Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Data disclosure: The voters of the Republican Party have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball at their disposal.
During the last election period, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry was nominated, and only 28 per cent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most Republican voters consider Trump’s campaign to be credible.
Even if the Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump’s leadership, as the support against Trump has been divided among numerous other candidates.
However, the survey conducted by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives the majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul with John Kasichi and Chris with 33 points each.
He is tied to Ted Cruz.
The only Trump's winning candidate?
If they were set against them, Ben Carson would win the businessman Trump with a big difference of 18 points.
Just and just the majority of Donald Trump’s supporters have said that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey from Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump’s profitable voters have decided who their voices will go to.
The situation can naturally change, and no one can say that they would never change their minds.
46 per cent said that they may be able to exchange candidates.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice as likely to be on the Trump side.
Six out of ten Republicans say that Trump agrees with immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants “raisers” in his campaign initiation speech, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s might will drive the Latino voters further away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
The frustration of the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump’s and Ben Carson’s support now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely because of their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in the ABC/Post survey on Monday that they prefer to choose a non-political person than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A two-week Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey from Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans have become frustrated with Republicans at Congress: 54 percent is “unhappy” and 21 percent are “very angry”.
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance with the Prime Minister's Question Hour
Corbyn's first appearance in the survey class has been eagerly expected since his selection
Jeremy Corbyn, the new leader of the Labour Workers’ Party, will meet David Cameron for the first time in the Prime Minister’s Question Hour.
Corbyn rises to ask his first six questions a little after noon, and most likely both the media and the representatives of the working party watched closely on his performance.
Corbyn has demanded “less theatre and more facts” for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the events to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn’s leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Trade Union Central Organisation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the leader of the working party to stand quietly during the national song at the Tuesday Memorial Service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain Air War, has evoked criticism with the members of the conservative party and appeared in several front-page articles.
Corbyn's decision not to sing a national song has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said that he "standed with respect quietly" and that he confesses "The Royal Air Force's bravery in the Great British Air War."
A member of Corbyn's shadow board, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Two's Newsnight program that he would have urged the leader of the Labour Party to sing a national song, despite the fact that he thinks the royal room should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in the Corbyn Insider, claiming disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and he was initially supported by less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that policy differences regarding the party’s position in the European Union and the government’s grant ceiling have ‘heavy’ also within the working party since Corbyn’s appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Trade Union Central Organisation that the Workers’ Party would propose a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Smith stated that the party was ‘very clear’ in that they only objected to the government’s plans to lower the ceiling from £26 000 to £23 0000.
Corbyn becomes the fifth leader of the Workers’ Party, which David Cameron has met during the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has “populated” ideas into questions for the Prime Minister, and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Corbyn, a member of the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister’s Question Hours is too much to counter, and that he intends to refrain from both witty verbalism and spikes, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the Finance Secretary of the shadow government Angela Eagle acts as her substitute in the survey hours when Corbyn does not participate - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues could sometimes be given speeches, and he has said that he has approached the chair of the lower room, John Bercow, on the matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move further away from a political theatre that is often associated with the Prime Minister’s survey hours, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they started televisionizing in 1990, the Prime Minister’s Question Hour has been an important measure in assessing the leader’s discretion, his lower room’s control, and his position with other people’s representatives, although the reviewers have criticised the question hours that they have only become a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Filmed in Joburg: Homeless Young People Trained as Photographers

However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
I was shot in Joburg’ is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

Pound value rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed an increase in the UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The pace of growth was fastest after 2009, and it was considered to bring with it estimates of the increase in the courses.
The pound rose above $1.505, and 0.84% against €1.330.
The FTSE 100 index closed at a rate of 1.49% to read 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share on the market and rose by 20 percent after the competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine two of the world’s largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share increased by 0.9 per cent after a competing luxury product group from Richmond received encouraging news.
Richemont’s latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is the key market for Burberry - had begun to grow again.
Glencore shares rose by 5 percent after the mining giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt cutting strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest reducers of the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation of the company to “sell”.
JD Sports increased by 3.1 per cent after the sportswear company announced its six-month return before taxes: an increase of 83 per cent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports leader says higher wages can damage expansion
President of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the UK, it could mean that “the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase.”
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the company’s higher labor costs,” Cowgill says.
The costs could be related to the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash starts a grassroots campaign for Aldi against penetration
Metcash tries to protect its IGA trades from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Food Wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA merchants in South and Western Australia before Aldi’s $700 million invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores coming in, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food brokers and build the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA’s traders and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as the ice cream maker Simmo’s from Dunsborough offer tastings in IGA’s stores, and store owners sell discounted tickets for Australian football matches to their regulars.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and hardware organizes an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot in the game, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA trades, with margins higher than Metcash’s IGA network in the Eastern states.
In South and Western Australia, visitors are known to be communicative, and IGA retailers have a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take about 5% of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of opening the first movements, from all actors, but mainly from independent retailers.
In its report this week, Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA’s resellers could lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 and 30 stores in the south and west next year, generating net sales of $500 and $600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and volumes at Metcash’s high fixed costs base can cost Metcas about $13 million in operating profit before interest and taxes,” Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in Eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food and food sales will decline by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will decrease from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said with a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could ‘well lose in a decade’.
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass comments.
However, it has been understood that a Metcash board member would have contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has decreased from 18% to 14%, and the revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which provides products to around 1200 IGA retailers, have decreased by 43% since 2012, reflecting a reduction in debt financing for operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler stands out, and has invested more than $150 million each year when calculating the prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers renovate stores by increasing faster fresh food, as well as bringing a better selection of private label products to the market.
Ian Morrice, CEO of Metcash, says that lowering prices and improving stores have increased attraction, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, Chair of the Australian Tennis Association, supports Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in a recent storm that has ravaged around her friend Nick Kyrgios, who rather deserves honor than criticism for his own behaviour, says Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Federation.
A younger member of the talented duo named Special Ks, Kokkinakis was involuntarily exposed to a situation where Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, when Harrison declared: “Wawrinkan should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that brat.”
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking down his racket after the cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been the unwavering defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth in the second place in the double-player Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semi-final against the UK.
”I think that Thanasi has just been pulled in,” Healy said.
He broke his racket when he lost his cramp in the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break his racket in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he’s not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, also in quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a bit harshly.
She is very mature 19 years old, she works hard, fits the team and so on, and she has never had any problems with other players, she is appreciated in the dressing room, she exercises firmly, is in good shape and is quite a calm and mature young man, and I think she should be judged by her merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include in the important games starting in Kyrgyz on Friday, describing this ‘common decision’ as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberran return to the team’s permanent fleet.
We want the team to be fully focused on games and not on all the polemics around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And Nick has risen really quickly as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he’s grown up in public, has made some horrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he’s received, but we’re trying to support him, we’re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it’s best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public thinking about these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern borders against Serbia, arresting those attempting to enter illegally, with the aim of damming the flow of immigrants to the country.
At the border, chaos followed when hundreds of migrants gathered in an unbiased area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with astonishment.
People fleeing the violence of their home countries have now pitched their tents and settled in an unspecified period of time between the two country control stations.
But frustration grew.
While the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants woke up “Open the border!” and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared that it is ‘unacceptable’ to return migrants from Hungary when they arrive all the time more from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, does not cause damage to civilians.
Discussion must take place in the coming days with other countries and Brussels,” said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Mixed oppression on the border between Hungary and Serbia arose after the 28 groups of nationalities failed to create a common immigration policy at a conflicting meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for a person seeking 40 000 asylums who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and hopefully spoke of reaching the final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demand an additional EU summit on Tuesday next week to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will operate in the near future.
Tuesday’s emergency situation in two southern regions allowed the authorities to act in a crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum rights cases can be accelerated.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the border of Serbia is ready, the country will also set up a barbed wire fence on part of its border against Romania to stop the flood of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reports that even the prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and arrival point for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are fleeing from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life and not those fleeing the war, who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly incompatible with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now define as a crime a company to cross or damage a 4-metre (13 feet) barbed wire fence built by the government on a southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human traders.
Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares an emergency,” the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told the journalists of the South in the Szeged city.
We are very clear: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament must still formally accept the stationing of the troops expected next week, but for days the journalists of Associated Press have seen heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs.
Orban’s domestic security advisor Gyorgy Bakondi said that the authorities had arrested 45 people when they tried to cross the border, and 15 people who had already gone further into the country.
They overcame the fence by harming it, are now imprisoned by the police, and are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
The fence is repaired quickly by the authorities.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points on the border against Serbia after sending a barbed carriage to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near Hungary Roszke was covered with chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for human processing and the crowds came to intrud.
About 20 got in, but thousands stayed outside.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorways between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to a national survey Hillary Clinton’s management to Bernie Sanders has narrowed on the side
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton will continue in the double-digit leadership of the Democratic nomination competition, but Senator Bernie Sanders will catch him.
Clinton now supports 47% of Democratic voters (decreased 58 percent), and second Sanders supports 27 percent (accelerated 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential competition, but he is worth 15% of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, the majority of democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote.
Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choice, however, stricter than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has fallen among several population groups since the CBS News Poll survey last month, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has decreased significantly, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead in the field of democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he is now on levels with Sanders.
Clinton, however, clearly leads with older voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders leads this group with five percentage points.
Around half of the country’s democratic voters say that they are eager to support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says that they support him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six per cent would not support him at all.
It’s not very surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who are not currently up to Clinton - only a quarter would eagerly support him.
While 48% of democratic voters say that they are eager to support Clinton, Donald Trump, the Republican leader, says a rarer Republican voter (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had a suitable experience (16 percent), after which the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the female president (13 percent) and that he is the best candidate for the task (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the opportunity to be selected were also mentioned.
Since the vice president has an impact on the potential presidential nomination, 57 per cent of democratic voters would already want to see him in the competition - although a third disagrees.
When asked who they would choose from the Democratic voters for the second party's appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue a democratic candidate, Hilary Clinton's management from Sanders will grow, and if Biden goes on board, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the number will be 30.
55% of Democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
On this scale, Biden remains far away, but the share of those who consider him to be the most voting has increased.
However, when the democratic voters were asked what is most important in the candidate, they put their opinions ahead of the voteability.
Also, last month no Democratic Candidate or possible Candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Candidates of the Democrats or potential candidates are doing well in certain key issues among their party voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, reliable, and strong leaders.
Biden manages the trio best in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
30 percent of democratic voters say that Clinton is not honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they have no opinion about Sanders.
Democrat voters also generally consider that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agreeing.
Considering all these points, about a quarter of the Democratic voters say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton’s personal email address and server use as his foreign minister still raises questions, most democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and say that the matter did not affect their overall opinion of him.
However, the matter is different when we consider America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The opinions of the people were divided in March shortly after the matter came to daylight.
Most Americans say that their overall opinion about Clinton was not affected by the email polem, although 36% say that their opinion about him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion about Clinton has worsened.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters, only 32% consider him honest and trustworthy, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say Clinton isn’t honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of all registered voters in the whole country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, are considered good leaders.
The six Biden, Carson and Bush candidates are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many have no opinion about him, just like not Carson.
The margin of error in the study, which included 351 democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
In a new survey, two candidates gathered half of all votes, leaving others to fight for their foothold.
Republican voters, through the country, are still strongly supporting Trump, whose support has risen from 23% of the previous CBS survey, published on Tuesday, last month’s Fox News election debate, to 27%.
However, Carson rose at the same time from a whopping six per cent to 23 per cent.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is displaced by Trump’s high-level Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasichi, and the support of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has dropped most: from last month's 10% to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio rank third in 6 percent.
The margin for error in the sample of this latest survey conducted in September, 376 Republican voters is +/- 6 percent.
Last week, the latest CNN/ORC survey showed Carson to be on the rise in surveys: he has a 19% support with Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32%.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson gained popularity last week, Trump criticised the retired neurosurgeon in vain, although Carso apologizes for questioning Trump’s faith.
We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are accused of the death of Baruch College’s first year student
Almost two years after the student died in the submerged ceremony of the Brotherhood in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been raised against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi brotherhood of Baruch College in New York had brutally attacked Chun ‘Michael’ Deng during the membership rite in September 2013, and then delayed in taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police noted.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with over 13 kilos of sand, after which he was repeatedly trodden on the ground as he tried to walk through the icy field towards the goal.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurts, after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng fainted, but, according to the accusations, waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, the police says.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, look for information about his symptoms online, and contact the national president of the Brotherhood Andy Meng for advice from him,” said police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference.
At this point, the members began to hide their ritual gear and thus practically put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng,” said police chief Wagner.
Deng was not revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng received repeated blunt object shocks on the head, body and thighs.
Too many families have suffered from a brotherhood contraction, when at least one student has died as a result since 1970,” Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in his statement.
The Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step of the authorities is important.
The great jury of Monroe County advocated that the first five members receive charges for third-degree murder
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also prosecuted for violent chopping and criminal intrigue.
”We don’t want to be held responsible only for individuals, but if something has been done behind us that accepted the situation either officially or indirectly, they should also be held accountable,” Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College forbade the fraternity and the national fraternity dissolved its connection to the local department.
This happens when the US central bank raises interest rates
The increase in interest rates will come, and the market for rising courses will fall, the proceeds of bonds will rise, and the economy will have to regress.
This is what we know.
What we do not know is how long it will go to all this or how long it will last.
The past gives little help when it comes to timing, especially when it comes to the economy.
After the first drawdown, the recession has lasted for only 11 months, and sometimes it has gone as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US central bank in raising interest rates has often been, albeit not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, the officials of the Federal Reserve have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it, because interest is raised, but mainly on the development cycle of the period to normalise the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all interest rate hikes have been oversized.
The central bank’s first increase after the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles to end the ‘cheap money’ period,” said Julian Jessop, Chief Financial Specialist for Global Affairs at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
Instead, we don’t expect the gradual return of US interest rates to the normal, although still low, level is the kind of revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effects.
Below is a look at how some aspects of the economy will react based on previous developments:
As seen on the market in the past about a month, waiting for the interest to rise can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
It seems that capital returns tend to stop for 12-24 months after the first raise, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the central bank raise.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market is generally strong, about 14% rising when approaching the increase, 250 days thereafter the situation is fairly stable (average increase of 2.6%) and the normal state is achieved after 500 days with an average return of 14.4 percent in the last six cycles, says Bob Doll, the leading capital strategy for Nuveen Asset Management, which was published in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche Bank, the effect on shares is usually clearer at a later stage of the raise cycle when the income starts to decrease.
Recessions are part of economic life, but interest rate hikes often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed before and that can speed up the recession.
In particular, this is a gross domestic product, which will be closest to its lowest ever level before the interest rate hike of the central bank.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 withdrawals made since 1950 have only been less than 4.5 per cent of nominal annual GDP.
Although the figure was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will remain when the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, says the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic setting can be risky and raise the question of ‘whether this time is different’, Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for the central bank raise throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and financial experts believe that the committee can accept the raise at this meeting, futures trading only predicts the probability of 25%.
Our study shows that since 1950, all raise cycles have so far experienced an increasing leverage in supercycles where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery has started,” the report says.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has expected the longest time since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is already underway.
Fixed return has also been unstable as the market waits for interest rate hikes, and the model resembles some observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are reflected faster in bonds than in shares.
The direction of the bond yields seems to change immediately at the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the yield on the notes will decrease immediately,” Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategies believe that raising interest rates will cause longer-term and shorter-term bond yields to converge, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-yielding bonds often produce better in such a situation, although “we are still careful about finding a return,” said Schwab’s fixed income analyst Kathy Jones in one analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the bank’s policy expectations.
In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for stricter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more consistent, the credit margins have increased and the volatility has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its alignment.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly based in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debts perform worse when rising dollar value makes their products more expensive in the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have financing.
History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more lucrative in the three months after the first rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts noted in their client report.
After the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases, companies with strong net sales surpassed the weak net sales by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than low-quality companies, with the first 4 (percentages) and the latter 3 (percentages).
Debt becomes a major problem.
Companies with high interest rates are losing the most," said Goldman.
Outside of stock exchange speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit with higher returns, even though experts disagree on how quickly the impact is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of “publicization”
He claims that its separation from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult
In addition, he targeted BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just mimicking the Brit Awards
Member of Parliament Damien Collins criticizes The Voice, saying it's not original
BBC Radio 3 is ‘changing’ to Classic FM, claims a leading member of the public, increasing the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio station seemed to “feel” its content, and that it was increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
It seems that Radio 3 - I don’t want to use the term “people’s sense” - is turning to Classic FM,” he said.
He also took over the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, will only appear to be a Brit Awards gala organized under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples of what I’ve just remembered when you just copied something that’s already in the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC President denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and information sharing for citizens.
Radio 3 teaches such things about classical music, which I cannot learn from anything else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first class.
In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must do more work than before to reach the audience, as the Brits know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC’s offering that was criticised for entering the toes of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Tory Party MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music competition that BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Media for £22 million.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and it is not unique in any way?
Lord Hall argued that this BBC1 channel program, starring Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in “a fairly BBC style”.
He added that he wanted the production company to “find success inside his own house” the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent the production of future The Voice seasons, or to order that the money of the licensee be used in other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month, the rise was lowest since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales strengthened the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown tremendously for over a decade and many of the British shopping streets have become haunted cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of e-commerce levelling in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew least since the start of statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales levelled out in the air when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Looking at the growth levels in previous years and going back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalized over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, supplier of the JMRG sales index, to Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people shoped online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it evens out, and (growth) can decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, has been considered one of the reasons behind slowing deals.
Experts believe that consumers are curbing shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, an average of five times more buyers flocked to their computers to grab trades, crashing multi-retailer websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which made buyers quarrel about the discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five were used online.
For certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains in shopping streets.
Muslims bury the dead in Mecca's crane accident, the consequences of Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during their first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the crash
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed
29 the dead were carried through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them; the victims died when the crane collapsed in the great Mosque of Mecca.
Mainly dressed in white, the mourners filled the route to honor the first dead who made their last journey to the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed the sacred place, where only a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and fell down worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed that the Bin Laden family of construction group was guilty of disaster, where 394 people were also injured.
The 29 bodies of worshippers killed by the fallen crane in Mecca Grand Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children of Qasim Akram Bolton from Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that hajj Mecca will continue as thousands of people constantly arrive in the city.
Today King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
In the Arabic version of the decision, which was published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, it was said that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the News Agency did not mention this detail, but it was said that the company’s directors are prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to investigate what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had assembled before this month’s hajj pilgrimage.
Binladin Group has not published any reports on the collapse of the misery and its representatives have not been caught for commenting.
The royal decision also blamed the fact that it did not use up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorologist authorities.
There are dozens of crane cranes around the Mecca Grand Mosque, which are part of a huge construction raid led by Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi Arabian monarchy for decades and is leading major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious boy whose family banned in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that every Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered one million rials (£174,000) to be paid to relatives of the deceased and permanently injured.
Other injured people will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says East European cheap workers are behind popularity
The Brits are increasingly using assistant services, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, Screwfix trades for professionals are opened 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country
Author Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent for Daily Mail
The British say they give up their hammers and paint brushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home improvement work
It seems that if you are clever with a hammer or a hook to paint the walls, you are in a minority today.
The Brits are increasingly hiring assistants to take care of do-it-yourself jobs in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, the owner of the home renovation store chain, said that behind the popularity is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a scorn price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new business-oriented Screwfix stores and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions made specifically by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single-woman households where more home improvement work is carried out than before.
Laury said: “The majority of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to look for a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of the five women who lead the most important companies in the UK’s FTSE100 index, and has rebuilt his management team so that there are as many male and female men in it.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in a group of exactly 50 percent of women, including its President and Chief Financial Officer.
Laury said: “This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the management team.”
Kingfisher announced a decline in both half a year’s revenue and sales after the group took over the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The government of the three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were quite fast.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force immediately, and as a result, the country will be standing on Friday due to the wide-ranging demonstration of its employees.
Many people think that reason also stands.
Let's ask if it's worth a strike when it's going bad anyway.
There is even a resistance movement established.
More than 50 000 people have already reported on the internet that you are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
This would have been impossible at an old good consensus time.
Of course, there was nothing online where to protest, but openly declaring to be a shearer would have been a small man’s political suicide.
The protest of a few ten thousand people among millions of trade unions does not make much of a moment, but it gives a reason for thinking.
The position of a trade union is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the perspective of the interest of the Ay movement, the government’s harsh solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to the sky.
When things have seemed to be rolling with their own weight for years, it is finally possible to defend, visibly and properly the rights of the employee in the unions.
In this way, the Government may wish to imprison the role of the trade union, when membership in the trade union is considered perhaps more necessary than before.
Let’s take any view of the activities of the organisations, so it’s out of the box that Friday’s mental expression would somehow stop Finland.
Yes Finland has stopped long ago.
For example, industrial production has been decreasing for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product is still decreasing, and unemployment is rising.
These things would be supposed to force everyone’s head.
Hard savings rate for the University of Lappeenranta: Aiming for 8.5 million savings, personnel reduction by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a cost-cutting programme aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operation negotiations concerning all personnel, with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means reducing approximately 130 employees.
In addition, the aim is to save two million other activities.
The co-operation negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which predicts that the actual activity will be 8.5 million deficits.
It is also affected by appropriations cuts made by the Board of Directors.
In this financial year, the university will achieve a deficit of about 2.6 million.
Expenses will increase slightly next year, but at the same time, funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university’s total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the saving target is ten per cent of the entire budget.
The impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Anneli Pauli, President of the University.
Before summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary financing appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will be initiated on Tuesday next week and they will last for six weeks prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in participating in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK’s largest rail transport companies,” Souter says.
Rail traffic is expected to gradually open to competition.
The first one is the commuter traffic in the Helsinki metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is in turn.
Souter says that he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, Onnibus’s plans are welcome at the Ministry of Transport.
At least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe, has announced that other international companies are interested in rail transport.
The US central bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows the page when the Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether to raise interest rates for the first time almost a decade.
When Reuters surveyed 80 economists a little more than half of those who believed last week the central bank would raise interest rates, now believe that the situation will not yet be resolved and interest rates will remain at the current level of 0.25%.
This is a historical event, because when the central bank cut interest rates to zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalising interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought in trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and created low inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for withdrawal, but the signs show that they also believe that probabilities are against raise.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University's sniper left an apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting his colleague later the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was “ sorry” for the first murder and wished to “cancel it,” the authorities said on Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier Police reported that the geography and social sciences teacher of Delta State University, Lamb, called the emergency number about ten in the morning
Monday and told him that he has shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send constals to his home.
He said that he “killed his wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “disturbed no one”, but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn’t tell it.
Lamb did not give an explanation for shooting.
When the police got there, there was the body of the 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a hand written by a 45-year-old Lamb, saying: “I am so sorry I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who has ever loved me.”
After writing the message, Lamb drove almost 500 kilometres to the Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before finally killing himself late on Monday while the police besieged him.
William LaForge, Rector of the University, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt in his knowledge, but that “clearly there was something in Lamb’s mind.”
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the arguments published on Monday that Lamb believed that Prentiss was related to Schmidt, there was no “information or evidence” of any kind of “triangle drama”.
Shawn O’Steen said she was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as “a good person”.
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Steen told her that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is “still”.
O’Steen told us that Prentiss and his daughter were “one of the best friends.”
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from his home online, and Sun Herald said that he was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told us that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
He always wanted to help other people,” said Knowles.
The police reported that Lamb had called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that “he will not go to prison”.
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that evening, Lamb stopped his car at the side of the road, left it there and set out to run into the forest where he was shot.
Lamb defended his doctoral thesis on education in Delta State in spring 2015.
Stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), in the picture with her son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001, he became ill with leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this really requires its taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw got a double fracture on his right foot as Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
While the defender stayed in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw would still be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by the reckless tackling of Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for 9 minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before taking to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, “He has a double fracture on his foot and he is now in the hospital.”
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day after, and then cut in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays brilliantly, and this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on top.
He cried.
I am not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least half a year, and he does not play in the block stage.
I hope she will be able to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal proposed that the Italian administrator be mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-feet tackling.
Shaw tweeted as follows: “Thank you all for your messages, the words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger.”

The English defender will have additional incentives to recover next June’s European Championships in France.
PSV Coach Phillip Cocu said: “It’s a really bad injury.”
If a player is thrown out because of such a disability, all are very sad.
Our players are never supposed to offend the opponent.
Moreno's foot broke when he played in Mexico against the Dutch Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
Moreno takes this heavily because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it’s a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I did not see in that situation.
The only thing that I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn’t see Luke tackling.
Moreno said to SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel horrible because of this, I’m so sorry.”
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
Kai David Cameron knows Lorax better than this?
Every parent will soon learn a thing: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long to learn it almost from the outside.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When a holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr Seussi’s book The Lorax, an environmental protection story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps company website and continues: “Fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message.I enjoy reading this book for my children because it always seems to be a picture or message that we haven’t seen before.”
All this is true, but the next chapter in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which a fairly short original text was filled with new characters and details.
In the city of Tarville inside the walls, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is merchandise, Ted the boy hopes to win his dream girl's heart by filling Audrey's wish to see the real tree", the text says and describes the love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, called Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this isn’t suspicious enough, Cameron’s text sounds as if it was taken from the Lorax movie’s plot summary on the Internet Movie Database website, which starts as follows: “In the city of Tarville inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even the air is merchandise, Ted’s son hopes to win his dreams for Audrey girl’s heart.”
Considering that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, in which a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has destroyed the greedy, wood-cutting and needy- weaving Kerskanen, without conveying to the story the short, moustached thing that gave the name of Lorax, who “speaks for the trees.”
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who obviously has never read a book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister’s spokesman said that the text probably came from the office of Cameron’s constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron staff, but did not comment more at that moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying aside from the English team, but it was still a hard place
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think that the last 3-0 serial loss is likely to occur.
I wouldn’t exclude a guest win from the bills either.
The Alastair Cook side can be less experienced than a team from three years ago, but it has good twisters and the team’s mindset is strong: they don’t have scars from 2012, just youthful positiveness.
Moeen Ali develops in his twisted passes and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dripped from the cricket team in England, he replaces Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth of the team has to understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good forwards in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged based on their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about choosing Joe Root before the release, because, as I have said before, players are the best pickers.
More than a hundred points, and Lyth’s season in the team could have continued, but he himself was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, another chance will come forward.
England’s head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he didn’t perform just as well as he could, and it doesn’t surprise me – Lyth is, above all, a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave the mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and at guests.
The only subject of the complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top condition, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes along and has a batter that I appreciate.
There is something about him as a cricket player that we saw early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 points against us in the field of Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this, of course, depends on the team composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in the opening next to Cook has been balled, which would allow an extra pitcher to be placed on the field but would keep four quick, and I am not against this.
I don’t understand why a beater could not hit there, and this left hand has already shown that he’s quite a cricket player.
Moeen did not necessarily do her job in her county in Worcestershire, but she is three to them and there is little difference in it.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games as the first lattice fell before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not recall the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a back-up pitcher, and, what I have been dealing with him, he feels very impressive to the young man.
People can look at his unpretentious stats - hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and think that it is gambling, but there are not too many pitchers and the pickers chose young people.
She learns a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach side.
The appointment of a Sri Lankan batter, Mahela Jayawarde, as a consultant in the games can prove to be a genius.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game and brings a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the games of the white ball and brings both energy and a merciless glimpse.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be part of international cricket, whether it’s gaming or coaching, and he has the same kind of appropriation as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested at one-day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Even though not everyone agrees, the coaches and those who chose do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on light grounds.
UK exits from the EU (Brexit) can make a profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron’s semi-wool renegotiation strategies to keep the UK in the EU are facing ever-increasing problems day after day, even if he doesn’t take into account the heartfelt Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn’s choice for the leadership of the labour party or the anger of the trade union central organization to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomatic friend recently explained that since the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own cause, some Member States are bored with the UK’s self-centered agenda, full of concessions that cause disagreements and disruptive changes in agreements that these states do not want in the most part.
In their annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Organisation of Trade Unions decided that they do not want to do so if they are to curb social protection.
We could even call it Dave’s and George’s selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without a local eye-doer, and then come home to win supporters for reforms.
Everything is all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outward inside the UK EU tent - “Don’t leave us alone with France”, Berlin says - suggesting that the shortest ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at the point where they don’t care about our source then.
Germany’s wary and moderate Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her work before it gets ruined in the same way that it happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Holland in France is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He too is a fading force.
Poland may soon have a national right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing on behalf of selfie Brits when their energy would rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the United - they do not want that either due to similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend presents, some of these ministers can even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
The renegotiations had been arranged” and “Renegotiations didn’t matter to Britain.”
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street newspapers can be and how EU skeptical the singles of the press are, what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership that started in 1973 was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They can dimly remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro opportunist, who made a name for himself by writing “EU direct bananas” when he was in Brussels as a correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband was perhaps a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax aliens, phone hacks, and people who are nominally located elsewhere, and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought about them just the same, but realized that if you are in a cage with a lusty gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of the confusion unless you want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blairish than Blair herself when it comes to Cameron's renegotiation trick, which was adopted to the principle behind the EU's abandoned constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgives him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who clapped me nicely on his back at Westminster Parliament on Monday (I told him he no longer has time to waste me), seems to be at risk of re-accepting Neil Kinnock's 80s boycott of the Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position in Europe is, beautifully speaking, developing.
He says that he wants us to stay in the renewed EU.
Well, most of the people outside of Ukipi’s war goal enthusiasm and the most savage nationalists of the conservative party can surely settle behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan" Benn said this way both on the radio and on TV this week, when his internal scout wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint Karski John McDonnell as the secretary of the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his paternity struggled on the TV, trying to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Working Party without going so far as to lose his seat of government.
Hilary's efforts were more attractive.
But the struggle for keeping up with the “study anywhere” - Benn's utterance - wasn't what McDonnell said, and in all respects, what Corbyn told the heads and representatives of the people at a private meeting on Monday evening.
No matter what kind of non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of 24-hour television, and especially in social media swirls, which is a favorable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it’s just fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing her to support the Labour Party in the referendum campaign self-evident.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks so.
But the basic tour between McDonnell and Corbyn about EU membership (and being in line with their regulated economy of Benn and anticapitalist past) is no longer just a difficult-to-understand discussion with left-wing thinkers for whom narcisssism of minor differences is a key dogma in educational squeaking.
When it comes to his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby’s campaigns will not be handed over), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their supervisors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have suspicious voters) for concessions to Britain when it can be completely useless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed with the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cost-cutting Conservative Government, as I was reminded at the start of the Monday British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England’s e-cigarette assessment
Researchers have said that the State-funded agency’s claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of which had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet to criticise the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
Last month, PHE published its report “the milestone” describing it as “a comprehensive review of evidence”.
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published a editorial that attacked the exceptionally hilarious bottom of the PHE General Conclusion.
Two other researchers written in BMJ have considered whether the claims were “built on rock or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of public health is that practices must be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say that the public expects that the PHE’s argument ‘according to the current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco’ is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people, where the Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model was developed to synthesize their opinions on the harms that are combined with various products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was previously announced to have received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the public health powers of the BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced that they had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The selection criteria of the panel members are not explained, but the panel includes several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom say that the research has received funding in the field.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
PHE’s Tobacco Director also attended the meeting.
The study ‘much-speakingly admits’ that there is a lack of ‘indisputable evidence for most of the products and most of the criteria’, McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that PHE claims that “so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a route for burning children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, says that the claims presented at BMJ have been responded to earlier.
He says: “Electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than burning.”
Half of those who have burned their life will die of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively low, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty compared to relative risks to tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die annually from smoking-related illness, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion annually.
By explaining the current evidence – even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco – we meet our national responsibility.
BBC should give up Eastenders, says former Channel 4 leader
Former Channel 4 president, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would “give anything” from hits such as this soap series on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that license fees should only be used to make programs that other UK broadcasters don’t do.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programs that are likely to have a smaller audience, for difficult broadcasting times against the most viewed programs of competitors, and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company would like to collaborate more with other organizations, Johnson said that he once tried Channel 4 for six years to establish a relationship with BBC, in vain.
I don’t understand that the BBC produces and broadcasts programs that would be clearly suitable for unsubventional competitors,” Johnson said to the communication committee in the upper room as part of its research into the future of the BBC.
If the permit fee is adhered to – and I’m not sure that it would be a good idea for this message or long term – it should at least limit its production to programs that others don’t do and produce.
The Voice is sent to the most important broadcast time, as the goal is to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else is showing the program is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why regressive tax should finance programs that could also be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and Eastenders another, without a doubt implemented inside the house.
frankly, the other channels would give anything about it.
I don’t understand how it’s about sending public service.
I don’t think it would weaken the BBC at all.”
Leading the Channel 4 in 2004-2010, serial entrepreneur Johnson said that BBC is committing to the hunt for viewers “due to the goals of the people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support.”
He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC would sell such sets as Eastenders.
Johnson said that BBC’s smaller public service programs “go to the BBC4, where it is often not possible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fills its responsibilities and then can, when defending £4 billion of license fee revenue, say, ‘Of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that no one looks at’.
They put them in the dispatching place where no one will ever look at them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson said to the committee: “I challenge you to find a more regressive system in who gets the most value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think that in £150 a year you get a lot of value, but I don’t know if it is true for those people for whom £150 is big money, because they don’t use BBC much.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also proved to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its Reith mission to “disclosure, educate and entertain.”
He said that only a small part of the BBC production is classified today as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take the model from the Australian and Canadian broadcast radios and change the task to “communicate, enlighten and entertain”.
When it comes to partnership issues, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events like Proms, which he says will only be shown on television with some, and allied with commercial companies in such a way that all of these would be viewable online.
Sound genetics" enables the control of brain cells by means of sound waves
The video shows how the shuttle worms change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to be controlled by sound wave eruptions.
Tiny shuttle worms change direction as soon as they are subjected to a sound impulse that is too high for human ears to hear.
The impulses work by switching on magnetically modified motion nerve cells with reactive membranes that react to ultrasound waves.
Related: Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
Researchers said that worms show a new method known as sound genetics, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Salk Institute researcher Sreakanth Chalasani from La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses to treat Parkinson’s disease are directed to the human brain.
The shuttle worms normally do not react ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles strengthened the ultrasonic waves, which then enter the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures that are present in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, says a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to manufacture ultrasonically controlled shuttle worms, Chalasani mechanically modified worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified worms, the microbubbles strengthened the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms where they switched on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light that needs to be sent along optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue in an accessible way, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
We believe that using gene therapy and the therapeutic virus can allow target human nerve cells to momentarily react to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment,” said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to your home!
Advertisements put British arms trade to shame
Watch the video against Amnesty International.
Terrible killer machines!
Ankle crushing leg braces!
Grape bombs!
As well as electronic stunning batons that cause painful pain but do not leave traces!
The happy voice and comic language leaves no doubt that this advertisement for the world’s largest military trade fair is a sharp parody that Amnesty International produced to highlight the British government’s willingness to trade weapons for oppressive governments at the Defence and Security Equipment International ExCeL Centre in London’s dock area.

With a separate campaign, there were also many posters for bus stops and metro trains that require more detailed examination.
Important information, Do you travel on the DLR route on September 15-18?” is asked together using London’s original font and brand, the DLR track as the image of the tank.
This September, a pack of gun merchants will arrive on the DLR route... Guests are asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters are created by artists who worked at the Banksy Museum of Cruel Designs.
The Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using the ‘Ad Space Hack Packs’, a pack of six pounds of hexagon keys that, according to the collective, “access to a third of the advertising space on the entire planet’s bus stops’.
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized “poster vandalism”.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs Curator and University of Essex Lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to non-gallery audiences.
A lot of artists have started working with activists in opposition fronts when they have realized that they need to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-armament poster greets commuters in the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been watched via Facebook over 100 000 times in the last 24 hours, created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also the graphic designer and background commentator worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Leverin found that gun fairs were not advertised at all - and there was also an empty point in ExCeL’s calendar then - and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they are trying to avoid.”
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for obscure corporations, but “it was more stopping to emphasize the issue with bright colors and animation”.
They have done a fantastic job helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair,” says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
Now the UK government must take action and make sure that the torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the gun fair comes from the inside of ExCeL when exhibitors are looking for fantasticly beautified products.
Saab unveiled an order from the U.S. Army for the “on-the-shoulder AT4CS RS” in its press release.
This includes a “unique tube-stacking tip that targets excellent effects behind the armor inside the target.”
Whatever it does, it is not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student residence
It’s been 11 years since I moved to a student residence when I was ignorant at the age of 19, when I still believed in barts and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the people I’ve annoyed with the forced smiles – and numerous, long complaints from others.
Much of my learning can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can be anything from nerves to completely scary.
It’s tempting to chat: tell me where you are from, whether you have a gap year and what you think about Corbyn, and why “I really don’t love or hate Marmite because it’s just yeast extract HAHAHA to find me in my room.”
Take a breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like and not the ones you would not like to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they shared fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often transformed into cocktail parties, movie nights and public places, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think you're starting a university while in a relationship
The university is a hard place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of wandering from one room to another, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell for someone who is trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say “I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you must now leave that I can recover the energy I consumed when talking to you”.
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing - and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when speech came: knock.
One type in my student residence thought that if the door was not locked, he had been invited in.
He saw quite things.
Be friends through baking.
Since you start a university during the peak of the baking trend, knocking on people’s doors with a chocolate pastry plate and introducing yourself seems to some extent less strange, less “welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions” from the -50s.
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your residential partners feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will connect your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat blobs are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking someone’s chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they give you permission even if you boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get a sympathy - but try to deal with it more than my dormer who mixed his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He is now in prison.
You shouldn’t be noisy so that people can’t sleep or study.
Not only to be a decent person, but because you are like that proverb's stew playing pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally silenced at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before making their own music roaring, locked their doors and went for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory with you?
Or inversely, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you considered a dorm partner to be your future spouse, would you come together, divorce, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your common friends for him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot dorm partner isn’t your future spouse, you could even try to talk sense down.
In the exhilarating moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the limit between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but can be cancelled in an instant.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys into a glass of water, which you then put in a freezer - but do not attach their belongings with a blue sticker to the ceiling no more than twice.
The racist blow of foreign students’ accommodation in Kitee - houses planned to be a reception centre were scrambled in Salo
A racist attack on Kitee in North Karelia was made on Saturday.
Unlike the police told earlier, it is not an accommodation for minor asylum seekers, but a sleeping area for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at Kitee’s Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodation were frowned with racist signs, such as hooks, and a metal object was thrown through one of the accommodation spaces’ windows, says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who was responsible for the youth social guarantee training at folk high school, there were about ten people in the building subject to vandalism at the time of the strike.
There was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
Folk High School has people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All people in a messy building have a status.
Some are studying at an adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A-status is a continuous residence permit that can be granted to a foreigner who has been in Finland for four years at a time.
The police of Eastern Finland investigate the impact as damage and the violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, an information event was held on Monday for students, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here and no one has wanted to go away.
We have had foreign students for over a dozen years, and this is the first time something like this happens," Luukkainen says.
According to Luke, the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
The perpetrators are suspected to have been at least three men and they had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the end of a youth weekend evening when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," says Luke.
Salo also has a hospital that has been planned for.
The case happened last week.
MTV reported the matter on its website on Tuesday evening.
On the wall of the hospital was a swaddler and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal report has been filed with the police.
Revision 15.9. at 16.02, corrected incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of people who lived in the building.
The state discontinues the Y-train to Karjaa - passengers in their noses, "just idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news was indignant at the Helsinki Central Railway Station for passengers arriving at the beginning of the train in question.
In particular, the way down strikes the Siuntio residents,” said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
Idiotic because the number of residents is growing all the time and those working need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot be anything but a political will - or a lack of it.
Bengtström says in HSTV’s interview video that he will come to the capital with a tractor.
There are also train changes in the rest of Uusimaa.
The H and R trains running on the main track will be combined into a new R line.
Purola’s station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will not be used.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry purchases train services during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are discontinued routes throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will later be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio thinks that the state train cutter is short-sighted.
Let’s make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance on.
The Y train is also used by other people than Raseborg and Siuntio, as it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further away from the city area by train.
It's especially miserable for those who need to plan their trip again," he said as he pained the Y train.
A little relief is on the way.
There will probably be a new train connection to the coastal track, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL), i.e. take you to Kirkkonummi.
This brings additional costs to HSL, i.e. practically the municipalities in the area and their taxpayers.
We are now looking into the different options and their impact on the service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train in about one million years, the Ministry of Finance, of course, much more of this.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
Instead, the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease in the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Trains will be reduced on Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karelia, Port of Kouvola-Kotka and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys are made per year on the cancelled shifts, with a total of about nine million journeys in traffic purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the state.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Capital Timeliness book: "It is worth getting to know Marx"
Global economic crises have brought to the surface of the Capital of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, who is known as the former Chairman of the SKP, in a book published today, Marx’s current Capital.
He is now taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s assessments of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capital economy, the concentration of capital and the growing role of capital and fictional capital have proved to be amazingly far-sighted.
Aalto University’s professor, respected financial expert Sixten Korkman, is also on the list of authors based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen.
In Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever".
However, the former CEO of the Finnish Institute for Economic Research and the Delegation for Economic Affairs is not a Marxist?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences have differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary connoisseur.
The common notion is that the history of ideas tells about the false opinions of the dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went vigorously wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we will again discuss Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
Marx may be able to give inspiration to the one who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of a technical upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx will not be helpful.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
However, it is worth checking out the Marx in Korkman’s opinion.
In the 70s, Marxia could not be read," Korkman says.
Mao and Trotsky and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the discussion is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political ballast of the back years.
Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world - like other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a specialised court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lanka Civil War, says the news agency AFP.
The UN report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long period of deferment.
The report accuses war crimes of both Sri Lankan Armed Forces and Tamil tigers.
In the civil war in Sri Lanka, at least 100 000 people are estimated to have died.
There is no accurate information about the number of victims.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, a major military attack in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report is required.
The Sri Lanka Armed Forces report accuses tortures, abductions and systematic sexual violence that was as likely to be victims of men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been responsible for for forcing bystanders and children into fighters.
Both parties have committed murders according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice, as foreign judges.
English student experiment allowed to weigh up social media
On Wednesday, there was a long foreign language in the autumn’s student writings, most of which were English.
More than 16 000 trials were tested for English skills.
In the experiment, you could write the substance on social media, for example.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English-language 150-250-word letter could be addressed to the online magazine’s forum administrator.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish Leelia lounge chair.
He needed to be consulted on how parents could also look at things from the point of view of young people.
In total, there were four subjects of the substance, of which one had to be selected.
It was the hardest of them," says Mia Lybeck, the English lecturer at Porvoo's Swedish high school.
The third topic was only a quote from former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
According to Lybeck, the fourth topic was nice.
It needed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
At least in our school, speech writing has been practiced," Lybeck says and estimates that the whole test is "pretentiously normal".
In English - or Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that covered, for example, the adaptation of the summer flounder to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
Some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The writings of the autumn will continue on Friday, when it is the turn of another Finnish or Finnish experiment.
In general upper secondary schools, the test is organised normally, i.e. the demonstration of employees does not affect it.
The Matriculation Examination Board encourages pilots to find suitable connections in time so that they can attend the examination.
An extension may also be granted if it can prove that the delay was not caused by your own negligence.
In Oulu, trade was robbed with gun threatening
On Wednesday morning, a shop was plundered in the Kello district in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando hat covering his face.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and had received a small sum of money.
The matter is investigated as aggravated robbery.
The police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
The protest against the Government’s decisions on cuts will block the Helsinki city centre on Friday, predicted by the police.
Tens of thousands of people can come to the site according to advance information.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK federations will meet at Railway Square at 11.
The police are also believed to participate in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work, on the other hand, is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smoothing of the giant protest.
The roads leading to the Railway Square will be closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30-14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the west direction from Mannerheimintie.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Commissioner Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least it seems that it is enough.
I do not take a stand on the police’s industrial action.
According to Kujala, support patrols from elsewhere in Finland are coming to Helsinki due to a protest.
The police do not provide accurate patrol numbers.
Some of it is coming, but as a rule, we can do it with our own," Kujala says.
The police urge you to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump will reach the city centre from Hakaniemi level.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning until the beginning.
Due to the protesters arriving from elsewhere in Finland, there are also many charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They will not be allowed to the Railway Square.
Buses are basically left quite far away.
The rest of the trip must then be walked to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police’s point of view, there is a positive side.
The flow of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large crowd gatherings, is now partly taken care of by itself.
The organisers of the protest have informed the police that tens of thousands of opposition to the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to run smoothly.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finnish people are sensible and peaceful," Kujala says.
On Friday, local protests are also held throughout Finland.
Friday demonstration is unique in many ways - do you remember these strikes and protests?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good reference point for it in Finnish political history, says emeritus of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä Martti Sisiinen.
As such, it is no wonder that the ay movement protests.
If it didn’t, it would raise your hands in front of the government,” says Sisinen.
A very right-wing government has hit the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporationism - and also those points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The Government’s hard excerpts are lacking in contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the ay movement is really trying to get on their knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look at the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for the demonstrations of Friday.
What is new is now the sharp division that the protest will bring about among those who the Ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland showed their minds at the Parliament building in November 1993.
If Friday’s demonstration is looking for a comparison point, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, organized in 1993, Murrostorday, says Sisinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai gathered 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Aho’s (central) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the employee organisations were never as bad as during the bourgeois government of Aho.
Now the relations between the government and the ay movement are perhaps even worse than during the times of Murrostorstay.
Besides, Finland’s bourgeois government is now in power, says Sisinen.
The current coalition of government is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict right in spite of the speeches of basic Finns.
At the time of the twitch, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
On Friday, several thousands of protesters are expected.
The demonstration also stops public transport and may close day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the indivisible support of wage earners, it can become the largest for years to come.
Approximately 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year in recent years.
There are all sorts of them.
Traditionally, it has been quite peaceful in the demonstrations of the Finnish trade union – even though the practices have hardened in recent years.
Traditionally, in Finnish protests, we avoid conflict, we are law-abiding.
The protesters try to avoid harming or destroying the property, says Sisinen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
The EU membership nervouss farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pork on top of them.
The firefighters’ strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes for pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s metal and electric strikes
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power and power strike in 1977.
70 000 metalmen took part in the strike.
The strike was suspended seven weeks after the strike had lasted by the conciliation commission.
Metalmen received a 16% salary increase.
The spring 1977 electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages all over the country.
Breakdown Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20 000 people gathered in front of the Parliament House, many unemployed by the recession, to show their views on behalf of work.
Firemen strike three months in 1998
The firefighters’ strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
In 1994, the police attacked the EU as farmers protested against the egg.
Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
For Espa, the farmers dropped a tonne of snow.
Helsinki’s EU summit in 1999 also made farmers protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting venue.
Nurses Striked 1983 and 1995
Nurses stopped for about a month in 1995.
For the last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths that took place during the strike.
They threatened with a strike and the dismissals of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass dismissal eventually accelerated the negotiations to the result.
Doctors Striked 2001
Doctors in the strike - of necessity," was the slogan of the strike doctors in 2001.
The municipal health centre and hospital doctors’ strike lasted for five months and gave a lively discussion on how the strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5 000 students marched on behalf of student financial aid from Senate Square in Helsinki to the Parliament building in 2013.
The National Bureau of Investigation examines the backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested help from the Central Criminal Police to investigate the backgrounds of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped at Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Everyone on board the refrigerated truck was in good condition.
We have had the exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Investigation and main responsibility are at the venue in Austria, says Chief Commissioner of the National Bureau of Investigation Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling on a truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died apparently by suffocation.
According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE), the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company engages in restaurant operations and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for human smuggling.
Captain, former drug courier, and a sublime businessman beating refugees - the story of five smugglers
A sublime king of smugglers, a violent boater, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who considers himself a good guy.
For example, such people are engaged in human smuggling into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, working at Trento University, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and a book written by them The travel agency of Death will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions, and present smugglers from different levels of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll be banging them right away you think
The island of Kerkenna on the east coast of Tunisia does not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for the summer.
Due to its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres away.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, Emir lives, the captain burning in the chain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
This is what Emir has done with her blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8 000 euros after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Guests come from many countries, but during the Arab spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until again the refugee crisis broke out.
Customers arrive from the mainland to Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as she sees fit.
Food is provided so that customers just stay alive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the client runs out of money, it is their problem.
The water is discharged with lanterns that have been turned off at midnight.
On the first night, drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes seafaring is tough, and passengers cry and vomit in the 20m high waves.
At the destination, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir embarks on a return journey.
Emir wants her to be feared.
That’s why he beats his customers and at least claims he’s beating the hangers from life.
He says in a book that when the police once saw him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
I seized customers one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in a book.
The calmest passengers come from the south of Sahara.
He will have to abuse his fellow countrymen for this.
I’ll cut them off at once.
They must be immediately shown who is going to be here.
A regular taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the historical draws on his last and it has also seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi moves in general and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mainly accessible to families.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men without their families stay in tents, sheds and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest also live in the forest, who for one reason or another have not submitted an asylum application in Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often exhausted - through Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weekly walks in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
Eventually arriving in the Bogovaða region, a large hub for human smuggling, people are dying tired.
The Goran Islands are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran praises.
According to him, Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran does not like it.
Fool the goby all the way.
First, the price is for example 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I am not interested in money.
I only do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran says that he works cheaper than others and bills only 50 euros for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is three hundred kilometers, most of the roads comfortably.
Colleagues ask for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his riders one kilometre from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and whistles away.
At work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese is called a Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He really has a protestant church in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, with a lot of believers fleeing Congo, as well as a small center to help the Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees that he is doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes many times a day and makes sure that the elastic band of the white dressers looks stylish under the low waist of the jeans.
The Missionary is proud of its new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and onward to Europe.
The customer will first call one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hides the money in a witty manner, and passes across the border with the merchants.
In order to obtain an asylum seeker or refugee status, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that there are, for example, Northern Kivu war zones, and that they have had to flee their home from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary will organize a new identity for the client.
The old personal identification documents will be destroyed and another one will be acquired.
It helps the Missionary contact with the Ugandan police.
After this, the customer will be redirected to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, to NGOs, finally to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy, because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He bills each step separately: filing an application to the Ugandan police will cost about one hundred euros, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation about 150 and moving to a European country, for example, 4 500-7 000 euros.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
In his forties, an Irishman is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his work is to load people into trucks on his way to Britain.
He is assisted by a Afghan, French taxi driver living in London, as well as dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the center of Calais.
They drive the A26 motorway and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would be directly imprisoned for illegal immigration.
Tom does not want it, he has been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs over the highway to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the UK.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - it must be ensured that it is on his way to England, not to the Netherlands, for example - and cut through the protective cover safety cable.
It has to be done quietly so that the drivers don’t wake up.
Sometimes the driver is in the plot, but then the hustle and bustle is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customer in aluminum foil, a similar one wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police thermal scanner from detecting the hider.
Some people use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customer's truck and leaves the scene, hoping that he wouldn't catch any smugglers at least before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world’s most famous human smugglers.
From Upporik, Turkey has been called the marketing champion and the undisputed king of Mediterranean irregular landings, which dominates sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only requires the money to arrive.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: Turkish ports rent yachts along with exporting US or European families for a nice few days of touristic cruises.
In reality, the vessels are loaded to the brim of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, which are transported for a fee of EUR 5 000-7 000 first from Istanbul by land to a port and from there by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human stores, for example in old industrial halls, until they have time to leave.
People are cramped into minibuses and driven somewhere on the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, you have to get on board quickly.
Passengers must keep the entire journey hidden under the cover.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a group of people visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers outsource and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately 53 000 euros for one luxury vessel trip after the cost.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller employees to take care of the work on his behalf.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred homes he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time with a member of parliament of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur of the pharmaceutical industry.
Since then, he is apparently gone.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Agency book will be published this week, not next week.
American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, who has competed three times at the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending his career and drifting into a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the tournament in top condition and ran for the second best time in qualifying.
In the final, however, he was paniced.
At first he rushed to the top and defended his leadership position with a manic run.
150 metres before the goal, however, his strength was lost.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other rivals passed him one after the other.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide one year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt enormous pressure on success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strangers.
He also overspeaked his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton’s price was 450 euros per hour.
He says that he used the money for luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations of becoming a prostitute was also that he needed the same adrenaline spikes as he had had when competing in athletics.
Favor Hamilton later found out that he was suffering from two-way mood disorder.
The double life of a former star runner became apparent at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was number one in the world by 1500 metres during 3.57.40, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The World Champion rejoiced when the alliance put the Norwegian ski cock under control: "Straightbacks"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of fit with at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have wrestled all summer and autumn, as in the past year, from an athlete’s agreement.
Although the Federation has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a world champion and Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming World Cup.
The decision was praised by two world champions Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the alliance put the ski cock in order.
Thank you for showing your spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the team for the season so that he could promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent the alliance, which will also take care of future generations, and will not give one athlete with solos.
At the same time, he reminded that the union has given Northug financial and other privileges for several years.
I know it because I have been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because it is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release, in which he assured that he wanted to play sports in Norway next season in the World Cup as well as in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championship medals, of which two gold medals.
He took part in a team that won the relay gold last winter in Falun.
Fried translators’ shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Kilpis Day, 25.9., events take place in various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Fried Translators’ Shield.
The aim of the day is to emphasize Finland’s high-quality food expertise and to lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of its high quality.
At the same time, we would like to point out that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but that top-notch restaurants inspected and classified by an independent operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention gained by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
Old Town Restaurant participates in the shield day in Kokkola.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most important international events organised in the same day around the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-magazine: The establishment of the Kauhava reception centre complained to the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are co-founding the reception centre for refugees at the Kauhava Ex-Garrison premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region still has a permanent critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the Finnish Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Eriverkot Oy.
According to Kauhajoki magazine, the placement of a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Finnish Defence Forces may have interests related to the former Air Force Academy area and the airport, the impact of which has not also been determined in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The article states that for the past two years, the Kauhava airport has had negotiations on the organisation of flight training and the result of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, for example, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (Ps.) and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Räty.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint does not concern a fundamental objection to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is incorrect.
The Kauhava City Board handled the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, says Niinistö, after meeting the Presidents of all the parliamentary parties in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the root issues.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and Russia and the United States may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also ignored in discussions.
The President did not comment on the labour market situation.

Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers in the demonstration of the whole Friday
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday’s demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The association of tram and metro staff told STT in the evening.
The majority of the alcoves close for two hours, including mails closed
Friday’s demonstration also causes disruption to Posti’s services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, in the delivery of day mail.
The majority of Posti’s service points are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are handled despite the strike.
Meal deliveries, hospital consignments and laboratory samples are also being handled.
Information on the services is available on Posti’s website.
Most of the Alko residents of Finland close their doors on Friday for two hours.

Pam has also invited employees of grocery trade to participate in the demonstration of trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the stores will be kept open by their supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is not yet any information about the closure of individual stores.
Helsinki daycare centres partially closed
Helsinki Daycare Centres do not operate to their full extent on Friday, says the Helsinki Early Childhood Care Department.
Due to the protest of trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day-care centres, and club activities at kindergartens and playgrounds will not be arranged.
Day-to-day day-care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for students with intellectual disabilities and autism are normally organised.
The Early Childhood Education Department promises to inform more about the changes in its operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one of the other channels.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the repeat way of the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches comes.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be transmitted on Yle’s channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then let's see.
Now this channel is being used tonight,” Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to be given to citizens.
This whole of things, which we are talking about now, is quite complicated and requires a longer justification.
That’s why we ended up in this channel,” Sipilä explained.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be viewed at Yle Areena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television speech will not tell more general about the government’s inward turn.
Is it attempting to take the right to define public debate more closely into your own hands and to refuse questions related to public debate?
I am reminded of the recent comment by Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media has been indignant at Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn’t react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
The task of the media representatives is to aim, by definition, to ensure that politicians’ agendas are not included in the agenda.
Koivunen says that television speech is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more what we have already heard today?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old one, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Even Yle takes this risk in that sense, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
The risk is that the Finnish Broadcasting Company will be stamped as a message by politicians or Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in accordance with the interests of the Finnish Broadcasting Company or the general policy.
Sipilä’s cunning pull
In Sipilä’s forthcoming speech, it is also important that the Prime Minister ignores what the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, you should look closely at what Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuutti, TV talk is a sneaky bet from Sipila, as this allows her to bring out her own vision without gravel sounds.
This gives the message a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike the press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something about the speech, because more specific questions cannot be asked.
According to Kuuti, it is very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether the sweat is thrown, whether the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipilä with a father figure, who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to present her case well, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government would inform about something, because in this a person as if talking directly to another person.
Such (U.S. President Barack) Obama and its partners engage in regular activities.
Really exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to be really exceptional to the public.
According to him, such has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher thinks that the Prime Minister wants this way to make Finns sympathize with the tensions ahead.
Employees’ organisations organise a demonstration on Friday and strikes against the government’s actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could speak about the state of a nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister’s announcement, which would allow the speech to be discussed as well.
Antti Rinne, Chairman of SDP (Social Democratic Party), announces his challenge to Sipilä’s dialogue.
Now there is no time for monologues.
Shortly six months from the elections.
You can’t hide in the endless, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy has been found in Tampere
The boy was okay at the time of discovery.
The boy has been found and okay, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inland Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy started to play out four times in the afternoon.
Later in the evening he could no longer be contacted.
The father would like to thank all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent fad of young people: You will create anger
Kurdish free-player Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook, in which especially appeals to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani made a heavy speech against the street brawls of young people.
Born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has won his two professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to view one Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account, where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed in the fad of young people.
Amirkhan is 26 years old and has over 62 000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick on the ground, sit on top of the other and strike eyelessly without thinking about any of these consequences as this happens when you make these videos, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people shown in the videos have immigrant backgrounds.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, the Helsinki Police Commissioner, fighting videos for social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and native Finnish young people.
It is the fact that you are fighting in the street in general.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite aggravated.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be a long time guests here.
That’s a little different way to thank you for being here,” Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become subject to any racism, you may accuse yourself of it.
Now think a couple of times before you go along with such, dudes.
Amirkhani says that violent activities contribute to racism.
You get the kind of anger that I don’t like.
You have things pretty bad anyway and you don’t cure them at all,” Amirkhani concludes.
SAK takes a stand on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of SAK, says on Twitter that on Monday, the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list proposed by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
STTK announced earlier that it had presented its own proposal to the Board on Wednesday that the five-percent leap in productivity required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
The Chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employee organisation SAK to soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of SAK, comments on the matter in a low-word way on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open a labour market lock", and that agreements made by active parties are needed instead of mandatory laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä’s proposal for a social agreement was not valid for SAK.
Sipilä previously closed negotiations on the social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the target of a five-percent leap in productivity.
Comment: The big demonstration threatens to be fed - "It feels a bit funny to thump your fists"
After all, it feels a bit funny to chop your fists, if there is already a matching paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies in the working camp from side to side.
Is it supposed to cries out the government or to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK’s federal leaders spoke of sacred hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to be caught.
Uho spread to the akava.
OAJ, the trade union of teachers, threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday OAJ canceled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), the chairperson of the Bureau of Finland STTK, made a conciliatory appearance.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he had prepared an alternative proposal required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) as a five-percent productivity leap.
Akava’s chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok), hastily announced that his paper is already ready.
At first, there was no yard in the SAK office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to match when the federal leaders just on Monday told to put the country on Friday to stand.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the Work Committee of the SAK will meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that the SAK will look for solutions to open the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, SAK should be able to accept a five-percent productivity leap as a goal.
It is no wonder that Palolan STTK has good relations with Sipilä’s Board of Directors.
Palola’s right hand, Director of Public Affairs at STTK Jukka Ihanus previously served as a special assistant to the Prime Ministers of Central Finland Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola says that the Board’s expertise has constantly improved.
A coincidence or not, but Palola’s output took a little bit of cleaning off the Finnish staggerers, whose front picture is by Marko Piirainen (sd) of ACP.
After all, it feels a bit funny to chop your fists if you already have a matching paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia barked Finland as a bad host: "This must not be repeated"
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, thinks Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki jubilee meeting in July.
In this case, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, on the European Union’s sanctions list to attend the meeting - a matter that the President could remind journalists of.
According to our estimate, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not be repeated, Naryshkin emphasized according to the news agency Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism focused on the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia without complexity, so Naryshkin continued to spike in Finland by praised and praised Mongolia for his "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will run constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (National Coalition Party) at Ulaanbaatar, who, according to Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Paints tight"
Tappara and Lukko continue in Hakametsä today, when both are in the fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today there will be no actual goals party in Hakametsä.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to drill 3-2 extra time gains from KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season’s silver group was at worst two goals in defeat.
The Tuesday of the lock was more frequent.
The guests of Blues, who started the Rauma residents, had a round zero point, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, the Lukko attacker Janne Lahti anticipates the set-up on the club’s website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for Rauma residents.
Tappara has, in the previous two seasons, just dropped in the semifinals from the final series of Lukko.
At both times, the solution has the required decisive seventh match.
Last season, Lukko already broke the series in the fourth game, but Tappara rose and passed by the next three parallels.
With the exception of goalkeepers, there are no major changes in the group compositions.
The cashiers who rejected both yesterday will get a flute today.
With the Tappara paint Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the lock posts Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of View: An Ace Running a Trashy Play
Sports Director Toivola wrote a ‘unsuitable’ sequel to Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It is a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a screenplay for Rocky, where he played the lead role.
The underdog gave a sensational sensation to the heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got great sympathy even though eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless ash story in Pori.
An anonymous and wooden-handed pot deck progressed to the Finnish Championship Finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matti and Pele Peltosta.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the riots.
Toivola became a blonde.
Great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The screenwriter Toivola believes that this new work will work in the same way as ten years ago.
The man who works as the sportsman of the aces has built a cauldron on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have snuggled in the trough like Rocky Pork carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in non-reel playing.
Toivola has forgotten that Pekka Rautakallio plays the main role in Rocky VI.
Karri Kivi has crossed Rautakallio to become Sean Conner.
Rautakallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in 1976's original work in Toivola's screenplay Rocky.
There is nothing more than a nickname in the Iron Rock.
Rautakallio’s gaming philosophy does not include scrambledness and small sniping.
He appreciates the hard game, but it is a different thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Aces took Tappara to Jere Karjalainen's head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those that deserve.
I do not accept such a game and it does not belong to an ace hockey, the hot Iron Rock rushed after the game to the People of Satakunta.
The team of aces this season is strangely built.
There are juniors, veterans, cops and degraders.
There are practically no key men in the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season’s events affect procurement and unfortunately the market was quite narrow, Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
Under the surface is smudging.
In 1953, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola place as a sports boss.
Men’s contracts will end in the spring.
Aces’ balance in the three league matches of the season is equal to many losses with goal difference 1-6.
Toivola would not have liked to write the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuki's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband as a teenager of Tuukka, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays under the guidance of her husband for the first time.
Yes, in the movie I will present my husband's friend's mother.
In a way, it feels crazy, actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanta ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temosen since 2008.
The couple has previously worked a lot together, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka’s guidance for the first time.
Olga’s role in the movie You Did Me Beautiful is played by drummer Sipe Santapukki’s mother Sirkka.
Sirkka encourages and supports his son, even though his father Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a voice of reason.
The more I have familiarized myself with Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
She is a great guy and I am grateful to Tuukka that she trusted the role for me.
Olga had met Sirkka already before the film project, but since then the duo has approached a lot.
They have met, spoken on the phone and communicated.
Sirkka has helped a lot.
We have gone a lot from different angles through their history.
Sirkka also fortunately understands that drama is a drama, and the truth may need to be slightly colored.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the 90’s there was a recession and a very gloomy one.
It was quite a small probability that someone really would succeed, but Sirkka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about Tuukka’s youth even before the film plans.
However, parents’ stories have sometimes been a bit different.
So, if you're a 15-year-old teen, then how much parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuukka, known as Heinola’s infamous skater.
Olga was a nice girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At most he could have been secretly charmed.
According to Olga, over the past 10 years she has collaborated so much with Tuukka that a big joint project does not scare.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production group leaves for the descriptions of the month in Heinola.
However, a couple living in Iitti is going to drive for their young children often for the night too, as the distance is not too long.
We take over the entire Heinola month.
They have warmly welcomed us, just asked which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 becomes Finland's most expensive play film
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of EUR 17 million.
The filming begins in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is one of the most expensive films in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been at Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The ongoing Angry Birds animation will also rise past Iron Sky 2, as the film’s budget is over 100 million euros.
Filming directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begins in October near Antwerp at AED Studios and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will go to Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not scared.
I've been sickly casual!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what kind of film should become.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It is great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited, and I can’t wait to show this movie to the audience,” he says to Iltalehti.
Originally, the budget for the film was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the manuscript developed, the budget also grew.
The budget is big, but there is a big market too.
However, 100 million people would be able to penetrate the film, because every angle of view and effects are so expensive.
Now everything is twisted so tight that there is nothing loose.
On Wednesday, the film’s production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond, which pays an annual interest rate of 4-8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined by the demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest after two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Juntti or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The fronts of trendsetters have recently been decorated with big logos.
Some time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos as Crocs ever.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or t-shirt was seen as a little bit of a moment.
But times change.
Sportiness has become the real megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sports brands such as Adidas and Nike have risen to coolness.
And as so often before, the boundary between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is already right for the moment, it starts to become irony and cool.
First came the norm core trend, that is, the winter fashion, where trendsetters surprised by favouring the most boring basics as a way to stand out from the mass.
Now, instead of the basic grey college, we put on the mesh shirt that has already been buried in the bottom of the cabinet, with the manufacturer’s logo on the front.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' signature striped jumpers, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have returned to street fashion.
The start of the jeans’ edge is now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the chest of Versace autumn blouses makes it clear what brand of clothing is all about.
Would you be ready to display logos as you dress?
The Russian politician published the proof: I didn't get stuck for hours in the tank hatch!
According to the claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015.
In the Russian media, colourful claims have spread over the past few days that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything to dispute the information.
He even posted an image on his own public Facebook page, where he seems to peek at the hatch of a armoured vehicle in a very good mood, and at least based on those images, it is not a question of getting stuck or getting angry.
Full nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle armor trailer, but it was a assault armor trailer BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in Ural.
I went in, looked around, and came out in peace," said Zotov to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn’t get stuck and I didn’t really spend five hours in that position,” he said.
On the TV channel of the Russian army, Zotov explained that he had admired the new technology of Russia at the exhibition, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That is why I was interested in what is inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the tailgate," he said.
Went in all tanks.
And even at the next show, I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also barked the author of the matter as a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and came out.
I'm tall and tall, but nothing that I'm stuck somewhere in a tank didn't happen," he said to Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photograph of the alleged jamming has been published, even though a total of 50 000 people visited the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck began with a story on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told about a tank hatch when trying and eventually threatened to shoot all those around him, unless he reached an impetus.
Later on, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organisers told their own view of the event.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But the MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But in no way did he sit there for five hours,” said Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot, the coordinator of the exhibition.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilä mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called richness sand pool to the ditch.
According to the company, measures to remedy the leakage have been started.
The pool has neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water from the flotation process.
In general, the water is pumped again for use as process water or directed to the environment via the surface drain field according to the permit.
The leak was approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected in the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to dam structures in the pool.
The company says that it cooperates closely with the authorities to monitor and rectify the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against overcutting
The country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) follows largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
In order to cope with financial problems, the organisation was rummaging Finland’s comprehensive structural reforms.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid days off would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire agreement system and unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, structural reforms are in agreement, but there are small differences.
The IMF’s assessment has a lot of contributory message to the government’s actions, but on the other hand, there is also a warning of what should not be overcut.
These include infrastructure investments,” Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanomat.
In the opinion of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to achieve 0.4% growth this year, which will accelerate next year to 0.9%.
Danske predicts that growth will be zero this year in its new outlook forecast.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic about this year.
They may have been the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was on a small increase in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention may have been paid to the weaker confidence in industry or other so-called softer metrics.
However, there are only a few percent decimals in the differences.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were highlighted as the possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for monitoring Iwata’s footprints, estimates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s task is to bring Nintendo into mobile games, but it doesn’t eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognized that hundreds of children who have come to Finland will disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of under-applicants are disappearing every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Adviser at the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear "under the ground" in a year?- A total of 156 asylum applications were submitted in Finland by a minor who came alone in 2013.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were submitted in 196 and 11 of them disappeared, says Kannelmaa.
The loss may be caused by the fact that the applicant has already been registered in another Dublin country and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the disappearances will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another member state.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 were made a decision to expire because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past 123 years,” he says.
Is the volume growing?
This year, by 6.9., we have received a total of 586 unaccompanied minors’ asylum applications.
There are no total statistics on minor asylum seekers who have lost this year, but the number of minor asylum seekers is therefore known and it has grown clearly, which is also likely to affect the number of missing asylum seekers, he emphasizes.
What happens to those who have received a decision to convert?
Will they also disappear, for example, to the "dark job market"?
This is difficult for the Finnish Immigration Service to assess, as the police are responsible for the enforcement of the decision to convert, emphasises Kannema.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) has been concerned about the growing population of unregistered countries.
He has taken action on the matter.
Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU Ministerial Meeting, said on Monday about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers to Northern Finland through Sweden.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see photos from devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a media pioneer who has lost his ability to work due to illnesses, is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced tools in its field.
The first information about the online advertisement was the online magazine Iltakasiini.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained on the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV shows for Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that she will find her interest.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitalised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonen tries to move out of his current Myrskylä home.
We cannot take all the goods with us.
I have slowly started to inventory and see where the goods are handed over.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any own use of TV and radio equipment.
After the recent strokes, it is clear that a man who has had a long career will no longer return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life’s work was archived at the National Audiovisual Institute already in the summer, whose representatives visited the box store to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to crack down worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the metro and trams decide today whether they will expand their power activities in connection with the Friday demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it is decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great in the field.
Night and shift allowance cuts are severely inflated by drivers, so the government’s plans to cut surcharges raise resistance.
Hirvonen thinks, however, that it is a kind of dilemma to stop traffic for the whole day.
If the metro and trams stand still on Friday, public transport in the Helsinki metropolitan area is practically completely at a stop.
According to VR’s information, trains do not travel between the morning and the evening moon on Friday.
Local and long-distance traffic will not move on Friday.
Trains left before morning will be driven to the destination stations.
According to HSL’s information, most of the buses will be depot.
ACP members will be absent from work on Friday from three in the morning to three in the Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by supervisors,” says Pirkko Repo, Communications Officer at HSL.
Repo says that HSL cannot tell exactly which bus services run on Friday.
Employee organisations organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to get ahead in Europe, says news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against humans.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas - the teacher thought his self-made bell was a bomb
In the United States, the 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher considered the self-made clock he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to showcase the output of his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, kept the clock looking like a bomb.
The police were invited, and the situation finally ended with the boy being handcuffed to the Youth Retention Cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of doing a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police reported that the clock had looked like a "film bomb".
The clock is in the police’s depot, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The case happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished for a three-day forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council of the country considers whether the case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK Rises - Labour Leader refused to sing a national song
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is opposed to the monarchy.
The review submitted by the right-wing press has also included members of the people of Corbyn’s own labour party.
This has offended the people, thought labor MP Kate Green in a broadcast company BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
In 1940, the Battle of Luftwaffe in Germany was honoured by the British Air Force.
The Workers’ Party defends Corbyn in its official statement and emphasises that he has shown respect to pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in a tremendous debt of gratitude to the heroism of the royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood quietly during the national song, the statement was stared.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the lines of labour.
Especially among MPs, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament, closing savings measures and increasing public spending.
Corbyn is for the first time to appear as a party leader in Parliament during the Prime Minister’s Question Hour.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should be asked.
Cameron was the leader of Corbyn's election on Twitter at the turn of the week.
The Labour Party threatened our national security, security and the safety of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his own account.
The cause of Minnesota’s family death still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a trial
The South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a week of family death in Greenwood, Minnesota.
The five-person family was found dead on September 10 and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children in the shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found a huge house in different parts of the Short family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million house and a successful company
The investigation of the case of Michael Siitar, Chief of Police at South Lake Minnetonka, is still ongoing.
The motive of blood acts is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on social media site AllNurses.com.
In the 2014 StarTribune interview, Short reported that the site had four million different visitors every week.
I have received 50 bids from the company over the past ten years.
I have abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Perhaps at some point I sell a business, but not yet.
The success was evident, among other things, in the fact that the Short family bought a magnificent house in Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as the dream of a car collector: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Case pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit.
The Achieve Test Prep, which offers a variety of prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short’s website had not been removed from defamatory comments on prep courses, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the case would have had a very significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the restaurant event.
This is great, Loiri comments with a good mood on her honorary board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros with its profit.
The artist legend Loiri was still embarrassed by the success of the Fabrice Duo in the major competition.
I still don’t think it has happened.
According to Loiri, the successful horse coach Korpi gets full peace of mind when working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I hold on to my nose," said Loiri.
An amazingly stunning gesture from the NHL star - "The biggest athlete ever made"
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to a hospital release, this is the biggest individual donation to charity made by an athlete of all time in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed an agreement with Canadiens worth eight years and $72 million.
Thus, Subban’s donation amount is significantly higher than his annual earnings of $9 million.
As a reward for its donation, Subban receives a lobby that bears its name from the hospital.
Players at Canadiens have helped the local hospitals significantly before.
A year ago, long-time captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same paediatric hospital and Saku Koivu collected a large sum of money for another city hospital, which provided the hospital with the necessary PET scanner.
You can order a wife in the Japanese café for the evening - food is served in a bikini and anssu is on
Theme cafes are a tough thing in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, rabbit cafe, vampire cafe, halicafe and now a wife cafe on the market.
It strikes lonely, sore and hungry.
Metro reported on the matter.
You can order a wife or husband from the Ore no Yome cafe in Tokyo for an evening.
It is a waiter who pretends to be the client’s spouse.
The "husband" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is faced with a mere apron and bikini on her head, while the husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all information about the length and weight of the wife candidates on which mattress they prefer to sleep.
Soon, 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against automotive security began to be prepared
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the industry, the release published by Intel states.
The board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
In the future, the company will update the report on the basis of ASRB’s research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting company, estimates that approximately 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network by 2020.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 percent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With ASRB, Intel can establish safety-related best practices and support the view that cyber security is a major component in the design of every vehicle connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52 000 euros in Finland!
Ford’s Focus RS model has been expected for years to come.

Favorite brand Kia introduced two new things at the Frankfurt Motor Show - this is the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation of Sportage is certainly more important than ever in Finland than ever before, with which Kia intends to take a larger side of the ever-growing SUV market.
The new Sportage, created under the direction of Gregory Guillaume, the European Design Director, is more round than before.
The wheelbase and outer dimensions have become a centimeter here and the car will cut the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is unchanged in its main features, but a 1.6-litre turbo has been added to it, which develops 177 horsepower.
More information about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption is available closer to sales.
We still have to wait a little for it, as the new Sportage will arrive in the spring of 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, new Kia Optimas arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a whole new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle-class buyers with improved driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
Optimize with 1.7-litre turbo diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace is accelerating as the 2.0-litre turbo engine Optima GT arrives alongside them.
At the same time as its income, the sale of the Optima Farm begins.
Chisu Returned to the Stages - Brave in a Brave Jumpsuit
Singer Chisu is part of the Life for Children concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue trouser suit has a striking, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully displays the graceful waist of the singer star.
The ensemble is crowned by a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.

Chisu's daughter soon turns a year.
The singer released his first single from a new album in August.

It’s been a nasty thing to do with music,” says the singer.
After a couple of weeks, Chisu will release their new and fourth album, Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired us to create new songs.
At this point, it is wondering if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astounding again - now shows breast
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives talks one after another.
She presents her pregnancy belly and breast outfit in a generously sexy outfit, last night at one o'clock in America, when she with her sister Kourtney Kardashian left her husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress as the flash lights flicker.
Lastly, Kardashian dressed up in an Amazonian maternity outfit when he visited a friend for dinner in New York just a couple of days ago.
The accessory was accentuated by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as it was from Friday last week, when a pregnancy belly was on display.
Hard laws of the model world: No home, you are lonely, competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted the right idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths clean from the model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you've been posing in top designers outfits in the previous season, the new season starts again with castings.
And every season new, fresh faces enter the industry, competing for work with veterans.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and it can take a year to stay in a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses accommodate their designs.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There is not just one sort of leanness.
Agent in New York may ask for a drop of kilograms, but in Paris it is then said that you are too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
During fashion weeks, the models and designers are constantly together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks run out, the difference is sad.
The models want this industry because of the possibilities it offers, but they are grubbered by the fact that everyone thinks that the work is just a presentation of clothing.
The models also want to have their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models yesterday in Tory Burch's act.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their next year’s collection.
Roope Salminen plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen performs Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I’m a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I’m performing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven’t wanted to meet the right Antti before the filming, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown of the people, so I think it’s good that I only learn his playing style from video.
I don't want to make imitation of a person.
The man who leads Roope Salminen and Dogs from nowhere does not go into the role.
According to a man, the Punks come naturally.
In the punk episode of the Stars, many were sure to see a taste, as well as if they’ve ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been pretty, but is always going to the fullest.
The main actors of the 1993-2004 film Teit of the Beautiful of Us, directed by Tuukka Temosen, were released in Apulanta.
The band’s core group, known to the audience, is presented to the general public by fairly unknown young actors.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki performs Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave tips for her future job last night, when she told Snapchat that she was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of her career.
Roope has already released a picture of her new look on Instagram yesterday, which she has had to implement for the film.
Roope, previously seen on the mustache and chin, has shaved her face to her shimmering cheeks, and dyed her brown hair to black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees in Europe in recent days.
Or should you tell us at all about it?
The matter does not have to be discussed by force, member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected and not let them watch the news alone, for example.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in mind and be distressed, he says.
However, if the child has come across the TV news about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth speaking up.
It is a good idea to visit the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he or she is asking for.
The child’s fears may be surprising.
They may not be those that the parent thinks he is afraid of.
You should not intimidate the child in vain, even if you feel anxious and scared.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Bigger children are likely to come across a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents should discuss the matter with them if the matter concerns the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world have things well.
Together with the children, the parents can think about how our family takes this into account.
After all, do you think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children as far as possible from anxiety.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This can be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teaching your child to help the weaker"
My own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child
Ball flash that strikes Vermo hard to control
Perttu Pohjola was able to hon the clump of Apilan Pallolama in mid-summer.
It only squandered the victories and second places until at the end of July a collapse occurred in Tampere’s ravages.
Since the stallion cluttered thoroughly, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a time for his shelter from a vet.
The explanation for the extinguishing was cleared in the end.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not from the mildest end, but it took two medications to suppress it.
As the Tapiola Pallomala had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was another SE mare after Taruntuuli in Turku in record time.
The clover’s Ball Lightning was very under pressure from a break when it had only been able to run normally for a few weeks.
With those things in mind, the small bending at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good race made a blade for the stallions.
The horse's hustle and bustle went on, and hopefully it would have evened out.
Clover’s Ball Lightning has been so-called humor horses.
When it has not been amused, it may have thrown fat without illness.
On a good day, however, the surgeon has detached from the stallions that the opponents have been amazed.
At short-term speeds, co-competitors can’t cope with the Ball Lightning, from which even warm-blooded rides come off.
In Vermo, there is a nesting run in the hopes of the Nordic Region.
However, the different thing is how Clover’s Ball Flash agrees to it.
It is quite difficult at the time of departure and may even stick under the boom of the departure car and one of it.
I hope the stallion would be calmer than Turku’s departure.
When the clover is in order, we can also come from the bow, and we will start driving with it from the victory, the coach's permission.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple's iPhones may be able to be removed sometimes in the future - but not all.
In the future, Apple may plan to remove some of its own apps from iPhones, says Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed, CEO of the company.
Apple iPhone has a set of apps that are relatively few to use: for example, FaceTime calls, Newspaper kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these apps is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update for iPhones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, Apple software removal is more complex than it seems.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems on some other phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other apps.
There are other programs that don’t work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue, as the company doesn’t want to waste memory space on users’ iPhones.
Euro area inflation declined to 0.1% in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1 per cent year-on-year, Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy costs.
In this way, Eurostat reviewed its estimate of 0.2% slightly down from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat’s estimate for underlying inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation in the EU-wide 28 countries was at zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Among the euro countries, consumer prices rose by 1.4 per cent in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative, according to the harmonised EU price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank’s (ECB), which is a 2% increase in prices over the medium term.
On average, the ECB forecasts an average inflation of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the increase will pick up to 1.1 per cent, the central bank forecasts for its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
US Fed next tries to tighten monetary policy
The United States’ next recession will begin in the shortest time of less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country’s central bank, the Fed, will again take a long time to raise its interest rates.
And in the financial markets, the downhill starts before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that they may start raising interest rates already this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
Therefore, the next recession can be turned on by the most recent autumn and as a course run on the financial markets before that.
Or at least this happens if the world’s largest economy and financial markets function as they have been habitual - and if they react to the tightening of Fed’s money taps as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, the strategies of Deutsche Bank’s London market research, in his extensive long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank delivered a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market after that.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have previously behaved during and after Fed’s interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at which key economic and financial market variables are now on the same or different model as at the time of previous interest rate hikes - and what may result from that.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a more lucrative condition to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before.
Not a year at the beginning of the recession
Over the past summer and early autumn, Fed’s monetary policy leaders have suggested that the time is ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates for more than nine years can start this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Executive Board convenes to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds interest rate in June 2006.
At that time, a relatively regular interest rate hike of 0.25 percentage points lasted exactly two years, with which Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
In 2007, financial market symptoms began with the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis fell into a global dispensational nightmare.
The great recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious adversities in the financial markets and the real economy started slower than has typically happened since the previous Fed interest rate hikes.
Correspondingly, the trials were harder and harsher than ever before the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have been sifting the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as changes in the financial markets since 1950 and in places since the early 1800s.
From the 1950s onward, the Fed’s interest rate hikes and their economic and financial impacts are clear.
The start of the recession has been less than a year since the first rate hike, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rise in the financial markets has ended within one to two years from the start of Fed’s interest rate hikes.
After the early 1950s, the Fed has alternately raised and reduced its key rate by a dozen different cycles.
Each time has differed in some respects from others, and the number of times is relatively low in the review, so it is hardly possible to deduce any certainty about the effects of the next interest rate hikes.
Strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
Not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The reasons for the financial crisis, let alone those who are guilty, may not be unquestionably discovered even through decades of research.
But three things for those who have led the crisis and increased its devastation are somewhat unquestionably clear:
1) In the 2000s, the Fed, the euro area ECB and other major global central banks considered their key interest rates too low.
They patched the tracks of the techno bubble, and increased the next.
2) Over the decades, the debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy, and even too much in the past, increased the impact of the excess monetary policy of central banks.
The largest debt bubble in economic history was born.
3) In most areas of the financial market, in particular, madly cheap debt financing, packed the largest exchange bubbles in financial history into real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly a controversy that the ever more complex leveraged financial markets were rarely dangerous and volatile as Fed and other central banks last drove interest upwards.
The financial structures on leveraged debts, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last as long as the interest rate hikes had begun and the debt financing costs had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, followed by a large recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give a reason for the thought by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for a long time, they have now been even lower for a longer time.
2) For a long time, indebtedness has not been crazy cheap as it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is at least cheaper than it is free.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not decreased, but now, in the various parts of the economy, there is a much heavier debt load than before the financial crisis or ever before.
3) As a result of the increased flow and cheaper circulation of central banks, liquidity has largely remained on the financial market and has huged the key securities and asset classes at its most expensive, either at the peak or ever before the financial crisis.
And not only do the strategies put the mood down with the warning signs on the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession to the model that has previously been.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are relatively higher than before the financial crisis, as Fed then begins to tighten his money taps more tightly.
Perhaps the future picture of the strategy of the French bank Societe Generale, Albert Edwards, is not as strange as it can seem suddenly.
For a good time, he has coached the bank’s international investor clients for Fed’s full translations:
First, the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it's time for Fed to quench the financial pieces with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to reduce up to 33000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are directed to HP’s business services,” says the company.
In November, HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., which will focus on enterprise sales, and HP Inc., which will focus on PC machines and printers for consumers.
HP was at its peak in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, the personnel had been reduced to 302000.
The company will record non-recurring costs of approximately EUR 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) from the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25000-30000 employees.
The reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP plans to transfer its operations to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that no one of its customers is responsible for more than ten per cent of its operating result.
In the second year, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to Get New Operating System on iPhone After Apple Update Release
To request a new operating system, go to the Settings app, click on “General” and then select “Software Update”.
If the update is ready, your phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems with this installation after an error message "Software update failed" appears on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst rush hour pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get status, but Apple has reduced this by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests apps to be uninstalled and then reinstalled when the update is complete.
It’s a good idea to make sure that your phone is charged or near the charger during the update so that you don’t run out of battery.
If the charge level is too low, Apple won't allow the update to progress, as if the battery runs out, it could cause the update to break.

It’s also worth making sure you’ve gone through our list of all the things you need to do before downloading so that things don’t go wrong, and how you can protect yourself if they go. iOS 9 brings new features like a much smarter personal assistant and a huge amount of new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and repair the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has served on the Board of Directors of the tax haven
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, to which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
Berner is still an official member of the Board of Directors, according to the Luxembourg Trade Register.
Berner himself says he has filed a resignation notice for this year in May.
I checked the matter and it is enough that I have submitted a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after fusion
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger at the Board of Directors of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, the ownership of Kährs goes through a multi-tier ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted the board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the board of Karelia-Upofloor owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to take care of the realisation of the capital interests of a Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies’ capital income is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax haven is due to the fact that the capital fund Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
A reception centre maintained by a company opens in Espoo
The first reception centre for adult asylum seekers maintained by the company will open in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants today, starting from 6pm.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service establishes a reception centre on the property of a former rescue institute.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is in particular the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree on security arrangements for the centre, among other things.
STTK prepares an alternative working life tightening package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for tightening the working life of the Board of Directors.
The association also wishes to include other employee centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the current focus is on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative means to reduce the price of work will be returned after that.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out the administration of the organization with a break from the journalists.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) will not be prepared for discussions.
STTK’s economists have calculated that the change security included in the Board’s competitive package costs an estimated EUR 30 million to the employer when the other side of the package is 2,700 million.
I don’t know if a party is terribly keen to have a discussion if there is a relationship of one to a hundred on the same side.
Palola: Negotiation had been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) has requested alternative proposals by Wednesday, as the Government is to issue a notification of its own package to Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take a stand on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the Board of Directors, and it has been constantly constructing him.
According to Palola, surgery of Sunday supplements is a painful place in the field of STTK.
The organisation requires the government to retreat from mandatory legislation to implement part of the tightening process.
According to Palola, STTK does not warm up the fact that the alternative package would be prepared with the SDP that had been on display.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the working life tightening package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, among other things, the salary for the first days of illness is cut, overtime compensation is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75 per cent and holidays are shortened.
STTK emphasises that central organisations have invited employees to participate in the demonstration, and the aim is not to arrange a strike.
Akava Fjäder says
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder, praises STTK’s announcement on preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming to the same lines as Akava, as Akava has already for a long time outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK, the package is not comprehensive enough.
According to SAK led by Lauri Lyly, Akava’s chairman, Sture Fjäder hopes to prepare the performance as an alternative to cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has for a long time been preparing its own proposal to negotiate the five-per-cent competitive leap sought by the country’s government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to see the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks,” says Sture Fjäder, Chairman of the Board.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava’s lines, as STTK has previously done on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers in the country, says Fjäder.
Akava’s Labour Committee will meet at 15 a.m. on Thursday to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
The same boat, common carbon, volunteers" - play bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
Tampere University Green Left
Viva’s bingo ticket for the green left of Tampere University for the evening.
Prime Ministers have previously made exceptional talks during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finnish economy on Yle’s channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
When applying for the corresponding Prime Minister’s previous speech, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he held the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the Mäntsälä revolt.
After that, the President and Ministers held several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held the New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train workers’ strike with a television speech.
Single call, monarchical atmosphere
Sipilä’s speech has raised all day criticism and guesses about what to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could hold her talk about the state of a nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, in which case it would also be possible to discuss the speech."
According to Ville Niinistö from Greens, "single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja from SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist spirit: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to the dialogue: "At least six months of the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with opposition.
The attempted is.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech is pre-recorded and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented by Lauri Lyly, Chairman of SAK, and Jyri Häkämies, CEO of EK.
Yle has been reviewed for presenting Sipilä’s speech.
We considered the matter and found that it was a public service task to promote the comprehensive publicity of Finland as a whole, in the news of Yle’s Director of Publications Ismo Silvo Yle.
Like We at Tammela
Speech has also evoked taunts.
When evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed well in advance, children will be combed and dressed to their best.
Mother puts on the nicest bit, and father arranges a tie around his neck.
At nine o’clock we’ll quiet down to the TV as we used to do at Tammelola,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also tells why there are millionaires who hide their capital in tax havens in the Finnish government, who draw up merciful laws for their other tax evacuators and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut down when the state has run out of money?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
Of what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by Tampere University’s green left Viva.
It has published the bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear in the evening about the same boat, common carbon, debts and team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: The Western countries rejected Russia’s proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by which the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have been given up, says President Martti Ahtisaari to Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan for al-Assad to leave power in style after a while.
However, the Western countries did not adhere to the proposal because they believed al-Assad would fall otherwise in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed him in a one-to-one discussion a three-point plan: the opposition could not be armed, opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately given a speech connection, and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out in a restraint manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not necessarily agree with all things, but we are able to openly discuss them.
I told him what I did there and he said I sat down, Martti, so I tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari recalls in Guardian's interview.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says that he conveyed the message of Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion for the magazine, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the key opposition groups refused all the agreements they would have entered into.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry for Foreign Affairs, is hesitant about Ahtisaari’s speeches, because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss al-Assad’s fate.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s argument is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow’s mandate.
If he had told me about Tsurkin’s speeches, I would have replied that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins argues that he would have suspected that Putin's power would be maintained by some al-Assad supporter.
Refugee Flow Our Actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7 500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of death victims exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes due to war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own works.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the invoice we caused ourselves,” Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Asylum seekers’ organisation centre with squats in Tornio
The asylum seeker organisation centre, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in an empty building of the Tornio Joint Lyceum in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council would already have decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Vice-President of the Tornio City Council, Sauli Hyöppinen (left), it is not true.
When the whole council was not assembled and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting to the first Monday to decide on the matter, he explains to STT.
36 of the 43 delegates were present at the discussion.
The Arrangement Centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
Based on this, the decision could be expected to be positive,” says Hyppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was reacted quickly.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers would be accommodated in the co-operative mixture at a time.
The expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still wishes for an alternative to tightening in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party), halving the public holiday pay would only take care of a part of the calculation of the work price sought by the government.
However, the Government is happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on such.
Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that she was not in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how serious the organisations were looking for replacement measures for the tightening of working life reported by the government.
If such an agreement is formed, we will accept it without any other joy as part of the package.
In Sipilä’s opinion, halving the holiday pay would be a way of working because it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, Sunday supplements planned by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on a cut in holiday pay because they have been registered in collective agreements instead of the law.
In these cases, the Government will report to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a communication to Parliament on Wednesday next week.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work starts then, which means that the train is on the move and it is becoming increasingly difficult.
Now is very time.
For in such matters it is not long before, if there is any will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published last week by the Board of Directors includes, among other things, the conversion of the Epiphany and Hela Thursday into an unpaid holiday without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, salary for the first days of illness is cut, overtime compensation halved, Sunday compensation reduced to 75 per cent and holidays shortened.
The reforms are implemented as mandatory legislation past trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
As a result of the actions, the employee centre organisations organise a major demonstration on Friday, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the storage facility
The Tohmajärvi Council unanimously approved the expansion of the warehouse of Nordic Koivu Oy, a.k.a. the storage facility.
The review was caused by the fact that the project is larger and more expensive than originally had been spoken.
A busy schedule too.
It was also a little wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this point, the expansion of the warehouse with 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in connection with the interim report.
An investment of EUR 150 000-200 000 was still discussed on the agenda, but technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality does not have a risk, as the company pays the investment in rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
Karelian also has a place in Joensuu
The City Board mitigated its steep position in order to bring street name signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in preserving the Karelian tradition throughout the region.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savonia dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian language in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is well-prepared for the use of the Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth considering the use of the Karelian language openly now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still the special characteristics of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the whole forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be used well in the various marketing of the region.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the vitality of the region
The cuts in train connections strike the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the economic life and competitiveness of the region.
And it affects whether you can live and work here in general,” says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also highlights the airport, the continuation of which has also been under consideration several times.
It is important for the entire region that our possibilities cannot be reduced by government measures, as is now underway.
We should look at the effects of the closures of these transport connections on employment, for example,” Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here, such as transport and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Head of Recruitment, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is difficult at the moment, because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside of Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, about 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu became one of the gravel voices for Siun Sote
Joensuu City Board’s view of the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also.
A member of the City Board, Pentti Keskisalo (in the photo of the Finnish National Board of Directors) proposed a relinquishing of the entire project at the Monday meeting, but his proposal fell unprofitable.
The Board of Directors approved the mayor Kari Karjalainen’s decision proposal, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although one train innings less frequently.
Passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will change next March.
One pair of trains will be left off, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to the state’s savings measures.
The purchase of train services by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely discontinued.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27.3.2016.
Boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, guys pegged from the place
The rescue department released a 12-year-old who climbed from the roof and could not get down from the roof with their own help.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki at Ketotie at half-past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no roof ladder at all.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one did not.
The result was that the others were sneaking and the passers-by alerted the rescue department to help the last one left on the roof of the ladder safely back to the ground.
FedEx's operating profit double, lowers the outlook for the tax year 2016
FedEx reports depressing results in the latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast, as a result of lower demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said that it intends to employ about 55 000 seasonal employees for the duration of the holidays.
Last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50 000 seasonal workers for the duration of the holidays.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening clock of Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects to end next May as a result of the tax year at $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were waiting for $10.84, let’s say in FactSet’s survey.
The smaller outlook came, on average, at 4.9% of the price increases that enter into force on 4 January, and despite the higher surcharges that began in November for heavy or large parcel ground transports.
The company said that it expects its operating profit to grow from the previous year, as they have cut costs, net sales have increased, and the online store is growing.
Mr. Fred Smith, Chairman and CEO, said that the company ‘performs steadily, taking into account the weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in production and global trade.’
Plans for wages for the duration of the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS announced that it was going to hire 90-95 000 extra employees, about the same amount as it was hiring last year.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx’s profit was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is $2.44 in the average forecast, and a 12-analyst survey was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In the Zacs survey, six analysts waited $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a reduction in international priority transport, which has halted the development of its Express unit’s net sales.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, the land unit’s net sales increased by 29 per cent, but the income from operations was basically the same due to the costly costs of larger parcels and its own insurance.
The Express unit's revenues were better due to higher base fees, while operating profit in freight operations decreased higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, approximately one hour before the opening clock, FedEx’s shares decreased by $3.85, or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 per cent down for this year and 17 per cent below the 11th of June record.
This week, the decision-makers of the U.S. Central Bank sit around a huge mahogany table at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the key rate for the first time almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank, the two-storey meeting room is a wall mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
Congress has put two types of responsibility on the shoulders of the central bank: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after a major recession, the central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement that is the decisive factor in the Thursday decision, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, that the US economy is ready to be withdrawn from the record-breaking incentive that has brought almost zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
While the majority of data shows a stable economic growth, recent surges in global financial markets may have made the bank officials already on their precautionary path to a more daunting level in terms of increasing instability, and let’s be afraid how to influence the federal funds rate even in the quarter.
Understandably, labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be tracked,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, Principal Financial Specialist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
However, I believe that if they are looking for justification for the non-repayment of interest rates, the increased uncertainty in the world market is still valid enough to wait,” he says.
The central bank’s decision has not reached an agreement, which also gives rise to nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator shows that the possibility of growth is only about 30 per cent.
This refers to a decrease in the securities market if the central bank raises the level unless decision-makers were able to soften the impact by promising that the next withdrawal will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index increased by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 percent, with a new number of 16 599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week,” says John Lonski, Chief Financial Specialist of the Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,” he says.
If decision-makers raise interest rates, “they need to put a lot of effort into supporting the financial markets so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts argue that the elevated level would calm the financial markets, as it would eliminate uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
Just a month ago, the central bank seemed to be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary economy that would secure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the liberals demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1 per cent, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit to full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of pick-up.
While inflation is still below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the central bank’s decision-makers say that this will have a significant temporary impact on the price of lowered oil.
The economy ‘surves even larger interest rates and needs them, taking into account the tight situation in the labour market’, says Ian Shepherdson, Chief Financial Specialist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocked last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index dropped by up to 16 percent from its May record, as investors feared China’s slowdown in global growth as well.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the peak figure in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells us that interest rates should be raised.
Without these financial market events and news in recent weeks about the weakness of China’s economy, decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting,” says Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Scientist at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers are waiting at least a month for a better understanding of the effects.
The potential effects on the US economy are still quite unclear, and they don’t have much of the information at their disposal when it comes to the consequences of Chinese events,” Oliner says.
The well-being of the international economy is not one of the main concerns of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the federal central bank has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the power of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, a suggestion by the then president, Ben S. Bernanken, that the central bank can "decrease" the amount of money, caused upheavals in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Strategy at asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, remarked this month that “the central bank has previously overreacted financial market movements that seemed to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy.”
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions, has demanded an interest rate increase, and Lacker, a member of the Committee entitled to vote, is an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points over the course of three meetings ‘in spite of its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth’, says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank overturned these surgeries.
The central bank should put economic stability first only during a major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Interest Determination Committee.
The latest turmoil does not come close to its level, Posen says.
No one wants to raise interest rates because the market is getting aggravated,” says Posen, Chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still includes a two-fold requirement and does not mention financial stability, as long as this is the case, they should not foresee it.

Brazilian Childhood Organization in Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Diet for Breastfeeders
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts on which depictions of unhealthy food have been painted.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide all the necessary nutrients for babies to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing the amount of calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should undergo.
A recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine from Texas revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from tumor development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Seven-channel Sunrise program is a favorite in viewerships, despite Nine-channel attempts to news directorial revelation in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic's and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to news the aftermath of the Liberal Leader Reveal failed to increase the number of today's viewers.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull threw Tony Abbott out of power.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the week-long series of international broadcasts including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance did not seem to harm Australian TV audiences, as Sunrise's viewer averaged 397 000 in five state capitals, compared to 339 000.
Today’s average rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today’s average was 318 000 and Sunrise’s 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
So far, in September, Sunrise averages 349 000 viewers, compared to 314 000 at Today.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
This morning, the winds will blow beyond Parliament!
Karl and Lisa can well, thank you for asking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800 word series featuring the former star of the Packed to the Rafters series Erik Thomson, an amazing premiere.
The new drama series, which gathered an impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children.
The critics have wondered whether Thomson is the driving force of the popular series alone without the star of Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night gave him real certainty.
Seven-channel The X Factor program was a strong favorite with 1.136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838,000) and TBL Families series (726 000).
The Seven channel had two fates on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
Andrew O’Keefe’s first half-hour (17-17.30) gathered an average of 446 000 viewers.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 spectators - a small enough win from Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat program (613 000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia had a first half-hour viewer average of 520 000 viewers, and in the second half-hour the figure was a staggering 720 000.
The Hot Seat average was 620 000.
The Chase Australia’s second night’s average viewer brings the Nine Channel confidence that the Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce the number of viewers in McGuire's program.

The final trio agrees with fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect type - but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markos accidentally revealed who won the Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman has been kept to the utmost secret, with whom Sam Wood comes together in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls do not really slip who got the last rose.
However, when discussing with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before three became two, they could inadvertently give a clue to the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood’s lips are sealed before Thursday’s final
All three women threw themselves into poetry to tell how Wood is the perfect man to mention his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, to whom should it go?”, their answers could offer a revelation of who won the bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best alternative to Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
From the moment I walked in to the house, (Sarah) the energies and Sami’s energies felt quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series,” said Jeavons-Fellows.
Sarah is really down to earth, it’s fun to be with her,” Marko added.
I have seen them together and there is chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would fit well as a couple.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the right".
When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I’m now with my whole heart here,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not her, Mackay was enigmatic.
I don’t know if I can say,” he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 19.30 a.m. on the Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in its first return when the team won Minnesota on Tuesday 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return the next flight kick and took her into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true character was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of barking his new entrant for a potter in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the post-game press conference.
49ers specialist Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the flight kick that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game
This was not really the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wanted a man for the NFL debut.
Haynen was seen swearing on the way from the field after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio pair Hamish & Andy to the 2DayFM channel at the frequency of 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
It was just one of these things now, you just have to think about the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared fumbling with his 2007 Origin debut when the feed in his own target area led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was still an awesome experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed to her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun, threatening the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 killed when the police fired rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old son, died in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets into a crowd that showed their minds against the new constitutional proposal of the country, the authority said on Wednesday.
Violence took place on a Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the top official in the area, said that more than 1000 demonstrators had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured,” he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets, known to have been killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The confrontation was in the violent protests of the last few weeks across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group demands a state of its own.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central administration for centuries.
The new constitution has been designed since 2008, but the legislators speeded up the process since the devastating earthquake of April killed thousands of people.
This week, the legislators have voted on the constitutional draft clauses in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said that the new charter could be approved by Sunday.
The United States National Hurricane Center NHC says that south of Cape Verde is a 60% chance of a whirlwind
The wide low-pressure front, about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde island group, has a 60% chance to develop into a tropical whirlwind in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
The second high-precision low-pressure front, located between the Cape Verde Island Group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical whirlwind over the next two days, added the weather forecast centre in Miami.
Google launches donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) launched a donation campaign that aims to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have come to Europe while fleeing war tearing and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it posted a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being reported by a director, in his own personal experience, wrote Google employee Rita Masoud, who escaped from Kabul with his family at the age of seven.
Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations are received by four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that it equals to every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugerelief, up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
Europe is undergoing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from its homes this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Slimming surgery can help slightly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of slimming surgery from slightly obese type 2 diabetics can take at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live after weight loss surgery longer than those that are treated in ways other than surgery.
It takes a long time to get the death data,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote the editorial on a new study in the JAMA Surgery journal.
In bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the people involved in the study have been morbidly obese, and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, or weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person’s BMI is more than 30, they are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, type 2 diabetes medical treatments for people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut persons fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI remained roughly the same in 29.
Of the persons cut, 36% of diabetes improved in full and 28% in part.
By comparison, in a medically managed group, diabetes only improved by 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the “bad” LDL cholesterol “was generally better in the surgery group,” the authors stated.
Researchers also monitor patient blood haemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in the long term.
The hemoglobin A1c value should remain below 7 percent, researchers write.
The post-operative hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical care group, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this better glycemic control, described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over a period of five years, says principal investigator Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
For the fifth year, when compared to the gastric reduction surgery group, the gastric bypass surgery group had dropped more weight (18.7 kg and 14.2 kg), decreased its body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased hemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent), and was more likely to achieve a complete diabetes remission (46.9 per cent and 16.7 per cent).
Blackstone at the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that although the study does not show any survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where the surgery led to a longer life for heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obesity patients under weight loss surgery had a 29 per cent lower probability of dying over a 15-year period compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are still encouraging for individuals with less than 35 BMIs interested in surgery.
The results of the study are crucial precisely in that they show that surgery is safe for a lower body mass index group,” he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
I think we’ll wait too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare their body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has demanded the elimination of violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day UK visit, dedicated to ethics research.
Dalai Lama argued that, in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also inadequate.
Not everyone can come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, she stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
It’s great to take care of several thousands of refugees, but in the meantime, you have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
While taking a stand on the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the US’ violent response caused the chain’s violent events.
After 9/11- Isku, I presented my participation in the letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it created unexpected consequences,” said Dalai Lama.
Over the past four years, children’s hand sanitiser has become four times more swallowed
Poison Information Centres across the United States have reported a nearly 400% increase in swallowing alcohol-containing hand disinfectant for children under 12 years of age since 2010, says the Georgian Poison Information Centre.
According to the director of the Georgian Poison Information Centre, Doctor Gaylord Lopez, the cases of disinfectant swallowing in children under 12 years of age reported in poison centres rose from the case of 3266 in 2010 to the case of 16117 in 2014.
Children are interested in these products more often and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will come to the emergency clinic,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while others want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge on social media.
On YouTube, there are videos where teens drink disinfectant to get a cheap bullshit.
According to the reports, teens have mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
The pleasant scents of disinfectant can attract younger children.
The child doesn’t think that this is bad to him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand sanitizers) are those with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant can contain any alcohol between 45% and 95%.
Especially for small children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
It’s really condensed alcohol,” said Stephen Thornton, Medical Director of the University of Kansas Medical Center for Poison Information, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn’t leave a whiskey shot lying on the table, but hand sanitizer is left visible, and if children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four syringes of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school and was taken to first aid treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit of adult drunk driving, says First Aid Clinician Chris Ritchey, who took care of the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah quenched as he spoke and could not walk when he arrived at the first aid.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and beat her head, Ritchey said.
It was really scary,” the mother of Nhajah, Ortoria Scott, said to CNN.
The situation could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and move the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three four-graders planned to poison their “insane” teacher by spreading bacterial poison to the classroom, says the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned from its class.
The police consider the deterrent plan to be a ‘mute fool’ and leave disciplinary measures to the school district.

Lack of Scottish Championship saturates Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for championships with Rangers.
Ajax’s current ambassador, de Boer, said: “The Netherlands no longer shows the highlights of Celtic games and why?”
Because Rangers is not included.
People here don’t just have the time to talk about Rangers’ return.
They talk about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and they are interested in that.
There are a lot of tensions in the games of these teams, and also non-Scottish ones want to follow those games.
Deila swears to turn around the situation
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn around the situation.
Lose to Malmö and the resulting drop from the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss to Aberdeen who played with ten men, which is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
However, Deila said: “Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again.”
Now we just want to out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
So we are, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves player performance.
Now it is important to stay together.
Warburton is on guard of January player transfers
While Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible January player moves, he is on guard against a recruitment frenzy, confirming that he does not want to mix the team's unanimity.
The former Brentford boss said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment time is the whole time before, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic’s interest Michu hints at retirement
The Swansea striker, Michu, whose name was associated with the transfer window to Celtic, has hinted that he could retire after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and was unable to find a new club outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Association for Neilson’s comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2, the defender's red card was subsequently revoked, which was already the third red card condemned by the Collum during the last eight months.
Neilson stays behind his message, saying, “I didn’t question honesty, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting an insulting song from former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
It was derby and it was a whim for a moment,” the attacker added, “It’s safe to say I won’t return to Tynecastle unless I’m going to play Celtic.”
Tannadice's Board of Directors believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly argues that Dundee United’s government still has faith in the management team’s ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We’ll get the boys right again,” Donnelly says.
McInnes happy about the “ugly win” in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to win his seventh consecutive league win thanks to Adam Rooney's first half penalty, which raised them to the top of the table five points above Celtics.
McInnes says: “There is no team that would have won anything, be it a trophy or league that would not also have won games like this.”
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the UK’s integer grows
Unemployment in Scotland remained in 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK rose to 1.82 million.
Scotland’s unemployment rate is 5.9 per cent higher than that of the UK’s 5.5 per cent, the figures of the National Statistics Finland (ONS) indicate.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period, and the number of employees is now 2 612 000.
During the quarter, Scotland’s employment rate decreased to 74 per cent, which is higher than the UK’s average of 73.5 per cent.
David Mundell, State Secretary of Scotland, comments on these latest figures: “The Government’s long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a genuine decision to remain part of the UK.
During these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has decreased.
Why I witness execution in Oklahoma
If no legal intervention takes place, later today I will see when the man is executed.
If so, and I hope that no, I sit on the viewers’ magazines in Oklahoma State Penitentiary to watch while Richard Glossip is executed with deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was upset, I agreed.
I have started to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of death punishment.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, have the opportunity to follow the executions in America, and since there are often more than free positions, participants are selected through a creepy draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media to twelve to five.
Anyone who is chosen will watch the event as cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have also created my own connection to him through calls made during the months, as well as a two and a half hour visit.
I like a man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I must not have a notebook and a pen with me to save what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from oklahoma blamed on Twitter that I have compromised on my neutrality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner the way he wants, and you will be able to participate.
I complained to the supplier.
He admitted that “he could have put his words better,” but still thinks that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t even say that.
I have told him that he can at any time remove me from the list of witnesses.
But he wants there is an international journalist who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post Reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to the podcasts I have made in the series.
I will not go through all the details again here.
I can’t say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would in any case make him guilty of assistance.
But I believe that there is a very strong chance that he has not committed murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence justifying death punishment.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And then this is the point of view from which I look at him dying.
I can’t claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other suppliers on site who will take care of it.
I give you a description of how it feels to look when the man I like dies unnecessarily.
Man lured away from the Canning River after a watery police yacht
The Canning Vale constable remained dry as he lured the man away from the Canning River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to deceive the police from their point of view went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just meters from the policeman who tried to “give him gently back to the beach”.
The Canning Valen police were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday due to unauthorized intrusion.
When they spotted a suspect, this tried to deceive them by heading to the Canning River.
But he couldn’t get too far.
He stood in the water saying ‘I won’t come away, come and pick me up’, said Senior Officer Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhevec did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used safer tactics: “good police negotiations”.
Sometimes people do funny things while trying to escape,” said Senior Officer Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his company, but inspired the locals to start the playful design of the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the officials tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victorian officials tried to infiltrate his stalls last year and threatened to stop competing immediately.
He accuses the officials and the Racing Victorian Bribery Section, claiming that they have a personal campaign going against him, and on Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to the treatment on race day was the last rivet.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has found himself in a difficult situation after Lidar’s inexplicable positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check with spy claims for a year and a half, and he didn’t want it to look like jealousy.
I wasn’t going to say anything about this, and for a long time I’ve been silent about it, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything will be unraveled at once,” said Moody.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with penalties, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home today and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk the head upright and I want the owners to think that I will do my best to them.
When they start thinking differently, then I should no longer continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview on racing.com, where he told him that the bribery department had tried to spy on his stable.
A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man - I name him when asked - and offered him a job in my stables if he cares about what I do there.
They clearly consider me a cheat.
If so, they should separate their lawyers, for they have failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all clear at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is going to be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to occupy itself and maybe transfer responsibility to other than coaches for what’s going on in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I don’t doubt that now things might make them think of it.
But I am now at the point that I care no more, and it grieves me.
It really grieves me.
I pressure them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has increased with the long-term Lidar Cobalt Survey, and late rejection led him to say that “to throw his license over the table”.
Moody, best known for coaching the invincible champion Black Caviar, has called the rules for racing day care ‘laughter’ after a mud or clay bath is placed on the horse’s feet, which is irregular.
It’s against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
One of my employees put mud on its feet in error.
It could have had a bath last night.
It might have been yesterday, as it was.
It had it on race day.
Moody may have a three-month ban on competition due to the day of the game, from which the officials started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who draw up these rules do not know anything about the horse.
We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
In Cobra, a driver who has been forced to drive
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic escape after colliding with a cyclist on a weekend in Cobra.
The biker was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after receiving serious injuries when the car crashed into him on Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police reported that the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia signed up to the police himself at Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, neglecting assistance and other traffic violations.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobramis, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Team Coach Craig Bellamy Attacks Rivals in Wrestling Claims
Melbourne Storm’s coach Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL rugby league champions’ claims that his team’s tackling would be part of the “alignment”.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed Storm to ‘wrestle’ on their side as it unexpectedly won the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
The Brisbane Broncos coach, Wayne Bennett, was barely able to cover his reference to Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys in the finals on Saturday evening, and Bennett called the game the rugby league’s “show window” and said two Queensland teams weren’t “very excited” to wrestle.
Bellamy defended the tacks of her team and said they just focused on “contact” when tackling.
Bellamy added that her trust was increased by the criticism of two leading coaches for Storm, which means that they are afraid of losing to the team.
This always comes up - I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defense systems or techniques throughout the year, and over the past six weeks we have only stressed contact with tackles and it has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years and has obviously a great team to coach, so he is probably not used to losing, and this was a small shock to him.
Funny how this will always be talked about at this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett’s idea of “exciting rugby” by reminding her mentor that Bennett’s coach St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing “thumbly”.
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team capable of playing rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young guys.
You want to play such a game when you have players of its type.
He brought that side out 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby in his style - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt in order to play so.
I will be more confident when they say such things because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think of us as opposed to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more stingy than played between Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense and not paint it?
For me, this is all about policies.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks for the next Saturday night’s pre-final at AAMI Park, and the tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serbianman's 200 000-dollar guarantees for drug accusation
A man who threatens a potential life cycle from a 40-cocaine smuggled holding attempt in Queensland is exempted from a deposit amount of $ 200 000.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of the five men who was arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilograms of drug to the Solay yacht who came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other accused people at the marina throughout the morning, and then met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of drug in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic threatens a potential lifelong cocaine holding attempt, his lawyer argued that there was no evidence that Maximovic attempted to hold the entire amount, and that he could be in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
He has fixed connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In a case by the Criminal Court, Maximovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together had offered a deposit of $200K to ensure his release.
Having read both people’s sworn certificates, it’s clear that setting a deposit of $200K is a real financial burden for them,” said Judge Flanagan.
But alone it was not enough to prevent him from appearing before justice, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on the condition that he hands over both his Australian and Serbian passports, registers daily with the police and maintains his ban on outdoor activities between the six and the six.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the 11-year-old girl’s phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while the girl was sleeping and then logged in to the online communication service, where Hogg received numerous obscene pictures of the children he was sent by another user.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was lost and found it sleeping on Hogg's hand.
The girl examined her phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
When the police arrived, they saw five images, examined the computers on the site and found “confusing” online searches with search terms used to search for obscene images taken from children.
After that, Hogg claimed to the police that he had done this to “attract pedophiles” on the internet before “representing himself as a policeman to scare them.”
Eilidh Robertson, representative of the Fiscal depute, said to the Sheriff Court in Dundee: “He said that it is an addiction - that he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had completed searches on the computer but said they had been made just because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman in order to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with a stranger who sent him pictures, as well as when Hogg asked him to send additional pictures.
Hogg said that he did this only for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking, it is sick and wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she screamed at her mother, shook and wept.
The mother saw the obscene pictures on the phone and then encountered the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she told him that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
On June 14, Hogg, 23 years old at Ward Road in Dundee, convicted of prosecuting or taking photos of impious children, broke his guarantees on January 25 of this year and failed to come to court on March 24 of this year.
Defensive attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hoggia not be entered in the register of sexual offenders, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a ‘significant sexual element’.
Seriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the judgment to October so that the social services have time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was given guarantees in this article, but in other ongoing cases he is arrested before processing.
He was added to the register of sexual offenders before the judgment date.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest leader of Africa, Mugabe, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the speaker platform.
He did not hurt, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The Parliament's openings were also stained by opposition legislators' claims that they had been sent anonymous kill threats, in which they were warned not to buoy to Mugabelle during his speech.
Last month, they broke up and interrupted him with interlocutions as he spoke about the state of the country to the Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
The number from which the message was sent does not respond, but the subject of the message is ‘death’,” Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe’s speech.
The message warned the relevant members that integrity will end in the Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary integrity will not apply.
The group discipline supervisor said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is “ Worried” about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the business.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from faster-growing business hardware and service operations.
Expected job cuts bring about $2.7 billion in costs starting from quarter to quarter, HP’s release said.
These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the division.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move into a new business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual net sales will be over $50 billion, and it will “focus on delivering unmatched integrated technology solutions” to companies,” says the company’s press release.
The division breaks down the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, from Stanford University, founded in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies, operating in a garage in Palo Alto, called the “born of Silicon Valley”.
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the US, and its distribution is the latest in the industry based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates need to support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now and assuming that he will be rehabilitated according to plan, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next English games, and considering his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in next summer’s European Championships.
The biggest pity in this latest problem is that the end of Wilshere last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the start of the season.
This kind of injury does not threaten your career,” Wenger said.
It is a bone that did not cure properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It is not related to his ankles or previous injuries that he has had.
This can be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, when the player tries to return through the middle, there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model in the formation.
Premier Injuries Ltd’s studies show that Wilshe has had 23 injuries since she debuted six years ago.
In addition, over the last five seasons, he has played Arsenal’s 157 league games in just 65 games.
Looking at Arsenal’s wider set since the 2007-08 season, in six seasons it has been one of the two Premier League teams who lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their improvement in disability statistics last season will continue.
Sometimes when you recover from an injury, you may be exposed to a period when you need to strengthen your body and get competition,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will have such a career as he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team as Arsenal starts their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday at Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
I’m trying to maintain balance and give a rest to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up favourite in Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 matches since they produced their own campaign of “Invincible” last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was shaken by an earthquake, which was 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has mastered the Champions League against Monaco in the last season, and is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European cup victory.
This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is eye-catching how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to tackle the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced a year for men in 2015 with the aim of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the core of meeting this challenge.
The recent study involved more than 2000 secondary school and high school-age students who showed symptoms of depression, and according to the study, the person’s ability to recover doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his friends were “healthy mind”.
Similarly, those who were not depressed, the probability of the emergence of potential mental health problems was halved if they had healthy friends in their minds.
But in order for a friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this social media communication period, the style goes past the content and the response immediacy is often more important than contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, happy and successful, although in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status, all this happens to internal values - internal longing for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, there really is no greater happiness for money.
The fineness of the frends was that it turned this focus on its head.
No character defined their work, but rather their personality, which clearly stood out in interaction as friends.
Joey’s and Chandler’s numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel – their humor came from knowing that yes, men can relate to all of this, although they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As the volunteer of the Samaritans organization explained to me: “When listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how the slightest interaction with a friend can improve the feeling.”
Men who often contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of “overcoming” is strong, as is the feeling that if problems open up, is seen as weak.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term survival methods.
It emphasized the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my unbiased, external position at the other end of the phone helps people in times of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
So, if you take part in the FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate the celebration, why not take your friends to the Central Per.
Or, even better, if you see someone lonely in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, take part in #FriendsFest
Di Maria paints and helps PSG to slapp Malmö to the side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored the Champions League in her debut, helping PSG overtake the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the Champions League in her debut less than four minutes, pointing to the French League champions on the road, but the team lost several chances before finally increasing their lead as Cavan hit the finish line in the 61st minute.
Paris, who is in the same group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a sequel to the game, but also an improvement in their quarter finals in the last three rounds
But while PSG took the score, it wasn’t a classic game, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost a spot in front of the goal and later changed from the field, Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his great career in 1999.
In the Champions League, it’s not easy to win at home or at guests, so the 2-0 win produces problems for the opponent and looks good in the statistics, and it’s a good start, even though there are things that we have to sand this season,” Blanc said.
This predicts good.
We wanted to win and won, even though I’m sorry we didn’t manage to score one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team in one of the three changes made after the team reached 2-2 draws in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but he remained in the shadow of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinian winger was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when Marco Verratt ran behind Malmö’s defense line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland in the back corner of the network.
However, if someone was expecting an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a clogged opponent and won Celtic in a settlement match when it reached this level, with nine international players in the opening field and a five-man defence, as well as two players in the deep midfield.
But on the attack side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which passed by a button from Kevin Trapp's goal post.
In contrast, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to lost feeds and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in all five companies in the first half alone, and after that, Cavani put the ball in from the touch of Ibrahimovic right at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in pre-working his colleagues, and it was from the infeed of Ibrahimovic that Di Maria sent a spiral kick that tilted around Wiland’s goal post at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored one hour after the sixth goal was scored by Uruguayan Cavan after Ibrahimovic had clicked on Maxwell's crossfeed from the left.
Malmö’s hopes of getting back to the game ended, and only Wiland’s brilliant fight against David Luiz’s direct kick kept the ending numbers down before the Ezequiel Lavezz’s goal of the change was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team, saying: “Our most recent Champions League game was last year in December.”
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I'll take my hat to Paris.
This was an awesome game from them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share sales
The mining industry in Switzerland left Glencore, who suffered from the price breakdown of basic commodities, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in the communication that it had sold new shares for about £1.6 billion to shorten its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, struggles with the prices of the collapsed basic commodities, when the slowdown in China’s economy is burdening demand and causes destruction in all markets.
The new subscription increased the value of Glencore shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange in the morning trades of Wednesday.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 penny in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had revealed $2.5 billion in the previous week as part of its broader plan to cut its debt burden of $30 billion by about a third.
The company sold a new share capital by 125 penny shares, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on the closing price of Tuesday.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, the total value of which was 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about the long-term halt of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, and at the same time coal, copper and other commodities prices have decreased by 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping makes a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the statement published on Tuesday in the White House was confirmed.
Xi’s first official visit to Washington takes place on September 25 and is the answer to President Barack Obama’s last November visit to Beijing, the statement said.
U.S. President and President’s spouse Michelle Obama will arrange a dinner for X and his spouse Peng Liyuan after the executives have held bilateral negotiations.
A visit to President Xi gives us the opportunity to expand the cooperation between the United States and China in a number of global, regional and bilateral issues that share a common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively discuss issues with disagreements,” the statement added.
The visit, which was first announced in February, is also expected to deviate from Seattle on his way to Washington, D.C. before he continues towards New York City and the UN September General Assembly.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington’s concern about China’s alleged cyber espionage and the country’s increased absoluteness in the controversial waters of the South Chinese Sea.
Matt Damon underestimates diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon teamed up with Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown to discuss a difference that Damon says isn’t needed behind the scenes.
In HBO’s Sunday evening episode of Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown as he emphasized the need for different perspectives on the dark protagonist of the selected manuscript.
When we talk about diversity, it is taken into account when choosing actors for the film, not for the series,” Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacts unbelievingly, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay" while The Martian's actor's comments were hanging out.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
I want to encourage people to think, any director is how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is the whore that his white pimp beats.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the rights of film directors to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon tediously replied that their direction “can end up giving us something we don’t want.”
After the discussion had been sent, social media exploded to disapprove the comments of Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip, saying: “Matt Damon talking over the only dark-skinned person in the room and explaining to him the difference is so white that it hurts.”
After its release, Tweet collected over 5000 retweets and 4000 likes.
Damon’s comments hit a time when an accurate racial performance in the media is in the foreground of social debate.
After the Caucasian police killed teenager Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to end the discriminatory practices of colored people.
In February, singer Prince motioned as the nominees for the Album of the Year for the Grammy Award.
Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black life, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter recently published a statement to answer Fox News’ TV face Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question of whether a group should be considered a hate group.
The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
It was recently told that Damon was included in it among entertainers, producers, and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the west.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met with the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
A professional rock climber and container catcher, Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and was rewarded with a million dollar main prize.
The competition programme that ended its seventh season has never been a competitor that would have survived all the sections of the programme’s obstacle course.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and the cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last task had to be climbed about 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten first climbed and investigated the challenge on time, making him the first ever athlete to clear the exhausting 4th leg of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a hard win and was still shocked by winning the $1 million main prize.
So it’s great to think about this when I’ve never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big salary increase.
So suddenly... I can’t even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
Production manager Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten won't get more commission money, although he's the first ever racer to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
If more than one person permeates, the money gets the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, she still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don’t think he feels resentful because of that.
She is just so happy that she got what she did.
His fans have praised him.
He is a great guy and a good family father.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If someone had to win me, I’m happy that it was Isaac.”
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if he had gone the other way around.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, the filming of which will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaked past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--One half of the season hasn't been very fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers were sometimes one of the best baseball teams, but is now in the last American League Central division.
Tigers played the role of the spoiler perfectly on Tuesday when it defeated Minnesota Twins in the 5-4 Target Field.
The Twins lost the chance to rise to halfway from Houston Astros in another American League Wild card slot.
For Detroit, the game was a return for at least one evening to the six-letter word H, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the second half of the season.
All wins are fun, no matter how they are made,” said Brad Ausmus, Tigers Team Leader.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two innings, and then once again in the sixth and ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 innings and released three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
I just want a strong ending for this year,” Simon said.
It is difficult for the exchanger to enter each game, and that is why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' substitute, Victor Martinez, hit three times and made it possible for two races, which were his first beats after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-beat night after he hit four times against Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
He waved the club well,” Ausmus said.
He looked great (in swing exercises), looked much better in swing exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and it was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting twice out on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks landed on the right side with a single hive, and Simon was able to burn the second hive player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to the left-handed Blaine Hard.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against him, ahead of the novice substitute, Miguel Sano, who dragged the two nests to the left of the right-handed Drew VerHage.
With two runners on the pitch and a leveling runner in the 2nd nest, VerHagen scored a third nest in Trevor Plouffe's double-spinning goal.
It was a record in the main series: 27 times this season, when Plouffe hit the double game.
After Detroit had finished the reconnaissance run at the start of the ninth, Mauer dragged two beaten runs against Tigers' closure Bruce Rondo, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned I say in three passes in his fifth rescue.
In the beginning, Detroit took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers had three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got out of the injured list before the game after having been off for inflammation of the lower back of more than a month.
It’s obvious that I didn’t want such a start,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable and felt that I had a few nice feeds in my third innings.”
After Hughes grabbed the starter to the first hive, he allowed the second hive player Ian Kinsler to advance one way.
On the right hand side, the walking of J.D. Martinez in the event of two fires brought Victor Martinez to the beat, who took himself to the first nest by midfield punch and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 streak while runners were in a good running position.
Third-case player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing another run, but the threat ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned as he attempted to advance to the third-case.
Tigers continued in the second inning and got one fire, two nests running from kidnapper James McCann and two fires, one nest running from center Anthony Gose, after which the situation was 3-0.
It was an important hit,” said Twins Team Leader Paul Molitor.
He didn’t hit very well, but it flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be infeed and fed the third inning without running, after which he was replaced by the right-handed successor, A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs from six strokes and a walk with four fires.
ATTENTION: Tigers' right-handed pitcher, Anibal Sanchez, was removed due to a strain on the shoulder of the throwing hand.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured since mid-August due to shoulder strain, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris's statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was exchanged for him on July 30th.
Norris has been out since August 20 because of a strain on the right abdominal muscles.
The Tigers and Twins series of three games ends on Wednesday in Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) stands against Ervi Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA), the right-handed pitcher of Minnesota.
Xi calls for a wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy must open more to the outside world to promote growth,” President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group whose task is to guide the reform.
China should commit to attract foreign funding and expertise and develop transparency policies,” he said, as he spoke at the 16th meeting of the leading group to deepen the general reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as the reforms are driving more movement and vitality, as well as creating new space for economic growth,” Xi said.
The Management Team approved a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting access to the market, a loosening of border control principles, an invitation to private capital owned by state-owned companies, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list is created that identifies the sectors and companies that are not allowed to be invested in.
The system is gradually tested and improved with the help of trial programs.
The change is significant, as it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, the statement states.
The Board of Directors also loosens its control over the power it shares with companies, ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business.
The statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors will open up for private funding in order to open up state-controlled sectors.
The Government does not change its policy on foreign investments, and it will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent residence permits for foreign nationals, “green cards”, is facilitated by optimizing the requirements and lightening the application process.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the professional rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
Li Keqiang, Prime Minister, and Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, Senior Vice Presidents, were also included in the statement published after the meeting.
