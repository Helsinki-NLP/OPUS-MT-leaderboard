Kuopio and Juankoski decide separately to carry out the next municipal elections.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After joining Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is about 111,000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed Kiev’s leadership on Monday for refusing direct political discussions with the Separatists of Eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct an essential political debate with the eastern part of their country,” Putin said, according to news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, who Kiev and the West said were assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian forces further away from their current positions, where Putin said that Ukrainian army troops were shooting civilians.
The aim of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the inhabitants of the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
It surprised us that the group was already coming in early evening.
There were visitors in two days as expected, says the promoter Tom Kangas.
Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be hip hop festivals, that is, pop is not coming, Kangas convinces.
On Tuesday, Finland enters into force a law restricting the acquisition of substances suitable for the production of explosives.
In the future, private individuals must apply for permission from the National Police Board to purchase or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as a source of explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, as well as mixtures containing them, if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is found in cleaning and detergents, for example, but concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration driving.
However, source materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of Nairn and Pitlochry's hotel rapes
A trial awaits the accused of rape in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing before the High Court of Glasgow.
He is accused of rape at Pitlochry Scotland’s Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman when she “is in an unconscious state, sleeping, and unable to make a decision for herself”.
Webster is also accused of another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Upper Uplands, 4 May 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the court is held in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Premier League: Super Raheem shone - Mario was overshadowed - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling showed again why he is considered the hope of the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday, when Liverpool, who had strengthened at Mario Balotel, arrived as Tottenham's guest.
Super Marion’s debut was promising: experienced English journalists saw 24-year-old Italian work in the field with a completely different attitude than Manchester City.
The Balotel was still far from its peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality finishers and fed only half of its sixteen passes to its own team.
Pool fans who have already been popular with the player will expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotel in the role of Luis Suarez as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As a star of the team, instead of Balotel, the middle-field diamond's top Raheem Sterling was sparkled by Hugo Lloris, who beat the 3-0 victory over the important opening goal.
Sterling, 19, not only shines with its power.
Shorter than 20 centimetres, the English is between the lines of the opponent than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common to a player who speeds up the grass for about 34 kilometres per hour.
Rodgers also deserves great praise for the development of Sterling.
After the match, the North Irishman explained how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player than the North-West Londoner at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am glad and proud"
The City Board of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra since autumn 2016.
Journals, including Los Angeles Times, have asked what orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she starts in her new position with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a key role in Finland’s music life for over a hundred years, for example by performing a large number of Sibelius’s music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have previously worked with many orchestral members.
I am looking forward to our future cooperation," he says.
Employee organisations' administrations in pension negotiation - Homeland - News - Karjalainen

The administrations of the employee organisations SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiation situation in the morning.
After that, the intention is to continue the actual pension negotiations.
Labour market organisations have, among other things, rubbed a dispute about the binding of retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would be created during this week.
Pihtipudas.
Rovaniemi-based women’s volleyball league team Woman Volley stumbled over the league climber Vampulan Athletes at the final of the training tournament in Pihtipudas on Sunday.
Vampula turned five of the stretched matches into 3-2 wins.
The last batch of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead all the time.
The battle was good, but in the defense game and passport game, Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo’s coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's spruce was awkward thing that the 190-centimetre American centener Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the back.
Sara Niemi played as the center.
Despite his thumb injury, Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play and formed the most fiery combination of WoVo with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 batches.
The best part of Vampula was the skillful Russian passer and the libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparation for the league will continue next week when Hämeenlinnan HPK comes to training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday with a "trader" at 18 o'clock in the official training game.
On Sunday, you will meet at the sports college for a second time.

More frequent deaths of ovarian cancer in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and inconvenient access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video to honor her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural areas in Australia have a higher risk of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers went through more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, i.e. more than five years after the diagnosis.
Principal investigator Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers went through women’s health history for seven years.
According to Dr Susan Jordan, the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socioeconomic status also affected the possibility of survival.
The probability of survival was the lowest when older women and cancer spread to a wider extent during the diagnosis.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study does not seek to find out why women living outside cities have a lower chance of coping with ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers it possible to have delayed diagnosis and troubled access to treatment.
Gynecological oncology specialists are best treated by this disease, and their appointments are mostly located in large cities,” Jordan says.
Although remote services are becoming more common and the importance of distance is reduced, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programs that support patients from far away from home.
According to Dr. Jordan, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, which emphasizes the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
Elisha Neave, a family mother living in the 33-year-old Gold Coast in March 2012, found malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen snowmobile parking in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the town plan proposal for the Friendship Park and its surroundings will be made publicly available to the public at the service point Osviitta.
Statements on the plan proposal are requested from the Environmental Board and the Lapland Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment.
With the help of the town plan change, the city wants to enable the continuation of tourism-related snowmobiling activities in the area.
The aim is to form a park area that includes the area between the current Friendship Park and its river.
According to the proposal, no more than 200 snowmobiles will be available permanently between November 15 and April 30.
Refuelling points may also be placed in the area for a specified part.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area for safari companies for snowmobiling in the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid in spring 2018.
Snowmobile parking and plan change have raised even loud resistance.
The residents of neighboring apartment buildings have been busy with both sound and worry about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been studied, and no observations have been made that exceed the guidelines.
The renewed equipment is also lower than the old one.
The Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were moved further away, the hotel’s safari customers should take buses to the starting points of the safaris, which would be estimated to be 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and surroundings of the Friendship Park are also large enough for snowmobiles, better than those proposed as replacement starting points, such as next to the boat dock on the eastern side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The Friendship Park is also good for its location because the activities can expand in the future, for example, to the Ounaspaviljonki area.
Establishing parking operations is part of the City Strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the City’s objective is, among other things, to create a good setting for business operations by reserving enough high-quality areas in logistically and functionally inexpensive locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre’s partial master plan, which has not yet gained legal force.
The decline in owner-occupied housing is visible in garden stores
The decrease in the number of homeowners, especially in a group of 35-year-olds, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of gardening shops by tens of millions, as today’s young consumers reach the “main target group” of garden sales on behalf of their age.
According to the Financial Times report, homeowners spend only 55% of the amount of money spent by homeowners on gardening.
The study also revealed that more and more people are living in highly urbanized apartments with no gardens, and that the size of the garden is also reduced as the front yard is increasingly paved into parking spaces. These factors also threaten the garden sector, which is estimated to be around £5 billion per year.
In the large London area, ownership of housing has decreased from 61% to 43% in six years, and it uses the least money per household in the whole country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), the increase in housing rentals or the reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS’s leading garden adviser, says that ‘plants grown in mobile containers, for example, are particularly popular among homeowners because such growers can be included in the change if necessary’.
According to the HTA report, the years 1997–2005 were the boom of resale in the garden sector, as ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid 90s.
The report also predicts that this year’s trade activity will be brisk due to better weather conditions, after last year’s March and April weather was worse.
Turkey interrogates US diplomat for spy report
The Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs has invited the most experienced U.S. diplomat in the country to provide a report on spying by Americans and British in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. Embassy Attorney General and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept have written that the documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was the main spying object of U.S. and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the significance of the report, saying that all the major states have spyed on each other.
The earlier report on the spying against Ankara by Germany’s main intelligence service resulted in a more angry reaction to the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in new Finnish film

Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen in the film 2 nights in the morning, the filming of which will start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Best Actress in the Cannes Film Festival for his role as the Barbarian Invasion in 2003.
He has performed in Steven Spielberg’s film Munich and Julian Schnabel’s film Butterfly in a glass dome.
Mikko Nousiainen plays the lead role in the 2 nights morning film.
The film premieres in Finland in September 2015.
Mallorcan Magaluf Chief of Police accused of corruption
The case was revealed by evidence from the police and government officials of Calvià on Friday at the Office of the General Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The Chief of Police of Calvià on the island of Mallorca has been arrested as a result of corruption accusations by business and bartenders in the Magaluf region, known for its humid celebration.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was put in detention after several business owners on Punta Ballena were prosecuting corruption against him, most of the bars and nightclubs on Punta Ballena.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, evidence was provided by the police and the public officials of Calvià on Friday at the Office of the Public Prosecutor against the Corruption of Mallorca.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police in connection with corruption charges, and they are interrogated by the judge together with Navarro.
The daily magazine ABC, published throughout the country, wrote that nightclub owners were angry about the bias of the authorities, which significantly complicated their business.
It’s no longer money, it’s coping,” a business owner said to the court.
You will not destroy our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries magazine titles this summer, when an online YouTube video in which an 18-year-old British vacationer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island’s authorities have tried to curb the intoxicated and uncontrolled use of Magaluf’s holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the nightclub owner and pub crawl organizer Carnage were jointly ordered to pay a fine of EUR 55 000.
Above all, among young British tourists, the popular tourist resort of Magaluf has also become a recommendation for the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents caused by the use of alcohol when people have jumped from the balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel’s swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while rockets and grenade launchers bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli and Hamas War and the schools remained closed as the area recovered from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the Southern Israeli communities bombed by rockets, but the traces of battles are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod in the south, in the Pashosh nursery, the workers removed the traces of fragments from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket hit the kindergarten.
We’re a little scared but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbut called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area are desperately in need of routines.
Bart’s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks the return to school after a long time feels “a little strange”.
We have sometimes had difficult times when we didn’t leave home anywhere,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbut near the Gaza Strip for his support.
Before the start of the last week’s ceasefire, thousands of residents of the frontier communities like Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are doubtful about the return after the Palestinian grenade has killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families are so far placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited the school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza Strip, which was subject to a heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study diligently and promised that “children’s education and safety will be taken care of”.
Israel and Hamas agree on a ceasefire for the time being last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas’ demand for Israel and Egypt’s blockade and the reopening of Gaza’s air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who fell during the war.
In Egypt, the start of a new round of indirect negotiations is expected later this month.
According to estimates by Palestine and the UN, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, albeit not holding evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the side of Israel, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers shot 4 591 rockets and grenade in battles in the Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, carried out more than 5 000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to shelter at more than 100 UN-hosted schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still sheltered, and as the battles continued, the school authorities postponed the beginning of the school in the previous week.
I hope that the school will open soon and we will be back to school, just like the other children in the world and just like the Jewish children,” said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a school in Gaza.
According to a commonly used indicator, housing prices have risen most in seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing units, which measures the prices of the Australian capital, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, was disclosed in the data of RP on Monday.
As a result of the increase in prices for June, July and August, the total increase was 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen evenly across the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin’s housing market are next busiest; the average price rise is five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring in Australia will increase the number of apartments on sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
Considering the rise in the sales of dwellings to be auctioned, the overall high sales rate and the continuing low interest rate level, it is likely that the prices of dwellings will continue to rise over the next three months,” Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has led record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and art have attracted record-breaking audiences this summer to Mänttä.
More than 70 000 guests have visited the Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and features pop art classics from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä’s art weeks again reported that they had made a visitor record on Monday, when 14 500 people had visited the Hetkinen event this summer.
Such figures have not been accustomed to.
People have been scrambling from doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums this year will be approaching one hundred thousand.
In previous years, there have been about 40 000 visitors.
Located between Tampere and Jyväskylä, Mänttä-Vilppula has about 11 000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen points out that new museums are always when they open up phenomena.
The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season will continue over the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
The police investigate four thefts made last few days in Kajaani.
On Sunday evening, a window broke into a commercial property on Pohjolankatu.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, a truck of fuel was stolen from the tank on Syväojankatu.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday, the boat and its outboard engines had been taken out of the marina of Petäjäisenniska.
The rowing boat was a Kalapalta-character from the outside light and yellowish inside.
On the inner side, the text "OIVA" was read on the front side.
A couple of suspects had time to catch the police.
On Sunday evening, a break in the commercial property was made up on Tikkapurontie.
The police dog was left behind and a twenty-year-old paltaman was found hiding in the forest under the spruce.
On Monday, the police took another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Lost amphetamine brought murder accusation in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamine prosecuted the Kajaani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his common-law spouse and another man and shot a person who was suspected of being a drug exporter, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman.
The defendant denied the accusation and claimed that the other man was the shooter.
The incident became known to the police when the police patrol stopped the passenger car, where the party was burning clothes used in bloodwork.
In addition to the fired clothes traps, a cracked shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will give a judgment later in the case.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, on average one warm August is repeated once every ten years.
It is clear from the statistics of the Finnish Meteorological Institute that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was from one to two degrees.
Due to the heat in July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me
Henry was born to a family of seven immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley, United Kingdom, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when he was 19 years old, and the relationship between the son and father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy’s Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on his father’s imaginary conversation and developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap at the upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has often been in therapy since his mother died, and he thinks a lot about his relationship with his father.
Father was very difficult to read.
His face never appeared, only a voice said: Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Go!
I look at the cricket now.
My parents, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and talked about the shape of a beer pint or the beauty of cricketing, for example.
I never spoke to him about such things.
Most of my life he was to me a smileless man in a corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley and thus got an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, although the working conditions are better today than at the time.
These days the smelters are a little brighter, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths, where flames, smoke, and soot spring into mind and bring to mind the grave.
The father used to go to the bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he began to sing to himself while washing the smelter out of himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been doing it for years to get us food for the table, and I started to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the proximity of his parents.
My father never hugged and never said he loved me.
It was not until my mother began to sicken a little before her death that we began to repeat to each other that we love each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter Dawn with French, and through his own child he has been able to share the love that he himself lacked as a child.
Do you have to constantly repeat “I love you”?
Just stop hugging now!
Father, I'm 22!
Dawn with French.
Why would we not be friends?
She is an awesome mother
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why would Dawn and I not be friends?
She is an awesome mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the mother’s death.
When I started to suffer from high overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to do a full translation.
After that, I started to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce symptoms.
It’s very difficult –
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry’s well-known, short beard may describe his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in making a theater.
Next, the Comedy of Misrepresentations and the Fences of August Wilson (‘Fences’).
Making a theater offers a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started his career as a 16-year-old factory employee.
A DJ noticed him on stage doing imitations and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry’s TV career began in the mid 70’s. “For quite a long time, I was the only black imitator and comedian on the TV,” he says.
Henry learned while working.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn how to produce jokes from a conveyor belt in 1975–1985, while I was alive with stardom and was on TV, it was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where the characters appeared in black, so Henry ended up as a comedian in the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I would never have participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and objectionable, I was able to work in huge events and learn how the audience is treated.
Still, “the British TV’s award-winning, multi-year favourite and light entertainment program” was at the same time “the grotesque parody of black-skinned people”.
Henry worked in the second comedy series in the 80s, where he made both jokes and admired the black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as the Chef in the comedy series "Gareth Blacklock"!
Henry spent the next decade with advertisements, documents, TV series and film parts, but after his series of LennyHenry.tv shown on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: “What are you going to do next, Len – now it seems that you are just pedaling on your spot or you are walking on the sidewalks”.
Next up was the documentary series “What’s So Great About...?” on the Radio 4 channel.
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn’t really taught us properly at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class who wears tights and has money.
That’s why Shakespeare’s theme sparked fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: “Try.
Do not abandon the whole idea before you know what you are talking about.
Meet the words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 verses from Othello’s last speech for the document and he had been sold.
I felt that I could do this.
It felt almost like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
That’s what it’s all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play months before it was done.
The play was finally a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but that did not quite happen.
Shortly after, Henry played the main role in the Comedy of Misrepresentations.
Suddenly I played at the British National Theatre, and I couldn’t believe it.
At one point in my mind, the idea came to mind: “Oh, you have changed.”
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
A small voice in my mind said to me: ‘You have to perform for 10 minutes alone until the computer is working again.’ ”
Instead, the supervisor’s assistant announced that the presentation will continue as soon as the problem has been fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me sighed for relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
You are part of the play, stay in your role”
Henry "Fences" in Duchess Theatre
It was challenging to learn the lines to play "Fences".
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; “This is what you have to do”.
Of course, this is what Henry says in a HUMBLE voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still essentially a comedian: the little boys of humour are constantly interrupting our conversation as he switches from one imitation to another.
Absence of stand-up comedy is a question of will, as getting immediate praise from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you are constantly thirsting for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but in general it no longer inspires me in the same way it used to be.
I ask Henry if he’s going to go on a new stand-up tour anymore.
I’m really happy to sit together with the instructor who helps shape the whole trip beginning, middle and end, and I don’t think I’ll ever give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting –
It's really fun.
When acting, the story is constantly told, and I like to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya prepares a register of officials to remove “ghost workers”
Kenya has started to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove “ghost workers” from the board’s payroll.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks should no longer be paid, a government announcement was announced.
The Board of Directors suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate public sector corruption after entering office in 2013.
According to an audit conducted earlier this year, the wage and other financial irregularities of “ghost workers” amounted to at least $1 million a month.
The government suspects that wages are paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official duties, Wanyama Chebusiri from BBC reports on Nairobi, the capital.
In order to ensure that their data are stored in biometric registration format, all officials must report themselves to the register in the following weeks in a government bulletin.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do this without proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
This measure makes a significant sense in the public sector, as it defines how many people actually work in their jobs, and also cleans up the payroll at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of “ghost workers”,” says Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of the Department for Decentralisation and Design.
The result for the financial year 2015 in Seinäjoki may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit, unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is expected to be approximately 9.4 million deficits.
Possible ways of improving efficiency were to reduce the scope and level of services, as well as the purchase of services, the sale of assets and subsidies, and the increase of tax and payment income.
Of the EUR 10 million qualifying target for investments, 8.5 million is in size.
There will be no relief in the situation of municipalities.
New obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenue, increased unemployment and a five per cent cut in central government contributions further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the Economic Seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The City Board agrees that savings must be achieved.
The ship must be reversed in line with the strategy, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the proposals for the preparation of the Executive Board.
The City Board’s proposals are the basis for the budget preparation at the Council’s Economic Seminar on Monday, 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds to the City Board and the City Council through the committee discussion.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested as suspects of “intrigue” against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of “anti-government plots”, local media sources say.
The police authorities did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were in contact with last December’s corruption investigations aimed at government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey, charged with the organisation of a wide criminal rate and the monitoring of telephones.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President of Turkey (who served as Prime Minister during this period), said that the police were part of the activities planned against him by the Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took her daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace in all Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is a leading teacher at Slaviansk school, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter visits, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The first school day celebrations include traditional children’s embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas Perry said the abusive tweet was unauthorized
A defamatory picture of a democrat district attorney was sent from the verified Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry on Sunday night, while hearing the accusations of abuse of power.
The tweet was removed later, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore that she had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorizedly from my account.
I don’t accept the tweet and I’ve deleted it,” the later release said.
Perry's background forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
While tweets were sent from Perry’s verified Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the image.
The first tweet included a slanderous joke about Travis district attorney Rosemary Lehberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry prevented the grant of Mr. Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused, and Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
Tweet’s title was: “I don’t always drive drunk, three times allowed with larger amounts of perm... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing my finger.”
I'm Texas' drunkest democrat.
The Lehmberg Office did not lead a large jury against Perry.
The study was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor at San Antionio, appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry has said he was innocent and called the accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the court responsible to reject the accusations and said that the law against which the most senior governor in Texas is accused is unclear, mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut down $7.5 million in government subsidies for a government unit in charge of public inviolability that operates in Travis County and manages public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry’s decision received a left-wing follow-up group to submit an official complaint.
Perry’s verified Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes also famously.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa Election Meeting during his 2012 presidential election campaign, Perry felt that he would end the draw by publishing a photo of himself on Twitter on the lake with the text “Here I will, South Carolina!”.
According to Berkeley, the housing market is again “normal”
One of London’s most important developers has warned that the South-Eastern English housing market has “returned” to a normal level of activity.
The capital city of London has been plagued by huge demand and steep price rise, while fearing widespread credit bubbles, causing the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of Berkeley, said that “at the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of trades have returned to normal since the spike in 2013” and added that this has enabled the “stable operating environment”.
The London housing market went well during the recession as foreign investors sought the capital by hordes.
According to land register data, the prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley’s private, affordable and student buildings increased by about a fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423 000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London’s properties less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by the new real estate tax laws and political rhetoric about possible “household tax” before the May general election.
The London-based real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April housing loan report, in which more stringent lending regulations were reported, would lead to a lower level of market growth in terms of both the sales volumes of real estate and prices in the second half of the year.
The recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans declined in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast for real estate prices in London by 3%, as the price index measuring the opinion of homeowners has already started to weaken.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped in the quarter from one year ago, says real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital city is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased income from sold properties to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that “the demand for a well-designed, right product at the best locations has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained brisk.”
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3 742 new homes in the previous year, which is almost a third more than during the peak preceding the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% year-on-year, up by 18% to £380 million and net sales by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley announced on Monday before the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s merits of the year correspond to the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the full year is £450 million.
Berkeley stock sold evenly on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon for £ 23.96.
Hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence nudes online
Jennifer Lawrence will attend the 85th Academy Awards ceremony.
The hacker, who claims to hold 100 other star images, leaked Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence's photos online.
The star confirms that the pictures are genuine and condemned the hacker for “a cheeky breach of privacy”.
The authorities have been contacted, and all who publish the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will receive the accusations.
Images that were originally published on the 4chan image publishing page were apparently in the wrong hands due to the weakness of the Apple iCloud storage system, and there are dozens of other female stars on the list of 100 other stars that were hacked, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
It is not known how much of the images are genuine, although Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
For those who look at my photos and my husband’s photos taken in the privacy of our home years ago: hopefully you have a good mood,” Winstead tweeted.
However, the Victoria Justice of the ‘iCarly’ and ‘Victorious’ series of Nickelodeon denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that ‘these so-called nude pictures of me are FALSE, do you not understand’?
Let me make the end of this right from the start.
BuzzFeedin announced late on Sunday that a pop star, Ariana Grande, denied the authenticity of the pictures of the star.
Only an excerpt from Howard Jacobson’s praised novel, which tells us about love and the letter J
They dissolved, it best described what happened, gradually they separated from each other like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from the woman that it was too serious, cumbersome, intense, disconnected, and perhaps also a little spiky.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the spiky.
Yes, he was spiky like a hedgehog.
The last victim of his thorns had been an early relationship that had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his loneliness, and it might have brought some content into his life even.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and he was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, from the village of the north, which was still more barren and farther from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with an older travel companion, whom Kevern expected to be his aunt, who had inherited the house which was located in a damp but paradisiacal valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately Paradise Valley.
There had been no one living in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the snails had left their mark on the windows keeping the whole place as their own, the garden was filled with weeds reminiscent of giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, garden full of secrets.
Written by: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” was nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
Nominations will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying the surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening to the receptionist, through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news, when Ailinn’s crossed legs, tanned by the sun, brought to Kevern’s mind a song that had been sung long ago by a black-skinned performer, which his father had often listened to the blinds of the cabin below.
Your foot is too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They weren’t forbidden – nothing was actually forbidden – they weren’t just played anymore.
They were wanted to be forgotten, as was the word itself.
The general opinion was that what was not achieved by laws and declarations: just as in literature people chose to read the heroes’ memoirs, cookbooks and romances, they prefer ballads in terms of music.
By the time of the day, Kevern began to key up the fictional piano and sing a serenade to Ailinn's big feet in a cheeky, comical voice.
Ailinn did not understand.
It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller,” Kevern told him, and naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" escaped from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father while he was small.
His father said that he had played the same game with his father.
If you let the word that started with j in your mouth and didn’t remember to lift two fingers before your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn’t very fun to play then and it wasn’t it even now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of it.
Even the jazz was not actually declared forbidden, it was not just played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was room in life for only one word.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It had been the same for wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit presented through music.
Even though Kevern hadn’t heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father’s seminal CD collection.
Well, at least he didn’t have to tell Ailin that the Fats Waller was black.
Considering Ailinn's age, it was likely that he didn't remember the time when popular singers weren't black.
Even here, there was no need for laws or coercion.
The obedient society meant that each of its parts was accepted as grateful, grateful, that they were as if they had been spared from the trade of happiness, the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, Afro-Caribbean families are best suited for entertaining and sports, so they sang and run.
Originally from the Indian continent, they were as naturally gifted with electrical appliances, so it was their job to make sure that every family had a working phone that was used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When that which happened, IF it happened, those from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled intimidatedly in the fear that they would be accused of splashing the flames and fearing that those flames would reach them next, opened restaurants serving labneh yoghurt and burning the waterpipe, and continued their lives with eyes cast into the ground and depressed by boredom.
Let everyone act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung into music.
Love was expressed through music.
They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except perhaps for big-footed ones.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant leaves of cabbagehead plants.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn’t want to raise two fingers to his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn considered him strange already now.
He thought it was amusing,” he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head unbelievingly, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
Nothing else to see in the whole world than Ailinn’s huge, crow’s black hair.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
”If you say so once,” he said but didn’t sound convinced.
However, it does not explain why you sing it to me.
Ailinn seemed to be genuinely confused.
Are my feet so big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not really great.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course, I do not hate you.
It was just a silly song.
He could have said “I love you,” but it was still too early for it.
”You’re charming about me because of your thick ankles,” he tried to fix the situation.
I am twisted in that sense.
This was not helpful.
He had wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to amuse himself, the effect was quite different, because, like his father, he lacked the convincing charm with which the cruelty of jokes can be controlled.
Perhaps his father had meant to be cruel.
Perhaps he, Kevern, wanted the same.
Despite their gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair, and at the same time poured wine, which they had just drunk.
Even wine was made only of elderflowers, so he couldn’t use it for the reason of colliding.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
”And your thick head is what perversely attracts me in you,” he said...
Not only that I don’t feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessarily cruel words, and because of the fear that appeared to him at the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he would hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in the northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been like life here as well.
The same huge, squeaky sea that waved against them.
The same confusing men, though paler and more devilish than their smugglers and smugglers, wandered from pub to pub, ready to hit every woman who would dare to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He would still see a thick fist if he weren't careful!
Suction first – pussing had become the most common word for male and female erotic encounters; antidote to unimportant love ballads pumping out – suck first and then attack.
In Kevern's opinion, too much of it was too much, because already breastfeeding itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from a terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised him.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
Ailinn followed him – just as his travel companion watched Kevern’s going upstairs – a man who himself was the reason for his heavy life.
Adam going out of the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and men in general, though some of them had raised their hands to attack him.
A man who turned his back, bowed, disgraced, defeated, had lost all the will to fight—why did he feel that the vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had seen once before before this time what?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event, the intelligent and eager 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the Public Opinion-based private facility Ofnow, conducted a brief study on the continuation of low and medium violence in the regions of the country where the decline of violence, or even the end, was most likely considering the money and energy used to eradicate it.
Much has already been achieved, and much has not yet been done,” he wrote, “so that the natural aggression of the people who fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those abandoned and secluded corners, where, despite the church towers beyond the hedges, human tenderness has rarely been known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desire it generates.
The people cry with sentimental ballads, devour stories of defeated adversity, and swear by the virtues of married and family life, but at the same time, old-fashioned cruelty keeps both rural communities and urban common areas in unceasing grip, and there is evidence of a new, more wicked will to fight in homes, workplaces, streets and even playgrounds.
You have to complain about the tendency to dramatize,” his director commented after reading the whole report.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered his gaze to the ground.
In addition, I have to ask: are you atheist?
To believe I don’t have to answer that,” said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to her right not to answer any personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again silence.
I don’t ask,” Luther Rabinowitz said, “because I oppose atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
This workplace does not maintain prejudices.
We are the servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain kind of hypersensitivity is completely acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
You clearly have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or evil, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
It was as if it had taken place yesterday, if it had taken place in the first place, to destroy the earth’s vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingo pink LED light proclaimed a pattern that Ofnow had already distributed to the land in the previous quarter or longer.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, chat, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the sung word is better than written, but nothing beats love.
I understand well what you want to say,” Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when he was sure that his instructor had finished, “and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to it, what happened if it happened.
This time, however, we do not shed our hatred and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
”You go too far,” he said, “when describing as “errors” the deeds our grandparents could or could not do.
You will also go too far as you say that they shed their ‘hate and distrust to others’.
A person like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about ‘us’ or ‘they’.
There was nothing ‘us’ or ‘other’.
It was a time of chaos, that’s all we know about it.
If we are quite honest, in that chaos,” Esme ventured to continue, “no group of society can say that he had behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether good or bad.
It was then.
There’s no need to talk more about it – this is what we agree with.
And just as it is unnecessary to distribute accusations, there is also no need to make adjustments, be they appropriate or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But what is the past for, if it is not learned--
The past exists so that we can forget about it.
If I can add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
”I’ll go through your report,” he said and expressed that it was time for Esme to leave.
The next day, as he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist riding on the sidewalk, who was described by passers-by as “bad souls and furious”.
Chances happen.
Lesotho's army denies planning a blow; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho's military officials have banned the strike of the government and said they were working against the police, who were suspected to be armed by political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane escaped from the country, saying that the army had besieged his official residence and taken over the government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state traveled with his family to the neighbouring country of South Africa after telling them that he has suffered a death threat.
Army representative Major Ntlele Ntoi forbade the blow and said that the army thus responded to the threat that came from “political fanatics.” The police said that they had tried to arm the fanatics.
Lesotho’s defence forces took action with several intelligences that some police forces attempt to arm young party fanatics when they were ready to cause problems,” he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to Clayson Monyela, Chairman of the South African Government, military operations looked like a revolutionary company.
Even though no party has claimed to have defeated the government by force, Lesotho’s efforts at the Defence Forces show the characteristics of a revolutionary company in every way,” he says.
According to the officers of Lesotho's army, soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing leads the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Lesotho has experienced tensions since June, when Thabane interrupted Parliament's sessions due to the disagreements of the great coalition government.
He denies that he has disregarded the power of the government in this way, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft to establish a data center in Uusimaa
Information technology company Microsoft has established a large data center in Uusimaa, where the company does not agree to specify its location.
In a press release sent by Microsoft to the media, the company states that it does not disclose the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
For Microsoft, it is an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars.
In public, the centre had previously been bet on Oulu or Kajaani.
Microsoft will completely stop at its Oulu office, which will take up to 500 people to work.
All in all, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors says to STT that the company does not comment on the number of employees employed by the new data center.
On Monday, Kauppalehti told about the establishment of the data centre in Uusimaa.

Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video under water, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most economical option is a water resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules to follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are closed waterproofly.
In addition, set camera shooting settings to match the photos or video you want to take.
Some cameras or camera and camcorder combinations have a setting to optimize shooting conditions under water.
In addition – before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can be taken.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of 5 feet, others up to 50-60 feet.
Explore both standard and waterproof models in our buying guide and digital camera reviews.
Take multiple photos – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is hard to see under water, and the image composition can either succeed or fail.
So take several photos.
If your camera also allows bracketing, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface as you shoot in the pool, lake or sea.
This way you also get more colors in your images; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the subject.
This is an important advice when shooting on land, but even more important under water, as light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the subject so that the subject fills the entire image up to the frames.
China does not let Hong Kong choose its leaders – protesters swear by revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not elect candidates for the 2017 election despite the growing democratic reform of demanding peacelessness.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests of the Hong Kong Business District after the activists started planning and implementing demonstrations only for hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the People’s Congress of China gives practically communists the power to eradicate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating,” says Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with the autocratic government.
Li Fei, Vice-Secretary-General of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese administration, saying that general nomination for a leader in Hong Kong would be too “chaotic.”
Since 1997, when the UK handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised that it would choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday’s decision was a breakthrough because it allowed Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the election process through the appointment committee, which is managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who ‘love the country and love Hong Kong’ are accepted.
The summer preceding the decision, Hong Kong hosted some of the biggest and most prominent protests in the region for years.
Behind the campaign, which defends democracy, was largely Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to prevent the operation of the business world block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine general voting rights.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central shop supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong’s main government buildings.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and they would create protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not disclose the details apparently, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their online press release, the organisers said that the movement ‘regards the Occupy Central campaign as a last resort only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way’.
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity to engage in dialogue has broken down and the conquering of the city centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, peacelessness is fueled by the feeling that residents are slowly losing power over their city.
The wave of people arriving from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the growing pressure in Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong’s life – the business world.
The protest they are talking about can lead to big financial losses, depending on how many people take it and how long it will take,” says the legislature Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to spread the worry that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
The Chinese state media has also presented stories that Hong Kong’s democracy activists are the minions of the Western powers that instill revolution”.
This summer, activists organised an informal referendum on voting rights, involving 780 000 people – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the biggest demonstrations of democracy in the region.
U.S. Prom tradition strikes UK universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to respond to the demand by setting up the first luxury travel format in the UK for today’s students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure as memorable an entry to the university as possible.
According to Stewart, there is also a safety aspect in the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property through the country in cars loaded to the brim.
Combining this with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today’s students as easy and professional transportation to the university as possible.
According to the company’s representative, reservations have not yet been made because the service has only been established, but added that “students will start placing orders in the next few weeks”.
The company believes there is a demand for the service, even though most students pay £9 000 tuition fees.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, and now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organisation criticizes a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, Vice President of the organization’s higher education section, “this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the majority of students”.
Many of their studies begin this month to be shocked by the level of living costs, as the available financial support in the form of loans and grants has been left behind by the tremendous rise in basic living costs, and it is only possible to start thinking about where to find thousands to use for as simple a thing as to arrive at the campus.

Real estate agents removed the sales image of a house for sale in Suffolk after discovering that a big pig is lying in the living room of the house in the photo.

Connells describes the former meeting house as “a unique one-bedroom house”.
Even though the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it is still visible in advertisements.
The sale of the house has attracted interest in social media, where it is asked whether the pig belongs to the price of the house.

Bulgarian prison staff keeps national protest
Hundreds of prison workers all over Bulgaria showed their minds in front of the Ministry of Justice of Sofia, the capital.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old working regulations, which were recently changed.

The protest of the prison workers’ organisation is also expected to involve members of the Ministry of the Interior’s trade union.
Basketball: Fan's encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin had to faint into the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland’s victory today.
He was able to forget his sysiblack U.S. match and overcome Ukraine’s second half with his blood-staining solutions.
But Salin gave all the glory to the wolf fans, and did it in style:
I mean to faint there at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
There was nothing in the eyes, but it was blurred.
The noise and the white public sea were almost too much for me.
Salin’s power moments consisted of nine surfaces at a rapid pace, ball game, plate and woodwork everywhere.
I don’t know how it did, but I got into such a flow state that everything was successful.
They only come from somewhere, now a very important place," Sasu exuded.
That’s my role.
Do all that.
Now it was great to see that the others were caught in the plot.
It seized the whole gang.
The hall is a team pleasure pill and spirit creator, so no wonder his example took the whole team on a flight that was too much for a big and rough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Championships after 32 years of taking a break: Out of the previous, aggravated referee game remained in mind
Heikki Montonen (right) was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men’s national volleyball team last played in the World Championship final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where legendary Reino Kosonen was the second Finnish coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the first group.
In the resolution balls of the match, the referee game was blatant," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the back line.
Suddenly, the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the pasmas were more confused," said Parkkali.
Finland played in the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and finally finished 17th.
Finland is again among the world’s champions as the Polish World Cup kicks off today on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the course of 32 years.
The strength values of the players are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average lengths of players have also increased.
The game is even faster," Parkkali thought.
But how does it happen in Poland?
Finland’s player material has expanded, and we can share it.
I expect Finland to continue from the start block.
Then you can get tight already," says Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victorious fight against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Championship tournament.
It is hoped that now 17th place will be drawn.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust," said Parkkali.
Sport legend Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.

Finnish tourists saved Cita from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the thanks"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog were in trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered bravely to help.
On the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
In a public Facebook update, Mikkelsen told him that the Cita dog, who had been on the mountains on Thursday, hurt his paws.
An injured dog was no longer able to walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it be.
I tried many times to lure and pull it forward, but its legs didn’t just carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, from a nearby hotel or from passers-by.
As the evening darkened, the situation began to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited Galdhøpiggen, the highest mountain in Norway, and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively peaceful in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with his dog, Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanomat in the message he sent.
It soon happened to be a German man with a mattress for a trip.
From the mattress to the Cita we got a pair like which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came after us for a moment after thinking about what to do with the dog and carrying the dog on his lap for a while, Soini says.

The dog could be carried down with the help of a camping mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying in difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once more.
Soini answered him on Sunday, but the Germanman is evidently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have returned.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn’t thank them enough.
They certainly don’t know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am eternally grateful to them.
On the night against Monday, Soini were already on their way home.
They had been happy to hear from Mikkelsen: "Cita better than that!"

Genetic abnormality is often diagnosed incorrectly
The British woman was afraid of death for years due to the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years left, because he had a second illness diagnosed.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth's disease (CMT), which means a group of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, the wrong diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as they are known so little.
According to estimates, about 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms of motorism, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toes tipping.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
At the age of 13, Rodgers thought he was ill with Friedrich's ataxe (FA), which has a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed that he would be in a wheelchair before turning 18 and dying before reaching the age of 30.
Today, the mother of two 51-year-olds says that “as a child, I knew that I cannot do the same things as others.
I fell daily and took everything longer than others.
I was never able to skate or skateboard with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten his legs, and after leaving the room, he quickly glanced at his study papers saying he was suffering from FA.
I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA association,” he says.
When I got information from them, I was upset and in a panic-like state.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in between I would slowly lose my whole ability to function.
I went through this on my own and designed my own funerals.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, “girl gold, I don’t think you have this disease because otherwise you would already be in a wheelchair”.
I think you suffer from a significantly less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
When I was told what CMT disease is, I thought I was postponed,” he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A hundred immigrants found in a coal car in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegally transported trains, the Ministry of the Interior said on Monday.
The smugglers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.

Migrants were found late on Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they are, where they came from and where they are going," said Ivo Koteski, Communications Officer at the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, migrants had paid about 3 000 euros each to enter Greece, and even more 800-900 euros to enter Serbia.
Illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia, a couple of million people, on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody Syrian civil war.

Areva has delivered an updated schedule for Teollisuuden Voima TVO Olkiluoto 3.

Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of shore plot to Bottas - value about 60000 euros
The Government of Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare plot of land on the shores of Lake Kärkjärvi to the formula driver Valtteri Bottas from Villähde.
The municipal government showed a fair sport spirit and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel noises at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syrakki.

The beach is shallow and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has been successful in sports with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
The spearhead world champion Aki Parviainen and the aerobick world champion Tuuli Matinsalo got the detached plots from the municipality and built the magnificent detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their properties and moved away.

Bottas is a native Nastolan and his situation is different, Syrakki inches and believes Bottas will remain in his hometown.
Hull rescued attacker Hernandez's club with record amount
The Premier League club Hull invested the club’s record amount in the acquisition of the Uruguayan national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez switches to Hull from the Italian club Palermo for £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
The agreement is three years.
Hernandez hit 14 goals last season when Palermo defeated Serie B and rose to Italy’s main league.
In Uruguay, he has scored seven goals in 14 matches.
Last summer’s World Championship finals Hernandez came in two matches from the exchange to the field.
Abel is fantastic sourcing and shows how far we’ve gone in a short time,” said Hull’s head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also said that he had acquired Senegal's national captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russia's space experiment failed - gegoes sent on a sex trip died
Five little gekkos sent to Russian space have died," says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation's space organization.
Gekot traveled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than one and a half months.
The satellite returned to Finland on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of gecks in a weightless state.
One male geek and four females took part in the experiment.
Although the experience sounds strange, it was serious.
The effects of weightlessness, for example, on the development of gekko eggs, are only known little.
Through the effects of gekkos, it is possible to anticipate the effects of weightlessness on a person while he is in a space similar to a longer period of time, illustrated by New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the death time and cause or cause of death of the gecks are investigated.
According to the news agency Interfax, passengers who were crossed into "sex gigs" were frozen.
It is also surprising that fruit flies travelling on the same Foton-M4 survived the trip without any effort, and they also gained progeny.
France arrested terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a suspect of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being recruited by a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
The authorities got behind the man after he had lured a 16-year-old girl for money to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely ignorant of her intentions and told the authorities that the family has no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man’s actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalising young people who are attracted to the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
The authorities estimated that about 800 French citizens or French people have traveled to Syria during the last conflict, returned from there, or are currently planning to leave for Syria.
Koponen: We have great chances of winning
The basketball team’s wishes for a further position are in the game when Finland meets Ukraine in its second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening loss for the United States was expected, Ukraine, on the other hand, belongs to the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe that we have good opportunities for victory, Petteri Koponen anticipates.
Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first game on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is Game Director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter a quick dude, but we have played against them before and we have to get our norm defense in order,” Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than its previous loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee that a normal wolf pack will be seen in the field,” Möttölä said.
Claimed photos of Hollywood stars spread online - part confirmed as real
On the internet spreads a bunch of nudes that are claimed to represent well-known celebrities.
For example, actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "sleeping campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment by Lawrence's representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant privacy violation.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, the agents will threaten.
According to TMZ, actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images of her are genuine.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know that the pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible ailment was seen for this.
I feel compassion towards all who fell victim to hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actor Victoria Justice says that images that go under his own name are faked.
Real or fake nudes are also on the move from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsk and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: "Doesn't work enough to get out of here"
FC Honka is currently the last place in the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala’s comments after Sunday’s VPS match describe the very confusing current situation of the club.
I have not had a goalkeeper coach for four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after the struggle that ended with 1-2 losses.
In the first half of the game, Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes.
Goalkeeper Viitala wasn’t pleased with bad defense.
Player traffic has been busy this summer in Hong Kong, which is why defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a tight pace.
With player roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they may not even deserve.
Some people don't work enough to get out of here sometimes," Viitala snorted without naming any individual players.
Honga’s head coach, Shefki Kuqi, agreed to some extent with Viitala.
I said after the game to certain players that if you come to the training and games to have fun and think you are a Premier League player and don't have to work, then you probably are in the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I have given many young people time to play.
If they do not want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, then it is not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded players that they cannot expect immediate success when the playmates are constantly changing.
This season, there has not been twice in a row the same assembly.
Especially at the defensive end, the group has changed.
That’s the biggest reason we are in this position,” Kuqi said.
After a VPS loss, Honka is a series jumbo, with the last TPS at the tied points.
There are still seven rounds of Veikkausliiga, so there is still time for Espoo residents to avoid falling to Ykkö.
I have never dripped a team, and I’m not going to drip now.
We won't really drip from this series," goalkeeper Viitala threatened.
Lars von Trier doing a decades break after TV series

Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his uplifting media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
He directed the Kingdom series to television in the 1990s.

The British Isabelle Roberts roared so loudly when ice-cold water was poured on him that he damaged the bones of his face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken care of after she roared to complete the Ice Bucket challenge so firm that her jawbone went from place to place.

The 20-year-old British who participated in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital, where the jaw was put back in place.
The video clip has become an internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The perspective on howling wolves (kin): How can you explain the increase in the number of fans?
Today was a great feeling.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played against France at the Euro final in the Maroussi ball hall in Athens.
Not Pehkonen exaggerated.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the hundred Finns who shouted at the noise of 20 000 spectators, otherwise in the empty hall.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukraine World Cup match?
In Bilbao, a hundred Finnish fans have eighty times as many.
The 1995 European Championships were a time of search for Finnish basketball.
The men cleared their way to the final by winning, for example, in a Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to Europe's cream.
Everything looked great.
There were promising young people, such as Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann lifted Möttölä with lime lines to the final tournament team.
A solution that many people disagreed about.
Now you can say that Dettmann was wise from afar, even though not everything went according to the manuscript.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
At the Athens Games, the Finns were reportedly present a little over a hundred.
Among them were journalists, players’ relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there are a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown into incomprehensible proportions.
No one can say an exact number of Finnish competition tourists.
The estimates have been moved between 7 500-10 000.
Whatever the number is, it is an incomprehensible number.
Here is explaining to sports sociologists.
In the global world economy, companies move across borders.
In sports, there is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys are succeeding in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Physical Sociology.
Both in Spain and at the Volleyball World Championships in Poland are sure to have Finnish people looking for an experience.
Shared experience.
It still doesn’t explain everything.
Even in sports, there must be attraction.
Itkonen makes sport a part of the popular culture.
It is a lower threshold to go to sports than to see art in Berlin.
Without success, the masses still cannot move.
Let's go back to 1995.
Then head coach Dettmann challenged basketball union and players to get professionally into top-level sports.
It took almost ten years to do so.
Then the direction changed and the national team activities were put on a pedestal.
The volleyball team did the same move a bit earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to produce their top sports, where the holy trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
In this case, the audience is also interested.
And the media has taught what such carnivalism is, Itkonen points out.
Can ball games transfer this massive interest to home-made series as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played on average for hundreds or just over a thousand viewers.
Itkonen considers the question good and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good for the species.
Another school believes that interest is moving.
The other is the one who does not want the sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic leagues are not twice interested.
There is a challenge for companions in the middle of a drug.
Verification of Bottas plot - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola will reward the formula driver Valtteri Bottas on the shoreline home plot.
The municipal government unanimously approved the delivery of a plot of 1.4 hectares on Monday.
In the future, a holiday home will be built on the plot.
Nastola has been monitoring Bottas’ success since the karting times.
He is considered a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shores of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become a part of Nastola’s municipality as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in dismantling condition in the area, of which the municipality will dismantle six of them by the end of this year.
Bottas won Formula 1 in the Belgian Grand Prix this year.
He is fifth at the World Cup points.
Bottas is a native native of Nastola and lived in Villähde, Finland.
He now lives in England but visits Nastola whenever he is free from formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothing comes - but barely for the poor
It is currently presenting and testing them in the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren’s smart shirts are tested by field footballers, but Marcus Giron, one of the top amateurs of university players, also likes it.
According to him, the shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
In the nylon shirt, silver sensors are woven, from which the information is transmitted to the mocha on the shirt and from there on to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The central unit is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house hasn’t told the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor even hinted at its price,” Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothing.
Athos from California has brought a smart shirt and smart shorts for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
Clothes cost a hundred dollars per piece and the size of the thumbs they require will cost two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about the techno clothing.
A smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1 000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, who started his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students of later annual courses lend their books against nominal compensation instead of selling the books immediately.
My book of mathematics would normally have paid $180; I paid $10 for its use for the entire semester and a sum of sandwiches,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last term book would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he used them for $120.
According to the University Executive Board, an average student spends more than $1200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay far less for it than the students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which operates over 250 campus bookstores, the leasing of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the field reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores last spring had leasebooks, says Trevor Meyer, Chairman of the Neebo company.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are acquired from bookstores on campuses.
Here are the simplest ways to save you clear money.
Online stores
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained at a third of the price it would cost in the campus bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hosteler’s book “Calculus” the 9th edition of the book has a recommended price of nearly $290, but in the special books online Chegg.com book is available for $29.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader does not interfere with others' notes and worn appearance.
For example, the ‘Calculus’ book is available from the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25 years at Brigham Young University, says he bought the book “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” from Amazon.com online store for just $0.42.
As a new book would have paid $48.
Ingrid Bracey, Director of Amherst's College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics, recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used on the course.
At times, reforms of the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
It is a good idea to consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting a “Calculus” book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Learn about the rules of the rental company, such as notes, how to use the highlighter, and how to spend on the following charges.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Instead of ordinary papers, e-books can also come up with a question.
Sometimes these books are rented out, in which case the e-book is paid to its holder, e.g. Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg Shop gets the ‘Calculus’ as an e-book for about $61 for six months.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most, because several classics today can be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
It pays off to compare different vendors, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start Pepperdine in law, recommends taking advantage of the book ISBN number to figure out the price, as it allows you to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure that the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full price from the university bookstore.

Almost double number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, almost two people have died in fires compared to last year.
According to the Finnish Central Organisation for Rescue Services (Spek) media monitoring, 55 people have already died in 49 different fires so far.
At the same time last year, there were 31 deaths of fire.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
Over 65 years of age has been 11.
According to the association’s statistics on fire deaths, the last worse situation was in 2009, when by the end of August 64 people had died in fires.
The majority of fire deaths take place in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in houses and seven in row and other houses.
Spek reminds us of resolving the fire safety of your home.
According to Spek, the functionality of at least all smoke alarms in the home should be ensured.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing equipment is easy to set up.
All areas of the home must also have an accessible exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical appliances they are allowed to use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opposition to the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, around 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall at a so-called counter-peak meeting.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events on the weekend and talked with the protesters who had arrived even from Belgium.
The young people were rescued by air from the Australian Blue Mountains
Two teenage hikers were taken to safety after they had been stuck in the blue mountains in New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike after noon to Govetts Leap in Blackheath on Sunday.
The relatives were concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at night eight.
A scout of local police officers and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the two were found around 23 o’clock near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knees, and the man had fallen and struck his head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrawn from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, parachute troops have intensified cooperation with Russian tanks in the field.
According to an army representative, the counterman's cannonfire has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
Over the past day, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
The Ukrainian patrol ship, which had hit artillery in front of southeastern Ukraine yesterday, sank in the morning, says the Border Guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard had no certainty of what the ship was shot from.
The Separatists already reported that they had shot from the beginning on social media yesterday.
According to Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov demanded that Ukrainian troops immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the negotiations with Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should result in an immediate ceasefire without any conditions.
Lavrov also reminded that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our companies.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets flooded on Sundays in Malmö and Copenhagen, when heavy rains swept southern Sweden and Denmark.
The flooded waters cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars under.
On Sunday, the authorities estimated that it might take time to ease the flood, even though the rains were predicted to cease on Monday.
The heavy rains were surprised by the Swedish authorities and no weather warning was given in advance.
Ari Mustala, a meteorologist on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimates that the rainy front that affected the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder if it has been difficult to predict.
French socialists should “be quiet and help France,” Francois Hollande’s main supporter says
Valls urged the deeply distributed Left to “show their feelings” towards the difficult president of the Socialist Republic, whose new government composition did not achieve the approval of the French majority.
The president deserves the respect of all, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
It’s our job to stay with him,” said Valls, earning the applause.
As a calming gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave the French controversial 35-hour working week, despite the proposal that the rule should be relaxed by the new Minister of Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron earlier this week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked socialists to work together with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, led to a dissension by appearing at a meeting with representatives of various socialists and criticising the social party for allowing “France to give up hope for the future”.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right national front, mocked the ongoing social dissension and said that the new government of Valls would not take longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so did Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government since the previous one did not last even during the summer.
And the new government won’t last until autumn or winter,” Le Pen said to the journalists.
He repeated his party’s proposal to dismantle the Parliament and was certain of his party’s election victory in the premature elections, and he would be ready to lead the party himself.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far-right held the top of the list in the May EU elections.
According to a survey by Journal du Dimanche, published on Sundays, 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several competing groups before the end of the Hollande period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at Po University, warned that the French will soon lose their patience, unless the new national government manages to improve the economy and record-high unemployment.
There is a small chance of success, but the public should quickly notice that change is happening,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may worsen further.
Pokka betrayed Finland’s host Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda.
Tomorrow Finland published a fun video of the recordings made last Thursday on its Facebook page.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the next day of the Finnish advertising puff, but the recording does not go right into the tube.
Alm-Sira confuses with her words as she tries to say the word in a budget rite, and her mix also causes Pouta and Rahkola to lose their pokes time and time again.
And these heroes should be able to pull the live stream even tomorrow, Tomorrow in Finland’s Facebook update is stated.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook more than 10 000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked in the press photo agency, was third in the series of potrets in 1972.
The picture shows Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
In May 1971, a meeting of the Socialist International was held in the building of the building masters in Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we got plenty of five minutes for filming.
I took this picture from a distance of four meters.
The light and background were right.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
Meir’s expression shows that leaders in the Middle East have struggled in the past.
At that time, the competition was successful with pictures of well-known people or events.
It is great that today you can also succeed with other images as long as there is an idea and visual torsion.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best one is Lasse Virén’s crash at the Munich Olympics.
I did not send it to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation has already paid more than five million euros
Examining the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Drug Unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki evaluates his computer science dissertation at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki argues that the monitoring of the legality of police operations and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining the computer systems of investigation and judicial processing.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables the multi-use of criminal data.
He states that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected for the investigation of a crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain and at the same time enables comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
YLE: The concept of vegetarian food in 1999 was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the vegetarian diet"
A picture of a special press release on the wall of the Women’s Journey in Tampere caused a food attack on social media, says Yle on its website.
Vegetarian diners!
Vegetarian diet with a school lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the list, we make a vegetarian option!
This is the case in a 15-year-old bulletin forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread on social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Varama, Head of Food and Cleaning Services, says to Yle that a note that has been forgotten on the wall is not correct and should have been removed long ago.
Apparently before I came, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in time.
Every student gets a meal according to their wishes, she says to Yle.
Today, in the schools of Pirkkala, pupils are offered a vegetarian option only with parental consent and a certificate from a doctor or public health nurse about a vegetarian diet.
Varma is justifying the solution to YLE by the fact that young people’s vegetarian food experiments may leave nutrition scarce and the lack of meat or chicken can cause wonder from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise near $3 billion Prestige Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., the world’s third largest cruise company, is negotiating to buy its competitors Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion, coming from people closely involved.
With the acquisition, Norwegian Cruise, with a market capitalization of $6.8 billion, would gain access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information about a possible agreement may already be published this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not yield results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be public, because negotiations are not going to take place in public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises representatives did not respond to comment requests and Apollo’s representative refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales increased by 13% from 2012 to 2013, when net sales amounted to $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates in Miami, sails under Oceania and Regent brand names, including a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its revenue in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise in emerging economies such as China and India’s middle classes.
The companies are competing to be the number one choice for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first shares in the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has held most of the company’s shares since the 2007 transaction, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 by the merger of Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company, the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
According to published information, Genting accounted for 28 per cent, Apollo for 20 per cent and private equity firm TPG Capital for 8 per cent from the end of June onwards.
The combined share of the cruise capacity of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise in North America is 82%, is indicated in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issue of its shares.
The City Board of Tampere handles the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the City Board will support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Director of Animalia, who prepares a doctoral thesis for the University of Tampere, there is a need to end quickly during dolphinariums in Finland and around the world.
In recent years around the world, fortunately, it has become more common that the keeping of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins in dolphins is not animal protection or ethically sustainable.
This vision would also be expected to reach Tampere.
The termination of the Delfinarium is not only an animal law issue, but also a question of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of Näsi dolphin confirms the requirements for the shutdown of dolphin activities.
The death is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It’s time to put a dot at the deaths, close the dolphin prison, and start exploring how to move the dolphins of Tampere to a demarcated sea area, a type of shelter for dolphins, Tuomivaara demands.
They didn’t have time to return to the dolphins’ original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have more time to experience than an invigorating concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
Animalia aims to prohibit the use of all wild animals in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Welfare Act.
This includes dolphinariums.
In support of the demand, Animalia’s Executive Director, Tuomivaara, participates in the protest on behalf of the dolphins today, the 1.9.
In the mental expression held at the Embassy of Japan in Helsinki, a stand will be taken against the dolphin hunting season starting in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2300 dolphins are captured or killed cruelly annually, either for the use of dolphinariums or for food.
Putin calls on Kyiv to open negotiations with East Ukraine on a new country
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government end the fight against separatists in the eastern parts of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “state-state” of the different region, the news sources of Russia say.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the eastern Ukraine ruled by the Separatists would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine must be reconsidered in order to empower the Russian-speaking population to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin’s demand for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiators corresponds to his obvious strategy that he has followed since five years ago: he seeks to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novossija independence, which allows it to head to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to regain the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk territory, controlled by the Separatist, whose separatists invaded Moscow in March and April after annexing the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently baptised the region as “Novorosija”, “New Russia” – this term resembles the days of splendor preceding the Russian Great Revolution.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are a “illusion” as long as the Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the October 26 parliamentary elections and the government forces attack the civilians in the Separatist-controlled areas.
We need to immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the South-Eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of people living there,” he says.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to ‘statelines’ relates to a broader independence, which has been discussed for months with Kiev’s management in an attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the independence they need to the eastern regions, Peskov says.
This cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, says Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict within Ukraine”.
An interim note by the Kremlin representative, aimed at correcting the ‘wrong interpretation’ of Putin’s comments, stressed that the Russian administration deals with the rebellion of eastern Separatists in a different way from that of Crimea, in which case, in practice, it seized an area whose 2 million people majority are ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to integrate even the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk in Eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russians and, according to pre-conflict opinions, the majority of the population advocated staying in Ukraine.
Independence, from which the Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums, gives Ukraine’s local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which in practice gives the Kremlin power over the territory that connects Russia to Crimea.
On the Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is the main fleet of Russia, as well as commercial maritime port areas and historical coastal sites.
There are also mines, factories and metal melting plants in the area between Rostov and Crimea, which produce vital products for the Russian army.
In his official speech on 7 June, the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislatures – after the new elections – consider amendments to the Constitution in order to increase the decision-making power of regions that deviate from the core of Ukraine on their own finances and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the Separatists perhaps armed and incited by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin submitted his latest request to the Government of Kyiv for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels progressed more last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded Eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the Azov Sea coast.
The security authorities of Ukraine fear that the separatists supported by Russia take over the city of Novoazovsk will be the beginning of a larger effort aimed at taking over the entire strategically significant coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led massive civilians and military staff to implement the City of Mariupol, and half a million inhabitants Mariupol is known as a steel-producing port city between Novoazovski and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels, seeking further measures to prevent future Russian violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
We will soon reach a point where there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the Ukrainian region.
The EU summit did not make decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed further sanctions to be put in place if the crisis in Ukraine is rediscovered in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armies and 1,000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, told journalists in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first Ukrainian 63 soldiers seated in Ilovakis, Russia, were replaced with 10 Russian parachute jumpers, which were imprisoned in the Ukrainian region a week ago.
Milan’s opening goal was scored by Japanese sailor Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was first hit, and a little later Jeremy Menez's penalty kick.
In the final moments of the game, however, the goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In Milan’s former striker icon Inzaghi’s coaching debut, San Siro Stadium was only halfway.
The number of spectators in the match was 39 000.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko nude photo scandal swirl
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he has rounded himself up after hackers maybe stealing his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko's nudes.
The entertainment world has been buzzing since a series of Jennifer Lawrence nudes were released on the internet as a result of an extensive celebrity hack scandal.
Hacker has been said to have a total of 60 nudes of Hunger Game star Lawrence and other superstars, such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihan, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Images of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko living in Melbourne are also apparently stolen in connection with an iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Last month, Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko, said to Confidential magazine, "this is aching".
All personal communication and images should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and distributed.
Greckon, who is in New York, is reported to have commented on the case in the online magazine ‘disgraceful’ and said that victims ‘feel themselves to be profaned’.
The hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with this previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer topless at the edge of the pool.
Palmer's film merits include the film "Love and Honor" with actress Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on hacked pictures yesterday.
Lawrence’s representative said to TMZ that “it’s a cheeky breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen was angry with the hacker in his tweet: “The publication of photos stolen from a mobile phone is in no way different from the sale of the stolen product”.
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legal point of view alone.
Finland played almost like at home and got a sensational victory from Cuba at the World Volleyball Championships.
Look at the pictures of fanfare.
On Monday, Katowice was white, not red and white, but blue and white.
According to STT, Finland’s victory was followed by nearly 2000 Finnish supporters at the Spodek Arena.
It felt like playing at home.
So big was the impact of the fans on our game, Finland’s captain Antti Siltala said to STT.
Finland was defeated by 0-2 in the game, but came to victory by 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle rise from behind six points.
Cuba was already led by 16-10, but after that Finns were cheered on.
However, a couple of hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when an airport, the charter plane was unable to land due to the heavy fog in Katowice.
So fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish ball games fans have conquered Europe at a fast pace in recent days.
In Bilbao, Spain, more than 8000 Finnish fans will be present at the World Basketball Championships.
As if every body of Finland had been the winning basket of the match, the US star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after the Saturday match.
