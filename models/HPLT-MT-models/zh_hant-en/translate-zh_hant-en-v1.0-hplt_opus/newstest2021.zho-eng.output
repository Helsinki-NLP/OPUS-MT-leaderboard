On July 26, according to external media reports, on July 18, the beautiful site of the historic buildings of the French Nantes, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul's Cathedral, was severely damaged in a fire, and the organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th day of the local time, Nante Prosecutors announced that a church volunteer who was in charge of the protection work in the cathedral had been prosecuted and was convicted of "burning fire."
He admitted that he was on fire in the church.
The 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda acknowledged that he had three fires in the cathedral at night, according to the report.
The lawyer said that the firefighters regretted doing so.
The man entered France several years ago through a means of refuge, asylum in the area of this fire-fighting disaster, and sheltered in the church.
The prosecutor said that he was trying to update his visa and was communicating with the police.
But the church said it was still hard to believe that it was a very kind, smiling face, but it would destroy the church that he loved so much.

Summary: U.S. unilateralism destroys relations between the two countries, the international argument supports China's anti-U.S. counter-terrorism
On the morning of July 24, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China notified the U.S. Consulate General of China to withdraw the establishment and operation permit for the U.S. Consulate General of Chengdu, and made specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
The United States has taken unilateral measures to cause serious distress to relations between the United States and the United States, and China has no reason to challenge the United States to respond, and take countermeasures that are just and necessary.
Andrés Borques, director of the China Research Institute for International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the U.S.-China monopolistic measures undermine the bridge between the peoples of the U.S. and U.S.-United States, causing a crisis in relations between the two major countries.
China notified the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu that it was a contravention of U.S. unilateral measures, in line with foreign practice.
Professor of the Catholic University of Argentina and Director of the Academia Sinica Research Center, Patricia Justo, said the above decision was a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the United States, not against the general United States.
The U.S. tried to re-establish the U.S. attention by suppressing China to cover its unavailability in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The United States adopts a challenging diplomatic attitude, causing serious distress to relations between the United States and the United States and the United States, and the relationship between the two countries faces serious challenges.
The United States has informed the United States of America to close its Consulate General in Chengdu, which is a normal countermeasure, in line with foreign practice, which reflects the principle of China's determination to protect its own interests, and also reflects the legitimate advantages of Chinese diplomacy.
Francis Semwinza, current Tanzanian commentator, said the above-mentioned decision was a just and necessary response to the United States temptation.
China-US relations should return to normal, and the United States should actively improve relations with China, and stop interfering with China.
The United States should focus on how to win economic and political gains with China, and how to benefit the people of both countries and the entire international society.
Ali Yosef, Executive Director of the Arab-China Friendship Association, based in Sudan, said China was forced to take countermeasures just and necessary reactions to the U.S. unreasonable conduct, in line with international law and international relations basic guidelines, also in line with foreign practice.
The former U.S. requested the closure of the Consulate General of China in Houston to seriously violate the basic guidelines of international law and international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will withdraw its previous decision to create the necessary conditions for the normal return of the relations between the two countries.
The United Daily News of Singapore said that the United States' larger strategic intention is to block China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
Although China is reluctant to see the U.S.-China relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

The engine may turn off the FAA emergency check 2000 Boeing Passengers - New China Network
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive 24 to require emergency checks on approximately 2000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft registered in the United States, as a result of the corrosion of the air-stop valves in the above aircraft may cause the engine to park in the air.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it received 4 reports of air parking on 737NG and 737Classic aircraft engines, thus making an emergency inspection requirement to check that the object is a continuous stop of more than 7 days and the number of aircraft to fly so far is less than 11 times, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
The Federal Aviation Administration warns that if all the aircraft are corrosion-resistant, the aircraft may be stuck at the opening position, causing the aircraft to lose its momentum completely and cannot re-introduce the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once a corrosion has been found to stop the valve, the airline operator must replace the key component before the aircraft is put into use again.
Later that day, the company responded that the COVID-19 outbreak caused a decrease in travel demand, and many aircraft were therefore archived or less used, "stop the valve more susceptible to corrosion."
At the same time, Boeing has advised the airline operator to check the aircraft involved. If there is a problem, Boeing will provide assistance such as repair and replacement of the valve.
According to the Associated Press, major U.S. airlines operating aircraft are usually flying multiple times in a day, but after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of aircraft are suspended; with the demand for passenger travel has recently slowed down, some of the aircraft are re-entered into operation.
The Federal Aviation Administration does not release details of four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines later disclosed one of these incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said on July 15, the aircraft suddenly turned off a motor from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas. The aircraft eventually landed in Austin.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engine of the aircraft and inspected the engine of the six aircraft in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, respectively, said on 24th that their aircraft did not have an associated air-stop engine shutdown.
The four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected and 28 of the United Airlines' aircraft will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it will check its 20 aircraft, but there is no indication of whether the engine has been turned off.
A number of media reports that the Federal Aviation Administration's emergency airworthiness directive is another shock to the Boeing.
Indonesian Lions and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, killing 346 passengers.
This series of aircraft was subsequently suspended worldwide, and this year, it was discontinued in January, and production resumed in May.
In June, Federal Aviation Administration Commissioner Steve Dickson admitted that the Federal Aviation Administration "had made a mistake" on Boeing's regulation on the 737MAX aircraft.

The Lewis family: John Lewis is a "fight for the weakest" warrior
U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, was remembered as a "war for the most vulnerable" at his memorial service on Saturday (July 25).
The public memorial service of Lewis has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There are two memorials on the first day.
At a public memorial meeting at the University of Troy, Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five siblings and a niece talked about him as a loving, fearless, family-focused man.
Henry "Grant" Lewis, the youngest brother of Lewis, said at the meeting: "He was committed to helping others in his lifetime."
Samuel Lewis said his mother warned John "Don't bother, don't bother."
He added that John didn't listen to his mother's warning, saying, "We all know that John's general counsel is always provocative, but that's a good question because of holding on to the right thing."
Lewis' brothers and sisters remind the people in the memorial service, John's most famous argument is to create "good trouble", that is, as long as it is for justice, do not avoid the starting point.
John used to apply to the Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but at the time Troy University for White School denied his admission.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel of chicken on his farm, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from the Fisk University.
After many years, the University of Troy awarded Dr. Lewis the honorary doctorate.
Doug Jones, a parliamentarian from Alabama, said the current protesters "are protesting peacefully and non-violently," as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
"Even if President Trump smashed a ship at once, he said all the protesters were rioters, but he was wrong," he said.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal nation."
A six-day series of events to commemorate Lewis, which will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday, Lewis' coffins stopped at a public commemoration event at the University of Troy, where he paid tribute to the militant movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony honored him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public commemoration event.
On Sunday, the remains of Lewis will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge of Selma.
In 1965, he and the protesters who asked Black to vote were stunned by the Alabama police in front of the bridge, and the police also cast tear gas on the protesters.
At that time, Lewis was killed.
The day after is called "Bloody Sunday."
The remains of Lewis will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
The mayor, Steven Reed, encouraged people to join the sidewalk team to complete the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear a mask and maintain social distancing when participating in the event.
Governor Kay Ivey of Alabama ordered a semi-annual flag drop on Saturdays and Sundays to commemorate Lewis.
During the nearly a week of commemoration, the remains of Lewis will be briefly rested at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, in the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for the people's commemoration.
Nancy Pelosi, U.S. House Speaker, and Mitch McConnell, the majority party leader of the Senate, announced last week that they would be able to pay tribute to Lewis on Monday and Tuesday at the U.S. Capitol.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the public event to commemorate Lewis will be held outdoors.

China's Xinshe Xinjiang Hami July 26 electricity theme: Xinjiang's deep cultivation of "sunflower field" with good clean energy
6000 more than five-dimensional sunglass, each 48 square meters, a circle arranged, such as a silver "sunflower field", as the sun changes, reflect the sun to the center of more than 200 meters high hot tower, to achieve power generation.
On the 25th, reporters saw this scene at the central power project of the Hami Salt Tower in Yiwu County, Xinjiang.
"The so-called melting tower heat generation is the reflection of the sun through the mirror to the hot tower to form heat energy, and through traditional power generation technology, heat energy is converted into electric energy."
The design principle is similar to the solar stove used in rural areas in the northwestern region of China, and the sun must be gathered.
The power plant started construction in October 2017, and reached the end of last year, covering an area of 6600 cubic meters, and planned to install a total of 14500 solar panels.
"The biggest advantage of solar power generation is that it can store the collected heat and generate it at night."
Zhang Yong said that the project is configured with a 13-hour heat storage system, which allows the generator group to maintain continuous and stable operation, not affected by light changes, but also according to the demand of the electric grid load peak, fast participation in the electric grid peak.
After the project is completed, it can achieve annual power generation of 1.98 million tonne. It can save more than 60,000 tonnes of standard coal every year, reduce more than 60 tonnes of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tonnes of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tonnes of smoke, and more than 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the city of Shichengzi photovoltaic industry park in Hami.
With more than 2300 cubic feet of solar power plant, the 714 power plants that have been built follow the sun's rotation, always keeping the sun and the polymer board facing a 90-degree right angle.
"We use two-axis tracking technology, through unified control, all power generation equipment will be adjusted according to the height of the sun, to maintain the efficiency of the power generation."
The power station long dreamqi said that under good weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the traditional photovoltaic power generation efficiency by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than seven million units of electricity generation, supplementing the demand for local electricity.
Shichengzi photovoltaic industry park is currently the largest single unit in Xinjiang, the most complete type of photovoltaic industry demonstration park, a total of 38 PV power projects, a total of 82 million kW.
In the first half of this year, the power supply was over 1.1 billion degrees, up 6% from the same period in 2019.
Hammi is one of the best solar resource regions in China.
The annual average solar radiation volume is more than 6200 trillion liters per square meter, with around 3200 hours of sunshine throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry, so good "sunflower field".
More than 250 million kW of solar power has been installed, the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeds 1.4 billion kW in the first half of this year, up about 14% year-on-year.
At present, Xinjiang grid photovoltaic power plant more than 330 seats, the installed capacity is more than 10 million kW.
It is expected that the annual photovoltaic power generation will reach 1.5 billion kWh, and the standard coal will be replaced by more than six million tonnes.

The U.S. media has unanimously asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: CCTV Author: Zhu Yan-Jing
The U.S. media has revealed the truth that China has repeatedly asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Consulate General of China of the withdrawal of the establishment and operation permit for the U.S. Consulate General of Chengdu, and made specific requirements for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities, as a countermeasure against the U.S. Consulate General of China suddenly requested to close the Consulate General of Houston on 21 days.
The U.S. government has raised many concerns about its political motives, which has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is it necessary to close the Consulate General of China?
Many foreign media say that it is not clear why the U.S. will elect the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media utterly said: for the general election.
CNN reported that the U.S. asked the Chinese to close the U.S. Consulate General in Houston to raise questions about its political motives.
The U.S. government's response to the catastrophe of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a lower rate of support for President Donald Trump before the election.
A strong strategy for China is to save Trump's support rate, according to officials of the White House, but also to reverse the White House epidemic to fail.
The article argues that the Consulate General of China in Houston is the United States' choice of a "politically driven, very cautious" goal, the United States government selected it as "to create a strong attitude, while avoiding the risk of major conflict."
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that when the U.S. election season comes and the U.S. economy is severely hit by the pandemic, Trump believes that it has a "political advantage" to fight the "China brand".
The current situation is "a spiral rise, a sharp relative struggle", which is to some extent driven by the U.S. government from the perspective of domestic consideration, will only make tension between the United States and China more deteriorated.
Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, according to CBS, which has repeatedly accused China of the outbreak.
The U.S. has almost every day a new action against Trump's so-called "China Torture the U.S." aggression.
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing connections between the two countries"
The U.S. asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston to increase tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Consulate General of China in Houston closes, in addition to diplomatic influences, Chinese citizens in the south of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services are also facing difficulties.
A commercial group in Houston regretted that the U.S. asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, claiming that the Consulate played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
This reflects the importance of China's economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy magazine website believes that this move is part of a series of aggressive initiatives that will only deteriorate U.S.-China relations.
The Reuters quoted Jonathan Polak, an expert on East Asian issues at the Brookings Institute in Chicago, said that since the establishment of a comprehensive diplomatic relationship between the United States and China in 1979, he would not want to take any action against the U.S. Consulate General of China in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the United States' move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the United States and China.
Analysts believe that this action could lead to lasting damage.
The Consulate General of China in Houston was established in 1979 as the first Consulate in the United States.
China currently has one embassy and five Consulates in the United States.

The majority of Urumqi free nucleic acid testing areas have been basically completed, high-risk areas for secondary testing - China New Network
On July 26, China NewNet Urumqi (news reporter Sunting Wen Jiang Yamin) Urumqi City health commission director Zhang Wei on the 26th reported the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing situation in Urumqi city, said that at present, the majority of free nucleic acid testing work in Urumqi city has been basically completed.
Experts from the State Council and the Autonomous Region of Urumqi City are making further evaluation of the development of the epidemic according to the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological research.
The news office of the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang held a press conference on the 26th to inform Xinjiang of the epidemic and prevention and control situation.
According to him, from 0 to 24 July, 22 new cases of COVID-19 confirmed in the city of Urumqi, including 5 cases of people with no symptoms, have been added, and 38 new cases of symptom-free infections have been added.
As of July 25th, 135 confirmed cases in the city of Urumqi, 147 undiagnosed cases.
The 25-day addition of symptoms-free people are also basically through the city's free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
The majority of free nucleic acid testing jobs in the city of Urumqi said on 26th that the majority of Urumqi's free nucleic acid testing work has been basically completed.
He also said that from experience in other regions of the country, there are many factors affecting the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of test agents, the time of infection and the time of detoxification of the inspected personnel, the condition of the inspector when the specimen is picked up (compatibility difference may result in the specimen is not in place), and the detection environment, the level of tester's operation familiarity.
For various reasons, nucleic acid testing will also produce false results.
The so-called false negative means that the person being tested is actually an infected person, but the result of nucleic acid testing is negative.
In addition, for people who have close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, nucleic acid testing is usually required to be excluded.
For people in high-risk areas of the epidemic, if there are symptoms of fever and respiratory tract, a nucleic acid test for the negative presence of a false negative, so it is also necessary to have two nucleic acid tests to be excluded.
He said, due to the above situation, in order to the health of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi City will carry out a second free nucleic acid testing in the Tianshan and Shahibak areas and other important areas, at the same time to carry out a "check of the genetic spills."
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybaq District are high-risk areas of the epidemic.

But he said that China's trade-related institutions still hold a meeting to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We have made every effort to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Mr. Peng Jiening, Vice President of the National Committee for U.S.-China Trade, said that maintaining the first phase of the agreement "is more important than ever" and that China has made further progress in opening up financial markets to U.S. companies this year.

France's largest military investment in space - New Zealand
French Defense Minister Florense Pali said on 24th that France will add billions of euros of space defense budgets to the development of space military forces in order to prevent "unfriendly movements" that other countries may do in outer space.
Pali told Provence that from 2019 to 2025, France's military project expenditure budget would increase from $3.6 billion (about $4.2 billion) to $4.3 billion ($5 billion).
According to the French Military Planning Act of 2018 approved by the French Parliament, France is expected to update its existing observed satellites and communications satellites in the future, launching three electromagnetic-audit satellites to improve the modern level of surveillance radar in space.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July that the French Air Force will set up the Space Command and the "Aeronautical and Space Forces".
Pali said she would officially announce the formation of the space force later when she visited a military school in Salon in the region of Provence.
Pali said that the space force belonged to the Air Force and was prepared by 2025 with a total of 500 people.
She said: "People used to think that space service was in the common interest of science, and that idea never came back. Now space is a place for countries to fight for global hegemony."
Pali reiterated the previous statement by Macron, claiming that the method did not intend to pick up the military.
"We're not in a military race at all, but we're responsible to fully recognize the threats we may face."
In 2017, Pali reiterated the surveillance of a French and Italian-shared military satellite.
She said, "The robbery" is a Russian satellite.
The Russian government denied this statement.
Pali said that France will soon have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and locking "the mafia behind those unfriendly moves".

U.S. census to collect immigration information through the U.S. Census for the distribution of seats in the colony
Several civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. federal government saying that the President-elect's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census is unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sara Brandon, Executive Lawyer of the United States Alliance for Civil Rights Freedom, said to the voice of the United States, "It is impossible to do so."
She added that it was difficult for Trump to determine the citizenship of a person who was being censured in the census, and "not very reliable."
Another citizen-free organization filed a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge Trump's administrative orders.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia have joined the trial.
The County of Arlington in Virginia also joined the trial on Friday.
"The Constitution of the United States requires that our population be accurately cleared every 10 years," said Gavi, Chairman of the Board of Management of Arlington County. "We must accurately clear every person who lives in Arlington County and cannot allow this illegal attempt to scare and suppress the number of people in our immigrant community to succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Marshall, the Attorney General of Alabama, said the executive order was a "victory" in the state.
He said, "The number of people living in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of residents who are legally resident."
Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked Trump administration from incorporating citizenship issues into the 2020 Census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week to oversee the U.S. Census Bureau's Secretary of Commerce, Ross, to file data on the undocumented populations of the census, so that the administration excludes these undocumented populations from the census numbers in each state, and to determine whether each state has increased or decreased or maintained its seat in the House of Representatives.
The U.S. will re-assign seats every 10 years based on demographic changes.

Convoy also mentioned that the former statement on the president's decision to have "absolute power" to re-work in each state was a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that every state has autonomy."
She explained to Trump.
However, the rumors in Convoy's mouth were rumored by Trump at the White House outbreak on April 13th.
The operation of this series of self-faced, was ridiculed by the netizens as "rewrite history".
Kellyan Convey wants to change history, she's a liar.
Trump says Michigan Governor Graham Whitmer was a dictator because she followed the medical guidelines and stopped working.
Trump wants to push back the work so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time that Kelly Convey has been controversial.

Is the 3-year-old's college playground smashed, and the school is entitled to a refund?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Si-Ji
The school was smashed and the child was stabbed.
• The Secretary-General of the United States
A three-year-old narcissistic playing in a college playground accidentally hit the head by a banging team.
After Chen's compensation, Xiaowen's father, as the legal representative of Xiaowen, complained to the court, asked the school where the incident occurred to apologize, and paid medical expenses, mental damage, etc., a total of 20,000 yuan.
Recently, the People's Court of Beijing Haidian District held that after the trial of the case, the incident school set up a protective net at the playground, has reached the appropriate security obligations, and Chen certain has made compensation, so the decision to return the plaintiff's lawsuit request.
Mr. Wen said that during the summer of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground, when he was playing the team in the playground training.
In order to avoid the risks, Mr. Xiaowen, and many other children and parents in the safe areas designated by the team.
However, after the team had dropped out of the ball, it caused the ball to fly over the safety net to the above areas and hit the Chinese brain.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed as head injury.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school court do not meet the relevant safety regulations, and the team and related facilities are not effectively managed.
The failure of the school led to the occurrence of the above incident, resulting in great physical and mental suffering, but also brought a greater suffering to his family, the school should bear legal responsibility.
According to the school, the school has set up a protective net at the playground, and posted management rules and training notifications, informing the entrance to the playground must maintain a safe distance from the training site and remind them to pay attention to their own safety, the plaintiff can not prove that the school "did not meet the security obligations", so does not agree to the compensation.
After the trial court believes that the incident is related to the university's free and open place to the public, although the school has security obligations for the management of the playground, but this security obligation only needs to meet the general attention obligations.
At the time of occurrence, the school set up a protective net at the playground, has reached the appropriate security obligations, and Chen certain also in accordance with the previously agreed compensation agreement to compensate Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan, the two sides agreed that the dispute is one-time solution.
Afterward, Xiaowen parents again advocated for school compensation, without excuse, and the court ruled that the plaintiff's entire appeal was returned.
After the trial, neither party has appealed, and the judgment has come into effect.
According to Article 37 of the Law on Infringement, the school as the manager of a public place, has security obligations; in the case of damage caused by a third party's actions, the third party assumes the responsibility of infringement, and the public place manager who fails to meet the security obligations shall bear the corresponding additional responsibility.
The judge said that because as a manager of a public place, it is most likely to understand the actual situation of the place, foresee possible dangers and damage, so as to most likely take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of loss or reduce the extent of the damage, and avoid and reduce the cost of the occurrence of the damage, and thus the law provides for its corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for the free and open playground to the public without specific entrance groups, the school's security obligations should be in line with its social activities, in particular, should take the basic security measures and for the hidden dangers have been notified of the obligation.
In judicial practice, it is also not appropriate to impose excessive security obligations on managers in public places.
If the school has adopted a protective net and has been informed of the obligations, it can be assumed that the school is not wrong and should not be held liable.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the administrator of public places such as the school did not meet the security obligations, the responsibility is also a supplement to the compensation of damages, according to the latest published civil code, the administrator assumes additional responsibilities, can also be recovered to the third party.
In such an accident, the victim should not extend the scope of the claim after receiving the direct infringer's compensation.
Under the epidemic prevention and control normalization, people exercise fitness enthusiasm is rising.
With the gradual opening of tourism business across provinces, the tourism market is also coming back soon.

Ningxia Guyuan farmer Wu Fengfang, but the old companion Datianfu, two people sitting in the car, 20 miles away from the home, drove to Liangyun Cultural Court.
Despite the difficulties in the feet for the past two years, the 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is still looking forward to "three or five rounds of play here, too."
This is an inconspicuous yard in the Guyuan city area, unlike the general agricultural house, which often conveys a pleasant Qin cavity, there are also wonderful shadow games, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavities, eyebrows and hobbies, etc.
The owner of the house, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to paint and play, and began to paint and build a cultural palace.
With the Liangyun Cultural Palace, villagers' cultural life becomes colorful.
Journalists have not yet entered the Liang Yun Cultural Center, and the Qin Cao's music has been transmitted.
The villagers of the village of Baixiang are singing the Qinchao section for the villagers.
Since she was young, she has now been very famous in the local, and as long as she has free time, she will come to the Cultural Palace to perform for the locals.
Recently, Barry has also played live webcasts.
"It's a happy thing to have a stage where more people can see their performance."
On the stage, the singer has a single glance, playing one song, even if it is amateur lovers, but the enthusiasm is not reduced.
Like the style of the quality of the farmer's house, outside of Qin Chao, Liangyun Cultural Center in the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture came.
The yard also houses more than 300 pieces of tiles, cut paper, embroidery, shadows, etc., made from different ages of agricultural utensils, traditional and handmade tiles.
Liang Yun took reporters into the hall, showing his collection of old objects, old wine glasses, tristrings, spinning cars, and so on.
Why does a farmer build a cultural palace?
"The shadow play is my home handicraft, and I started learning it since I was 15 years old."
Liangyun Cultural Center was established in 2012 and became the first "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in rural areas in Ningxia, and also the demonstration hall of intangible cultural heritage protection in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Palace, the Guyuan District of Guyuan City has emerged more than 120 cultural palaces, 79 private performances groups, including some large-scale cultural palaces with more than 50, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Palace, Wang Yonghong Cultural Palace, Janang Cultural Palace, etc., covering all the townships and streets of the original state districts, the participants reached more than 5000.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses, and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better, the traditional culture cannot fall off like this."
"Liou's Battle Play" is back to "winning" look at Liu Yunlong Liquor opponent "play" - Xinhua Network
The 40th series of Battle Royale will be launched in Beijing on July 16.
The victories are based on the real history of the Soviet military archives that have been smashed for many years.
The actor Liu Yunlong, known as the "tragedy drama", broke through the image in the drama, and challenged a well-liked " mouth-watering agent".
In recent years, the redness of dramas such as Masks, Winds, proves that the type of war drama has a vigorous vitality.
Unlike the previous wars, victories look to the world, extending the background of the story to the Far East battlefield of the Soviet Union.
It follows the final stage of the war in 1944, telling the story of the secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the Secretary of the CPC Linhe Provincial Committee and the Secretary of the Soviet Union of the Far East Intelligence Agency, to carry out the "Mudanura" plan of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In many stunt dramas, the actor as a senior spy, one appearance is the perfect image of humor, high intelligence, mature.
But in Liu Yunlong's opinion, such a person is not suitable for spying, 'Spies should be such a putter in the pile of people can't find any, if a scene is such a dress very polite image, hate not everyone should pay attention to you, can also be able to invigorate? 'The wind slug' in a sentence, 'Don't catch me, I forgot to be a national party', spy to elite.'
Therefore, in the book of fortune, Liu Yunlong thoughtfully made his role as the master of the Tang Dynasty design as a "satisfying" mouth-watering agent.
The other side of the victories in the victories is supported by the Japanese actor Furuhara and Li Liquor as the chief of the police room.
A north-south two-pronged trenchbone adds a lot of high-end trenchholes to the whole play.
Director Yan flying with the word "tragedy" describes the drama of Li Lichun and Liu Yunlong's rival game, "It's definitely a tragedy, they are two very special tacit, this tacit relationship on them is very powerful for me. Many times their games are 'current', such as we only write half-page length, I don't stop when shooting, they can play."
When the actors are in the role and ensure their own character status, not only from the person's point of view to shape the role, but also to bring more viewing possibilities to the audience.
In the drama, you can also see a lot of familiar faces in the "Liou's Battle Drama", the famous earthquake in the "Window", the "Mountain City F4" in the "Window", also gathered three in the "Window".
The left arm of Tang-Fai was once shown as Hou Yu and Liu Ming-yang, which is also shown as the right arm of Tang-Fai.
"These two people are not degenerative, they are only in that era, and in that environment," the director introduced.
Liu Yunlong also proposed, "We want people to be human. This human touch means that the people around me must be good and bad, the bad people are the enemy, but also to develop them, our team must grow up as well."
The two sides of the play are also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believes that will give the audience a satisfactory response.

From the first half of the prosecutor's case, involving fraud and crime a large number of, up to the national macro-policy, down to the people's clothing and food, including the epidemic fraud, "medical" fraud, "health care" fraud, "entertainment" fraud, "rapid lending" fraud, fraud national subsidies fraud, national assets depreciation fraud, etc., continue to "innovation", which covers education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land deprivation, precision poverty reduction, financial credit and other fields, not only to the victims of economic losses, but also seriously affect the economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network fraud to break through the boundaries of the national, regional and personnel limitations, with the public, cross-border, remote, electronic payment and other characteristics, not specific groups of victims, harmful.
If there is a special company to set up, rent a high-grade writing tower, set up multiple departments or posts, use the legal network platform publicity, recruitment, training and evaluation of the recruiters, the use of business operation mode management, cover the "legal outerwear", more confusing.
In accordance with the law to cure and prevent crime, in a timely manner to the public and the relevant departments, is the responsibility of prosecutors.
In the judicial case, prosecutors seriously perform their responsibilities, both uphold the fraud crime to maintain high pressure, but also targeted to refine the various enforcement measures, through the issuance of prosecution recommendations to promote social governance.
Prosecutors strictly apply the facts, evidence, procedural matters and laws to arrest and prosecute fraud cases, based on the facts, the law as an excuse, to do so in vain.
In particular, for telecommunications network fraud, focus on the core role of electronic data in the fact-finding, efforts to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, word-tested evidence, and certificate.
As a matter of fact, the prosecutors of Yinzhou District of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, should be involved in a case of epidemic fraud, the prosecutors at the first time in advance, from the case to the conclusion, only five days, reflecting the fast from the strictness, to maintain the stability of society attitude and determination.
In the review of the arrest and review of the prosecution section, pay attention to the case's leaking prosecution work, correct the public security organs leaked 733 people, and correct the public security organs missed the review of the prosecution of 1113 people.
In the first half of the year, the National Procuratorate issued a procuratorial proposal for fraud crimes, to promote joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes, and promote deep-level governance.
For example, for communication enterprises, banks, intermediaries, etc. found in telecommunications network supervision loopholes, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, Dongguan City, the Procuratorate proposed in a timely manner, urge the relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote long-term efficiency system construction.
The fourth is to do all the hard work to restore the damage.
Prosecutors from all over the world arrested for intervening in investigations to guide the investigations, review the prosecution and other important aspects of the investigations, and urged the investigation agencies to actively pursue the funds, with the relevant departments to carry out the pursuit of loss work, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud and crime to the people.
If the Beijing Procuratorate handles a forest loan case, the case involves 22 suites waiting to be closed, in the case of property may be pre-processed by other cases, the first to issue the "Suspension Letter", timely delivery to the relevant court, it is recommended that the previous lockdown court on the case to suspend the implementation, the criminal facts to find out the unified disposal, in order to recover the case property, recover the loss of the victim.
Prosecutors remind you that fraud should be highly vigilant, do not expect to "drop pies in the sky", and do not think that it is cheap and easy to trust, keep your own "money bag".
Wenning County, Guizhou Province: Dwarf Apple Tree Widens the Poverty Line - New Internet
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source:China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yan-Jing
China's Economic Journal-China Economic Network reporters travel to the village of Nanhai, Wenning County, Guizhou Province.
On the day of the shooting, the villagers, Li Yuanzhong, were in the base of the moustache, although the face was bright, but from time to time sang a few songs in their mouths.
Weining County, where the town is located, due to its low splendour, high altitude, abundant light, large temperature difference at night, the apples have high sugar content, good taste, has a certain popularity in the surrounding area, but also because of the small size, there are many spots, has not been able to sell a good price, can not form the size of the industry.
Shanna Town was once a poor town in the "bogu taro pudding spring" and the local poverty rate was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
In a critical period of decisive battle against poverty, change the traditional cultivation habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase farmers' income is imminent.
After a number of visits, Chen Chao and a group of people in the town believe that the development of the industry can no longer take the old road.
For this reason, the town has introduced dragon enterprises and modernized the planting of apples.
In 2015, Weining went beyond the general manager of agriculture Co., Ltd. Hu Jianwen came to the town from Shaanxi to study, at a glance, looking at the local planting conditions, from 2016 to the local planting of apple trees.
At first, the village mobilized mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land out of the planted apple trees, Li Yuanzhong husband and wife both made a grudge: "So many years of apples, you can't see who in the village made apples."
"All the apples are drip apples, and they don't make the apple trees grow too much."
Let Lee Yuanzhong remember that this apple plant adopts a new method, the irrigation water pipe lay under each apple tree, water and fertilizer together to the root, the autumn harvest, the tractor directly into the fruit garden, standing can pick up the fruit.
At present, Apple base has gradually entered the proliferation period, the market is also as expected of Hou Jianwen, Apple is not sad, by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other urban consumers like.
The growing Apple industry has made a new change in Lee Yuanzhong's life, although it is still in the countryside, but there is a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong family has more than 9 transfer land to apple base, in addition to the bottom of the land transfer fee, after hanging fruit there is also a profit, both husband and wife in the base workers, "one person can get $80 per day, year-round active.
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profits were more than 2800, plus the land transfer fee and labor income of both husband and wife, one income more than 80,000, "Don't worry, Xiaohong's days are already gone."
"At this point, we have seen results, with an annual output of more than 1.5 million yuan, about 10 times the size of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town has planted 20,000 apples, only 6000 cubits in the middle of China village, covering the farmers 4056 households, 1.72 million people, including the establishment of the card poverty household 656 households, 2952 people, the salary paid more than 6 million yuan a year, the real implementation of the base construction at home door, work do not need to go out.
Li Yuanzhong, who is constantly blowing up his waist bag, has also begun to achieve his "will."
This year's Lunar New Year, Lee Yuanzhong bought a cross-country car, and now he's out of the car every day. "There are more than a dozen land in the house, waiting for the next Apple base to expand the scale, all transferred to them, more income."

Membrane Separation Technology Helps Crack the "Temperature Effect" - China New Network
Membrane separation technology helps to crack the "temperature effect"
New hybrid membrane preparation technology diagram
In this press release, reporters from Tianjin University said: Atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made major progress in the "diaphragm separation method capture carbon dioxide", and successfully developed a new hybrid substrate preparation technology, greatly improving the CO2 capture performance of film materials.
The results have been published as a cover article in the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the cause of the greenhouse effect.
How to efficiently capture and utilize CO2 emissions from humans is the focus of scientists.
"Membrane Separation Method" is an emerging CO2 capture technology, it helps to separate CO2 gas with the help of membrane materials, with efficient energy saving and simple operation characteristics.
How to "deep breath" membrane material, improve the efficiency of gas separation, is the use of membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide bottle difficult point.
Tianjin University research team innovative ideas, through repeated experiments, to explore the effect of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance.
The results of the experiment showed that N-methylpyrrolidone as a preparation solvent, the production of membrane material carbon nanotube distribution is more homogeneous, "more breathable", effectively improve the membrane material gas separation performance and rate.
With this new technology, the mixed matrix membrane, carbon dioxide separation performance is close to the theoretical maximum separation of such membrane materials.
"New technology provides new ideas for membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide."
"We hope that this technology will provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to deal with tobacco, and will play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions," said Li Yun, member of the team at Tianjin University.
I want to know what is the difference between a professional and a social network.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source:Rebirth of the Morning News Author:Yu Yu ResponsibilitiesEdit:Yu Yu
Let's get started before we know what a professional is.
Each year to fill in the college's volunteer, there are students or parents because of the lack of understanding of the words involved in the volunteer report, and thus affect the volunteer report.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing Philatelic University, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing Chemical University 5 colleges and universities jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy, canceling the professional level difference.
What is the meaning of professional difference, what is the significance of volunteering?
There are three types of professional allocation
Experts remind that before filling out the volunteering, be sure to read the "Article of Admission" of the center school in detail to understand the college's admission rules, including the proportion of adjustments, professional allocation rules, etc.
Professional allocation rule refers to the three main ways of professional priority, priority score, professional level difference for professional admission.
The specific method used by high school students will be clearly defined in the Admissions Charter.
There are also a number of college admissions principles are overall priority, there is no level difference between professional.
In other words, the candidate in the range in accordance with the overall ranking, when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer score line, see whether the second professional volunteer score line, so until the entrance to the last professional volunteer, there is no level difference between professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional disparity", is the institution in the arrangement of the candidate's professional, according to one or several fractions published in the admissions charter, to determine the selection of different professional volunteers, this fraction is the "professional disparity".
That is, the college in the first professional volunteer and non-first professional volunteer ratio, the division of professional volunteer, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Assuming that the student junior high school A college, took 560 points, its professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, A college professional admission to implement professional level difference, the grade difference is 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 point.
In the professional allocation, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteers meet the professional admission requirements and the professional has a plan balance, then Xiaoming was admitted to the "computer" professional; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be reduced by 2 points, according to 558 points with the first professional volunteers to the "international trade" ranking, to determine whether the professional admission conditions; if still can not meet, the score is reduced by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the third professional volunteer "automatic" admission; if still can not meet, the score is reduced by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for the fourth professional admission, the subsequent professional if still can not meet its professional enthusiasm, will not be reduced, so.
The differences between the different universities
With the popularity of parallel volunteerism, many colleges and universities have canceled the professional level difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method, from the publication of the "Article of Admissions", this year there are mainly more than 20 universities set the professional level difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Aviation Academy, etc.
The professional level of each of these colleges is different.
Some colleges and universities have different grades in each profession, such as Ningxia University, files have been put into the school of the candidates, according to the students to fill in the order of professional volunteers in order to reduce by 1 points, and then in the order of scores.
Some universities have different degrees of expertise.
For example, Jimei University, the total value of professional volunteer level is 4 points, that is, the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer level is 3 points, other professional volunteers do not have a level difference, as a parallel volunteer, other professional volunteer and adjuster professional volunteer level is 1 point.
Fill in the voluntary, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school, to see if there is no professional grade difference, the form of the difference is what, in the full consideration of the score, but also a reasonable analysis of the selected schools and professions, if the university in the admissions charter clear take a score difference method for admission, candidates in the selection of a professional, pay attention to the degrees between the various professions, improve the admission rate.

On July 25, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the HKSAR Government, Mr Edward Yau, said that all APEC economies should act in concert to fight against the virus and promote economic recovery, and should avoid unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations of the World Trade Organization.
Mr Yau said he would like to take part in a video conference on the COVID-19 pandemic held by the Trade Minister of Asia-Pacific (APEC).
At this meeting, the Secretary-General exchanged views with the APEC on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the substantive solutions that could be taken to promote economic recovery in the region.
Mr Yau said the pandemic-induced public health and economic crisis has had an unprecedented impact on society and the economy.

We want to make it clear that viruses are our common enemy in order to cooperate in order to win, and on the contrary will only fail."
Mr Yau said that a series of trade restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic did not help to control the epidemic.
Trade is the key to solving current problems and should not be regarded as a problem.
He denounces all discriminatory and segregated policies and urges all economies to remain open to the border at this critical moment, maintaining the smooth operation of the supply chain, avoiding the establishment of trade barriers or the adoption of irrational trade policies.

Police stop people from "looking too happy"
As a response to the United States' close of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, the Chinese announced on Friday that the US Consulate General in Chengdu was shut down.
On Saturday, the U.S. consulate badge was removed, and on Sunday, a dark-glass car took off the consulate in the noise of the passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people gathered to take pictures in front of the US consulate, and those who had not come to take a look before due to the curiosity of the current situation.
The reporters from the Faxinshe Chengdu station also went to the United States Consulate near Chengdu to observe the first, and returned the message that the curious, there are still many parents with children to take a walk to see the Consulate, to take a photo of the building, or selfie.
The consulate was surrounded by security guards, as the police sometimes "knock" the people's behavior, and they seemed not to allow any behavior to appear: a woman had just begun to sing red songs, and a guard had not received a line.
But the residents of a residential building nearby successfully raised a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted for support for China's slogan.
The Consulate of the United States of America of Chengdu opened in 1985, covering all U.S. consular affairs in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.

At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States is also in China, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong Consulate.
