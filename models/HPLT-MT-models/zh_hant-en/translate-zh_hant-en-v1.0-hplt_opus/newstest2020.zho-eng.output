Women's row is expected to defend the World Cup in advance!
On the 27th, in the match against the Dutch women's row, the Chinese team in the win-win situation of the two games, finally to the 3:1 lek Holland, to meet nine consecutive wins.
The World Cup is nearing its end, but despite the victory, China's female row is still unstoppable in the face of the Serbian team.
With the first two matches of the Netherlands, the performance of Chinese women row as always strong, to 25:19, 25:16, respectively, two cities, until the third game, the team encountered setbacks.
The Dutch women in the back row strengthened the attack of the ball, the Chinese team was passed by the impact, coupled with the girls to attack the heart, and the error began to increase, and finally 21:25 was hit by the opponent to return to a city.
In an interview, Sai Sherping also pointed out: "The third part, because of the error we sent about 8 points."
Of course, the Dutch women's row strength can not be underestimated, and the Chinese women's row also made difficult preparation before the race, although lost a game, but everything is still in the hands of Langping, " and the strength to win the game is normal, playing the game is also normal, so we said to the team members to focus," Langping said.
The fourth game, the team members actively adjust the state, Zhang always prefers to open the fire on the attack side, the single game gets 8 points, for the team to win the big victory.
To date, there are only two rounds left for the 11 rounds of the competition, the Chinese women's row, although one hand has touched the championship trophy, but in the match against the Dutch team really sounded a bell to the Chinese women's row: the more critical moments, the more you have to make the most of it.
In another match on 27th, Russia and the United States finished 5 games, the United States team failed to take a third from the opponent, so that Chinese women in the match against Serbia to take a third, can advance a round of defending.
There is a growing trend in women's rights in China.
However, although the six main points of the Serbian squad are not well known, this does not mean that they will easily send three points to the Chinese squad.
In the form of the current standings, the Serbian team has already basically unflinching medals, which means that they can put down the package to full impact on their opponents in the competition against the Chinese women's row, while the Chinese team is under the pressure to win the crown, and the state may, in turn, rise and fall.
In addition, the replacement of the Serbian team is not a "man-made slaughter" of the lamb, before and in the service of the Dutch team, the two sides of the war 5 bureau, Serbia II finally 3:2 reversed the Netherlands' full main strength, so that it can see the depth of its strength.
Before the start of the third stage of the game, Langping also said that both the load and the two teams are not good to deal with: "The match in Osaka will be very difficult, we should be as always, very prepared."
The corner of the crown is now blowing, and the game is really into the "white heat phase."
On the strength of the argument, Chinese female row is above the opponent, but only the last important head, but also to see whether the female row girls can play a normal level, in the field to try to release themselves.

However, if the hero is walking on the side, it seems like you are like me.
Yuan Longping, submerged rice research, cultivated a good variety of cultivation world, let billions of people do not have the risk of starvation, gongma, this wengping time is also like a favorite in the field head of the elderly farmers; Nan Ren East, be careful to let China's "Sky eye" angry chief scientist, a person, a lifetime, a mouth, life, life only one thing, in Guizhou deep mountain, cold head, and the old Han two things in the family life, Zhou Yuchang, a late village children, to still like a child, learn the West, on the top of a booming white hair, said to ask the meeting place, like to laugh, Qin Yi, the half-day film artist, even 90 years, for playing in the plate plate plate plate every day, ...
They seek kindness, live a life of Parmesan and pure, as long as they are immersed in the foreign people do not understand and their own precious career, it is easy to live fast, do not care about the fame and honor.
Like the monastery of Jin Yong, the monastery of Shaolin Temple, although surprised by the martial arts, does not shine, does not regret, does not regret.
Each "song of the sage", each of the cripples of the heart, behind the back of my home country, is responsible for who I am.
The country is not only carrying on the shoulders of heroes, but also carrying on the palms of millions of people.
Once, a female middle school student was madly converted by netizens. "When a hero passed away, there was always someone sitting by the way ... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a man sitting by the way."
In fact, when a hero and a hero are applauded, it is not contradictory.
The people on the road are also transmitting heat and light, and they are also emitting light.
Ordinary like you, like me, there are always some opportunities in life, some moments, there is a day and month accumulation, but also to shape the hero's model.
The outstanding judge of Shanghai, Hanbihua, shouldered the heavy duty of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting let the lecture room teacher to talk about his own story, a year to send numerous newspaper letters, from error-free, "to do simple things, is not simple,", Hanbihua led the judges to hand the voice to the "swimming monastery" of the old collection.
It's a pity that this is a hero, and a hero is applauded by another hero.
There are Shaolin Buddhist Temples, Yuan Longping has rice experiment field, Nan Ren East has "the sky eye", Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Yuchang has a forum...... Can you be a hero, not only rely on your own efforts, but also have a good environment and positive incentives.
For example, "China Eye" is now a myth.
In the '90s, the Chinese science and technology world was still struggling to climb, and the novelist Liu Cixin has not written "triple body" yet.
At that time, the cow's "eye" was a single-faced radio telescope in the Puerto Rico Valley, the U.S.A. - Aresibo, with a diameter of 350 meters, considered the world's largest "not to go beyond".
At the time, the Chinese radio telescope was less than one-tenth of a household.
And while enjoying world-class scientific research and salary in Japan, Nanrendong insists on returning home, bringing back a nearly crazy idea: to build a new generation of radio telescope in China, to receive more information from outer space!
China's hundreds of years of waiting, is it worth investing big money to play the stars?
The country's trust in South Ren'an, "the sky eye" project opened.
The site has been used for 12 years and the project has been completed for 9 years.
The 500m diameter of the "Sky Eye" opened, China has made a "one-of-a-kind large scientific project" without precedent.
So, the "Heavenly Eye" is amazing, the South Africans are amazing, and there is a large, distant Republic.
With the trust of the state and the goodwill of the people, the South Africans have the mechanism to become the liver of the soul of the people of the country.
There are young talents and white-haired heroes who have gone away, and the people on the road gently applause, such a country, very nice and harmonious.
Garbage classification education first in Jilin kindergarten environmental protection concept from the doll

After years of effort, the provinces and municipalities have the ability to dispose of household waste in a non-harmful manner.
The "Jilin Province Promotes Urban Living Garbage Treatment Program" clearly requires in-depth garbage classification into the campus, teaching materials, into the classroom and other activities, through the creation of garbage classification songs, songs, comics, micro-videos and other works, to enhance the interaction between students and parents, to achieve the effect of "education of a child, affecting a family, bringing a community, and building a new generation of new people".

Heraklion's political legacy
On 26th, former French President Jacques Chirac passed away at the age of 86.
In the midst of a century of unprecedented change in the world, the French politician still deserves our praise.
He has served as President of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He has inherited the spirit of independent diplomacy and firmly supports the integration of Europe and is the representative character of chasing the European dream.
At the same time, he also advocates for global polarization and multilateralism, and is a strategic politician.
The French media said he was "a prominent representative of France on the world stage."
Heraklion's political decision was against the US-led Iraq War.
Under his leadership, France joined forces with Germany to put pressure on the United States to fight back.
One year after the outbreak of the war, he predicted that the Iraq war would cause the terrorist activity to increase and make the world more dangerous.
Heraklion's warnings are correct.
In the context of European integration into the looming, the more unilateralism in the United States, the more prominent today, herak has undoubtedly strong inspiration for the strategic thinking and choice of international political and global affairs.
Heraklion is a French politician who is known and loved by Chinese people.
He is one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Decade" of Chinese-French relations. After the first election of the French President in 1995, he will promote the rapid development of Chinese-French relations with a strategic perspective of politicians.
In 2004, China Law established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and China Law bilateral exchanges entered a new stage.
During the Shirak administration, China's bilateral trade between the two countries has grown rapidly, and the two countries have made breakthrough progress in cooperation in various fields such as aviation, nuclear energy, railway transport and so on.
The year of the Chinese-French culture proposed by Shirak created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of Chinese-French.
Heraklion has always been particularly impressed with the Chinese culture.
According to his introduction to Chinese diplomats, Herac can back away some poems from Li Bai and Du Fu, and can even accurately determine the history of Chinese bronze instrument.
"Don't look at the pyramid, it's not really going to Egypt, it's not going to China" - the golden word comes from Herac.
In an interview with news reporters from Xinhua, Shirak said: "The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological issues arising from China's economic growth and China's international political position.
I am very confident in China.
I think China has a long history of civilization, and its experience is sufficient to help it establish a harmonious development concept and values, and take responsibility for the long-term on the world stage.
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creativity to the world culture and enrich the world culture.
The people have gone, but the political heritage and inspiration Herac left to the world will survive with the world.

A joint statement issued by the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to strongly oppose the adoption of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the U.S. House of Representatives External Committees.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Basic Law provides the right to remain a free trade port and separate tariff zones in different fields of economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, etc.

The statement said that the U.S. Congress to attend the external committees of the two institutions to pass the motions of the relevant bill is not necessary, but only to respond to the call of its port agent, as a means of rough intervention in Hong Kong's internal affairs and as its agent for political checksuming in Hong Kong.
The U.S. Department of State expresses its deep regret for this decision.
Hong Kong is an important U.S. trade partner and the largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong has a good rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society, making it a good place for American business owners.
In addition to fighting against the interests of Hong Kong and the U.S. itself, the U.S.-China relations will also be frosted, without any benefits, damage to people.
The statement said that Hong Kong will continue to enjoy the rights granted by the Basic Law and fully fulfill its obligations, as always and without hesitation, to implement the "one country, two systems" policy.
Hong Kong will continue to contribute to the international community and international trade, whether in the past, present or future.

"If France would be able to accept (immigrate) properly, it would not accept everyone," Macron said.
Macron presents four key points to immigration policy: to provide asylum status to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; to promote immigration integration more efficiently; to receive and protect all immigrants entering the French territory; and to relocate illegally into France more efficiently and not to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance (AME) system is the topic that has been discussed the most before.
Macron said he wanted to be able to "evaluate" the system, but not cancel it, but make certain restrictions on it.
After Macron's release of this statement, the far-right "national alliance" leader tweeted that Macron's statement was "no talk."
The members of the right-wing Republican Party and the Senate President Rathel also said that immigration policies should be discussed in a "remittance" but "face to reality" way, and criticise Emron indirectly.
On immigration issues, left-wing social party member Varou believes that France should "have received more, better," and criticize Emmanuel Macron on the subject of "manipulating."
The new Asylum and Immigration Act has been promulgated for a year, which has led to disagreement within the political party, but has yet to refute the right-wing opposition.
In the next 2022 general election, the topic of immigration policy will again be the focus of the extreme right wing attack, Macron needs to do something on this issue, but will also take the risk of rage against left-wing people inside the party.
The French Parliamentary House will hold a debate on immigration policy from September 30, while the Senate will hold a debate on immigration policy from October 2.
There are signs that China A-shares are welcome to "buy back trend", and many listed companies have come out of the "real gold silver" to buy back the company's stocks.
According to the statistics of the financial data service provider Oriental wealth, as of 27 days, the total amount of repurchase of listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 10 billion yuan (RMB, the same lower), far more than the same period of the previous year, the number of repurchase funds of A-shares has been record high.
In response to this, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Micron Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said that the overall valuation of the A-shares market is lower this year, with a relatively low price to buy back shares, is conducive to the use of listed companies to improve the efficiency of capital utilization, but also shows the initiative to manage the market value of listed companies and abundant cash flow situation, is conducive to boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share buy-back system has also led to the active share buy-back of listed companies.
For example, at the beginning of this year, Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued the rules for the implementation of repurchase shares of listed companies, providing listed companies with detailed rules and guidelines for repurchase shares.
In addition, according to media statistics, since this year, it has implemented a repurchase plan for listed companies mainly focused on the infrastructure industry, real estate industry, information technology industry and electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, from the point of view of the repurchase payment, there are six listed companies repurchased more than 10 billion yuan this year.
Among them, the first is the Erie shares, whose repurchase amount is more than $5 billion.
What is the impact of repurchase of shares of a listed company on the market?
On the one hand, the repurchase indicates that the listed company has a stronger economic strength and better financial status, the ability to maintain stock price stability, confidence to investors; on the other hand, it also shows that the listed company and its controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, the market responsibility and the investors responsible for consideration.
The former is established in the company's good business performance, the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have a higher quality.
This is one of the most fundamental elements of capital markets.
The repurchase of shares of listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the stock price of listed companies.
In addition, according to the Oriental Securities Research Report, according to the overall estimated number of shares repurchased by A-shares since the beginning of this year, and the average price of shares repurchased, this year's repurchase of stocks for A-shares market brought the incremental funds expected to exceed 15 billion yuan.

In 1986, Wang Baixiang served as the deputy director of Shouguang County, Shandong Province, at that time, Shouguang was a poor county in Wufang.
In the five years he served, Wang Baixiang was the heart of the people, and focused on three things: first, to promote the industrialization of vegetables; second, to develop Shoubei salt sand beach; and third, to lay the foundation for the industrial turn, so that the Shouguang people from this drum up their pockets, raised the waist plate.
Fresh vegetables have traditional traditions, as well as vegetables.
In the early '80s, the farmer's vegetable abundance was not sold, it was scattered in the ground.
Wang Baixiang research found that the key to picking vegetables is good circulation.
Shouguang was the first to build a vegetable wholesale market, which opened the beginning of the development of the market economy.
The members of the party were smashed, and all the soldiers in the county were killed.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Baixiang, 17 members such as Sanyuan Zhucun Wang Yueyi, etc., played 17 winter-heated vegetable sheds, which in the same year the village made 17 "two million yuan households".
After the county set up a promotion team, under the mobilization of Wang Baixiang, Wang Leyi in various townships tour guide; the first year of the promotion of more than 5000 vegetable sheds, then the vegetable sheds such as Yuyuan to the whole county and even the country.
For hundreds of thousands of years, Shoubei's 1.6 million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-million-m
The local population is suffering.
There is a vegetable shed in Shounan, and it is located in Shoubei.
Wang Baixiang organized tens of thousands of people to take part in the general battle, and camped on a deserted beach, one of which was forty-five days.
Wang Baixiang and the leading cadres of the county were eating on the jobsite, as if they were driving the car, the wind meal, the people saw them all stretched their thumbs, and their eyes admired ... At that time, Shoubei developed a 15 million cubic meters pool, two million cubic meters salt field, six million cubic meters of cotton field, and developed a "gazing treasure pot" on the salt beaches.
In July 1986, Wang Baixiang participated in the Zhangfang Municipal Industry Conference for the first time as a county secretary.
During the meeting, a "Zhangfang City Twelve County Municipal Industrial Economic Digital Contrast Table" was issued. At first glance, the value of the industrial gross product, Shouguang was right, ranked fourth.
But if the salt is removed, the pure industrial output of Shouguang is only $119 billion, which is the third in the countdown.
Wang Baixiang with more than 70 recruits, went to the field to "change the brain".
In less than a year, the county has invested $1.5 billion and over 77 projects.
Since then, every year, the organization of "passover group", to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai and other places.
Short-lived businesses with less business owners.
Wang Baixiang held a special theme auction board: in the county's public election plant manager, 40 "good people" out of the spotlight, was pushed to the forefront of the industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the top 100 counties in the country, and Wang Baixiang re-elected as Deputy Mayor of Zhangfang City.

Wang Yi proposed to strengthen cooperation between the two sides in the Security Council.
First, the strength of unity.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, the direct consequences are the basic principles of international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is impacted, damage to the interests of the vast development of Chinese and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To cope with this challenge, it is necessary to hold hands, shoulder to shoulder, and unite to have strength.
In the Council, the three African countries speak in one voice, focusing on not just three votes, but the entire continent.
China and Africa stand together, not only 4 votes, but other countries will follow, affect and shape the agenda of the Council.
Since 2018, the African members of the United Nations Security Council of China have established a "3+1" coordinating mechanism to make full use of this coordinating mechanism.
Second, the negotiation of disputes.
China has been advocating political solutions to hot issues, a well-established tradition of consultation in Africa, and a successful success of African and sub-regional organizations.
Many of the complex problems of the symposium are especially in Africa's hot spots, mostly the root of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We want to work together on Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play a role in merging and mediation.
Third, self-sufficiency.
African countries and people are most aware of African issues, and African countries have the ability to intelligently solve their own problems.
When dealing with Africa's hot issues, the Security Council should focus on listening and respecting Africa's will, and should play the role of regional and sub-regional organizations, and should encourage and support indigenous solutions from Africa.
China would like to strengthen coordination with non-federal parties, and strongly promote the development of the capacity of independent and peaceful action in Africa.
Fourth, relying on the fundamental development of governance.
China and the majority of African countries are developing China, we must adhere to putting economic and social development first, and support each other's choice of development path.
China would like to build a "Belt and Road" with the African Union's 2063 Agenda, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the African countries' development strategy closely linked to help African countries enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We look forward to working together to increase the United Nations' investment in Africa.
The outbreak of the Congolese Ebola outbreak has once again erupted, and the Chinese government has continued to provide full assistance to provide the human resources and material assistance that can be reached, and will cooperate with the African countries to coordinate action, mobilize the United Nations, World Health Organization and other increased assistance, and play a good role in the United Nations Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Trudeau's "people collapsed," and he could also succeed in re-election.
This is the "big hole" behind Trudeau's head, which is a little excavated by Trudeau himself.
Recently, Canadian media contact revealed a number of old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau dressed himself as a black figure.
This is considered to be an obvious racism, which sparked a massive wave in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
The Canadian economy, however, did not pay taxes.
Trudeau smashed his foot.
Since the rise of the "Anti-Black Face Movement" from the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been advocating that the opposition party or the party within the party hold differing opinions in this regard "partially outrageous," as noted by political commentator Leslie and others, and repeatedly said, "whoever makes this mistake should be immediately removed."
Simply put, the Trudeau "Big Pit" is a little bit of Trudeau's own excavation.
Trudeau is the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau of Canada, a young handsome man who had scratched a "political idol" cyclone just before his debut.
Originally a "political vulture", he succeeded the Federal Liberal Party, and played an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 Federal Legislative Election - a Federal Liberal Party that seats more than half of its seats in the Federal Lower Chamber, gaining a valuable independent royal power.
At that time, Trudeau proposed a number of revitalization policies and ideas, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "eco-environmental" and "economic revitalization", emphasising the suppression of corruption and "unfair wind".
However, after five years of administration, he was at the top of almost all of the above, "Go high and low."
For the issue of "ethnic and gender equality", he left out the "black face" incident, which he said in a series of questions about indigenous peoples, so that in the days of the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada's indigenous groups and leaders, the protest tents were moved to the gate of the Capitol Hill.
When it comes to preventing corruption, at the beginning of last year, Trudeau was in the midst of the boisterous "Lanwan Ling Event".
It was revealed that the construction engineering company "lanwanlin" in their own country was a major violation of private fraud, pressured the department and officials responsible for the investigation, and asked the latter to " raise your hand".
In addition, Trudeau was angry at the official of the disclosure of the fraud - Wang Zhoudi, mentioned earlier, was the first to disclose the fraud, when he directly conducted the case as the Attorney General of Canada.
Although the case itself is still questionable, its suspicions are difficult to wash.
Many observers pointed out that Trudeau's five-year executive collapsed, mainly due to its own "hanger", and the largest "hanger" is too much of the "huge snake tail", "self-providing results" and "obedient to the law, strictly the lawman."
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Redeminent data show that since 2015, respondents who supported Trudeau have slipped from more than 60% to more than 30%, while opponents have risen from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Even though other opposition parties and their party leaders do not perform well, even a considerable portion of the voters who are still willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now unconvincing about the Federal Prime Minister and the ruling party leader.
On October 21, a new federal election in Canada is about to begin, and will Trudeau be able to re-enter the show that he won five years ago?
The answer can be one word: difficult.
Whether it is from the competitive level of the enterprise, the consumer experience level, or from the integration of regional aviation, the development of the integration of Jingjin, has a profound and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially launched.
According to the Beijing Reform Commission, the capital airport has been overrun and operational status, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the service capacity of the capital aviation.
After Shanghai, Beijing became China's second with the city with two airports, and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport service mainly in domestic aviation affairs, Pudong International Airport is mainly similar to international air transport, the future capital airport and Daxing Airport will also serve different domestic and international aviation business positioning, to provide more detailed services.
From the point of view of business development, it has more positive impact on the capital airport.
In 2018, the capital airport exceeded 100 million passenger throughput, ranked first in the country, but compared to the rapid growth of business needs, there is still a clear lack of capacity, especially international flight needs have a greater gap.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel and other needs, to meet the growing open Beijing and international urban development trend, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, planning to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million people, four million tons of mail throughput.
Therefore, the two airports are not heavy, respectively for different customer groups, but also have enough market space.
From the economic accounting point of view, Daxing International Airport, obviously will form a win-win effect, reduce the tension situation of Beijing aviation, speed up the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and build the capital aviation double-nuclear operation of incremental cake.
From the user's point of view, with Daxing International Airport, the future does not have to focus on the capital airport to travel, but also can reduce the route too concentrated brought by a series of problems, such as the length of station guarantee, passengers boarding slower, indirectly increase the aircraft and passengers stay at the airport, exacerbating the burden of the airport operation, through the capital airport shipping down, but also improved the passenger experience.
According to the calculation of the time and cost of a variety of transportation routes to large international airports, such as the high-speed express of Beijing Kaixing Airport from the Nanwu ring, 50 minutes by car, oil money back about 40 yuan, high-speed 15 yuan, while the choice of rail transit rail Daxing Airport line, the distance is based on the distance of 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers, the price is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan, the public can also take the Jingxicheng Intercity, from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport station only 20 minutes.
Overall, there are a variety of transportation options available at the airport, and the cost and time are also within a more reasonable range.
And from the trend of development perspective: Daxing Airport is positioned as a traffic hub in Beijing, so distance from Beijing area is a bit far, but strengthen the radiation on Hebei, Tianjin, to facilitate more people to travel, the lifting of Hebei, Tianjin economic development is of great significance.
In the future, passengers in Hebei and Tianjin can enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, which can be seen from Daxing Airport's transportation planning.
The supporting transportation facilities of Daxing Airport are very complete, in addition to the new airport line of Beijing District directly to Daxing Airport, there are also a number of highway joint Daxing Airport and the surrounding area.
This is similar to the cities of Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities, you can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport by Guangfu, GuangDong and other highways, and other residents of Beijing surrounding Langfang, Xi'an New District and other places will also benefit from Daxing Airport, access to convenient and efficient aviation services.
It can be seen from this that the international airport, not only increased several runway and several aircraft, whether it is from the competitive level of the enterprise, the consumer experience level, or from the regional aviation integration, the development of Beijing Ji Ji integrated level, all have a profound impact and positive significance, not only about the long-term layout and development of the Beijing Ji's large-scale residents to provide a diversified choice for Beijing Ji's travel, promote the quality of Beijing shipping services to further improve, more conducive to the integration of Beijing Ji's development process, and promote the economic and trade development around the airport.
Therefore, for the sailing of the Daxing Airport, we are not only economically accounting for individual small accounts, but also for the overall development of the big accounts.

The 2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Forum was held in the province of Zengshun
Mr. Yuen, Deputy Director of the Economic Commission of Vietnam, revealed that at the beginning of this year, the economic and social development of Vietnam showed a lot of new colors and continued to grow.
The forum focuses on the economic and social issues highlighted in the past few months and proposes measures for economic and social development in late 2019 and 2020.
On the forum, delegates exchanged views and opinions on the impact of the economic development in 2019 and some free trade agreements, some prominent issues of the Vietnam economy in 2019, prominent issues of the Vietnam social culture in 2019, and the projections and recommendations of the economic and social development in 2020.
In the first few months of 2019, global economic growth has slowed, increased risk and challenges.
Trade friction between major economies has led to a further shrinking of global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), while the global economy is full of uncertainty, 70% of the world's economy falls into a growth stoppage state, but Vietnam's economic development has made many satisfactory achievements, macro-economic stable operation, inflation has been effectively controlled, and the consumption price index of residents in the first half of 2019 has increased by 2.64 percent, creating the lowest increase in the last three years.
The GDP growth in the first half of 2019 was 6.76%, though 7.05% lower than the same period last year, but the growth was still higher compared to the level of the same period in 2011-2017.
When predicting the economic development trend of Vietnam in 2019-2020, the Deputy Director of the Vietnam National Economic and Social Forecasting Center Dun Deying said that in the context of the world economic turmoil, the Vietnam economy showed a higher growth momentum in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, the Vietnam macro economy will continue to remain basic and stable, the implementation of various FTA agreements will promote trade development, economic structure adjustment, business environment improvement work has been further strengthened, due to the impact of trade friction, Vietnam's export activities will be shown a downward trend.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring of the forecast warning mechanism, to proactively find trade relief measures for Vietnam export goods, to find opportunities to expand the new export market, and to create convenience for exports of a variety of goods such as agricultural and water products.
At the same time, the inflation rate is controlled at a reasonable level, with this to promote the industrial development, support the development of high-tech agriculture, organic farming and ecological agriculture.

A Decade of Witnessing China's Digital Clouds in a Small Town - New China News
If you put the 2009 local website forum as the starting point, the 2019 Yunba Conference held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 has been going for a full decade.
From the concept of "cloud," to the practice of "cloud," big data, cloud computing in 10 years has become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management, public services.
In the Zhengtai new energy photovoltaic battery workshop located in Haining, Zhejiang, a number of recent quality inspectors have loaded a new "colleague" with Alibaba cloud artificial intelligence.
It is open 24 hours a day, the identification speed is more than twice as fast as the manual, and the quality inspection accuracy is more than 95% stable.
According to the company's responsible person, the "quality inspector" with the camera has focused on learning more than 40,000 defective samples, with the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images to binary language, the defective battery classification placed.
This company is just a reflection of today's cloud computing to help transform the manufacturing industry.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "promoting enterprise cloud implementation guide (2018-2020) ", and put forward in 2020, efforts to achieve a greater awareness and enthusiasm on the enterprise, the proportion of cloud and application depth has been greatly improved.
Alibaba Cloud founder Wang Jin said today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge for the digital economy, which is a key element of data.
Over the past 10 years, the size of our cloud computing industry has also expanded.
The China Institute of Information and Communications released the "Cloud Computing Development White Paper (2019)" in July this year, showing that in 2018, the overall market size of China cloud computing reached 962.8 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2 percent from 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology to support the transformation of the industry and the development of the digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has also changed the city management and social life inconspicuously.
At this year's cloud conference, the "city brain" that has been unveiled for three consecutive years is still attracting attention.
Today, the urban brain has become a hub for urban management from transportation management tools, and the application of related cooperation has been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through the camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain through a strong calculation ability, so that the "first stop after the payment" " Real-time perception of the number of patients " " " " " " tourism line design" and other new city management services functions can be achieved.
In the field of government services, the use of "one cloud" to connect "one thing", the "handheld office" "handheld work" together to promote, cloud computing for the provision of government services has brought convenience to both ends.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform throughout the province through political cloud.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 5700 million people living in the province and more than 15 million legal entities, with a collection of 3066 class 190.8 billion data.
The average monthly calls and sharing of data among government departments in Zhejiang Province reached 1.2 million times, and the data flowed on the 'cloud' more than once, which may mean that the mass of the operation of the running leg.
Pack tea with plastic tea carefully!
According to the central news agency, a recent study in Canada found that a bag of plastic tea bags may release billions, or even millions of plastic particles, significantly higher than the number of microplastics that a person has an estimated annual intake, but so far there is no evidence that the absorption of plastic particles will pose a threat to mankind.
According to researchers at the University of Magil, Canada, the plastic tea bags were immersed in a glass of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius), and the tea bags released about 116 million plastic particles and 31 million smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This number is significantly higher than the estimated number of microplastics taken by one person throughout the year.
According to the research released earlier in 2019, the average person consumes at least 50,000 plastic particles per year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
The study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology. Researchers tested the four different types of plastic business tea bags at Monteya stores and cafes, opening the tea bags, soaking in almost boiling water for 5 minutes, and then using electronic microscopes and spectrometers for analysis.
According to the study, they found that more than 116 million plastic particles were released in a single tea bag, “better than a few levels higher than plastic loads from previous other foods.”
Most tea bags are made of natural fiber, but many brands still use plastic to seal them.
Some brand tea bags are no longer paper-based, instead of plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the object of the researcher's testing.
Plastic particles are small pieces of plastic, and researchers define the size of these microplastics between 100nm and 5mm, mainly produced by plastic waste decomposition.
Microplastics can also be found in water, bottled water, fresh seafood and beer by researchers in the air, soil, river and deepest gaps around the world.
In October 2018, for the first time, plastic particles were found in human embroidery samples in several countries around the world.
In order to test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released by tea bags, the Canadian research team put fleas in contaminated water and found that microplastics could affect the behavior of these fleas and cause them to develop malignant conditions.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence that taking plastic particles pose a threat to humanity.
However, the WHO pointed out that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and how they affect humans.
Researchers have suggested that these tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles, which may be the contact between these plastic tea bags and boiling water, even when the "food grade" plastic heats up to 40 degrees Celsius, it may decompose or decompose toxic substances.
According to Guterres, climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There is a natural disaster that threatens the development of the next generation.
The disasters of Burda, Dominican Republic and the Bahamas since the hurricane attacks this year have shown this.
About a quarter of China's population lives at an altitude of 5 meters or less.
Relocation can seriously affect their social and lifestyle, and even cause problems with sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island countries are working together to achieve carbon-neutral and 100% renewable energy by 2030, leading the world in the right direction again.
"The climate crisis is heaping new injustices over the old injustices.
Despite the small island development of China's small contribution to global warming, it has paid the highest cost.
As these countries are in the middle-income position, many countries are also in the cycle of catastrophes and debt acceleration and unsustainable.
The world must take action and now it is time to make a big decision and invest heavily in the development of small islands in China."
Today's high-level conference adopted a political statement to seek assistance in the development of China's small islands to manage the risk of disaster, invest in climate-friendly infrastructure and the transformation of renewable energy; urge international institutions to help small islands to develop Chinese families, especially in debt-intensive middle-income countries to obtain funding.
China's small island development home is at the forefront of protecting and preserving the lifeline of the planet - the ocean.
This week's special report from the Special Commission on Climate Change confirms that the ocean has suffered the severe consequences of the climate crisis's "seat-by-eat".
By the middle of the century, a number of extreme sea level rise could occur every year.
The report warns that without a large amount of funding being invested in adaptation, some island states are likely to become unable to live.
Pollution, over-fishing and acidification caused huge losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, and in the past 40 years, plastic pollution has increased ten times.
The demand for industrial, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decrease in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many islands.
Small island countries are also facing high costs for transportation, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, making them subject to fluctuations in prices.
Some countries are also working to address the safety impacts of illegal trafficking in people, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: "By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, this problem can be solved anywhere.
Our efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with the tools, lessons and examples available to us all over the world.
He emphasized that the development of small islands in China is an example of sustainable development.
It requires long-term care and investment in the entire world.
The Ministry of Finance of India said the financial system was liquid enough.
India's Minister of Finance Sidraman said on the 26th that the current financial system is sufficiently liquid, and the growth of India's economy is expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by the demand for festive consumption.
West Talaman made the above statement after the meeting with representatives of private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and other institutions in India.
West Talaman did not explain the relevance of these statements.
Some of the former Indian media and overseas media have attributed the ongoing deceleration of India's current economy to the liquidity tensions of non-bank financial institutions.
West Talaman, for example, declined in auto sales, negates liquidity tensions as the main reason for the decline in sales.
West Talaman pointed out that the decline in car sales is mainly due to cyclical factors.
West Talaman expects India's economic growth to recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
India's annual shopping season starts in September and continues until the end of the year.
Consumer spending is expected to significantly increase the growth of India's economy.

"Over-age farmers on some sites are estimated to account for more than half.
Where are you looking for young workers?
There is no way to use so many 'old people' on the jobsite. '
Recently, for the phenomenon of many over-age farmers on the site (over the retirement age), long time in the construction of the construction contractor of the engineering contractor Dun Kui said.
Recently, the author is in the university of rainwater dispersion project, there are a lot of farmers in the campus, if you pay attention to the observation, you will find that there are a lot of over-age farmers here.
Over-age farmers workers are not "fun", but because "can't have fun", with "must be so" negativity and hard work - whether it's money to solve their own pension and medical problems, or to help their children, all these elderly people should continue to work hard.
The "old enough" of over-age peasants, is not as easy as we thought.
Raising children, raising seniors, reading books for children, helping children to buy a car, helping children to set up their own business, nurturing grandchildren, when these peasants have completed the "life mission", the bag has been empty even a lot of debt, most of them lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to deprive children, but also in order to accumulate some wealth for themselves, many farmers and workers adhere to the "strength to keep going".
Many '80 after', '90 after' and '00 after' new generation of farmers workers do not want to work in the conditions are hard, high labor intensity of the second industry or low-end service industry, resulting in structural 'work', these lack of attractive work, to provide opportunities for over-age farmers.
Due to the lack of a long skill, physical capacity and labor capacity have decreased, many over-age farmers have a strong, low income, high risk, and less protection.
Can take a day is a day, can make more is a little, "can not play" behind the survival of the over-age farmers, can not be ignored and ignored.
To solve the problems of unpaid and paid, improve the protection of labor, reduce the risk of safety, increase the income of labor, improve the survival status of over-age farmers, in addition to their "self-help", but also leave the system of public sector care and human concern.
Researchers have noted that over-age farmers are less likely to rely on homegrown farms to solve their own problems such as nursing and medical care, and they must adopt other ways to feed their families.
Read the "can't play" of over-age farmers, help us better understand the love and pain of over-age farmers.
Seeing the backs of over-age farmers, hearing their sighs, trying to get them back into the countryside, they really have to "always depend on the old", need public sector, market and society to share responsibilities in good interaction, need to work together.
"Russia will not export such a system in the next five years," Cémezov said, "because first of all, the supply of its own troops will only export production."
This practice is fully compliant with international practice.
The main manufacturers of weapons and military equipment are always the first to ensure the needs of their country before processing export orders.
In the early days, General Yuri Glehoff, deputy commander of the Russian Air Force, said the system's research work would be completed.
The S-500 system is developed by the "Diamond-Antai" sky defense Kangzen.
This is a new generation of air defense systems, using the working principle of the goal of destroying ballistic and air dynamics.
The S-500 is a medium-range ballistic missile that can be projected at a distance of 3500 km.
In addition, according to some information, the S-500 can destroy high-soul-fast cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, high-soul-fast missiles that exceed 5 times the sound speed, and even are located close to space targets.
This kind of weapon can also be integrated with other air defense systems as a unified network, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense point of view.
Sergey Chemezov expressed his particular concern about the S-400.
The system is currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic region.
S-400 air defense system into the Arctic air defense team.
According to the news on September 15, the work of the S-400 anti-air missile system was completed.
This is not the case in the Arctic region.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said that this is a process that is entirely in the direction of the North's more advanced defense tool transition program.
"With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable space in the Arctic region has increased significantly."
It is important to note that the use of the system in the Arctic and the North Pole has been very successful.
Air Force Officers were trained on the new system and prepared to enter the combat mission.
The S-300 is a remote air defense system that is still a part of the system.
When it comes to the air defense system, it must have a weapon that destroys a variety of air targets, whether it's a high-speed flight of the outer layers, or a "missing net fish" near the protected facilities.
According to the public sources, the S-400 ( Triumph) system developed by Gold Diamond-Antai is designed for attacking strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.

The competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and growing.
"We're ambitious and have launched 500 businesses through this store in three years," he said.
The platform is also available for Russian companies in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, professor of the Foundation for Trade Policy at the University of Prehanov, Russia, said: "This is a political project that represents the image of both sides because the Russian Export Center is a state-owned, not a private institution."

New York Times: We're not going to take our own path
China and the world in a new era, the white paper issued on 27, to answer: 70 years, China's development success, the fundamental reason is under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people found the Chinese characteristics of socialism the right way to develop and continue on this road unwaveringly.
China's ability to adapt to its own development path is the choice of history and the choice of the people.
In recent years, in the environment of poverty accumulation and internal and external concern, the generation of employees philosophers for the exploration of the path of salvation of the people of the country seek and go forward.
"The constitutional system of the monarchy, the dictatorship, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system, has been tried, and the results have not worked."
Until the Communist Party of China, with the new China, the Chinese people in practice gradually developed a socialist road with Chinese characteristics.
This road China walks out is the road of the Chinese people's happiness, the road of the Chinese people's renaissance, and the road of China's common development with the world.
It is because walking on the right path, China can do its own things, in order to become the world's second largest economy, the largest contribution to global economic growth, in order to continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As White Paper pointed out, China's road to development, in line with China's national conditions, to meet the requirements of the times, will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how easy it is to find the right path; look around the world, the Chinese people cherish the right path more.
The Chinese understand the truth of the North Orange, and understand that it is not necessarily suitable for others, but only for their own.
It is with this path of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created the wonder of the world.
In the process of human evolution, "the end of history" has been called a time of noise.
Today, the success of Chinese characteristics of the socialist road, declared the end of the "historical conclusion", "China collapsed" collapse, "socialism failure theory" failure.
China's success, to promote the development of China's strong confidence in the rich people, to expand the development of China's way to modernization, for the world who both want to accelerate the development and want to maintain their own independence of the country and people, to provide experience and study in line with the national conditions of the country.
The world is colorful.
China always respects the right of the country to choose the right path for its own development.
China does not "enter" the foreign model, nor "output" the Chinese model, but will firmly not move away from their own way, to achieve their own continuous development, with the countries to strengthen political exchanges, for the common good and good governance should contribute.
The Fair Work Commission found that a foodworks supermarket boss fired a 66-year-old female worker through text messages because he was more willing to hire employees from an Asian background.
The committee said that the boss of Gail Ayton, who has worked at the Wagga Wagga shop for more than 20 years, was "extremely unfair" to treat employees, and may violate the anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton said to the committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016, and he has been "wanting to smack me off" because she is not a Chinese.
In this case, Vice Chairman of the Board, Peter Sams, made a search on the Internet, and found that "Mr. Wang had previously posted some job advertisements at various Australian jobs forums."
Among the job requirements listed in these posts, one of them said "Preferred Asian Ladies" and the other said "Preferred Asian Employees."
The third post said he was "more inclined to foreigners (as in the original)."
Mr. Wang was fired from Ms. Ayton in April this year by text message, and later said it was due to her absence and a small amount of cash that was claimed to be missing from $5.10 to $30 from the cash register.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang's reason for dismissing Ms. Ayton was weak and lacked evidence.
In three years, she only missed one shift, and the amount of "missing amount" totaled a few dollars.
Ms. Ayton said she was fired from "actually have nothing to do with her behavior or performance."
He said: "In my opinion, with the support of Mr. Wang's recruitment advertisement, the defendant should dismiss her true motivation that he is more willing to hire employees with an Asian background.
Pursuant to Article 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct on the surface constitutes an offence against the anti-discrimination law and/or is unlawful for the dismissal of the applicant."
Mr. Sams said that due to Mr. Wang's treatment of Ms. Ayton's "discussed", it was not appropriate to consider restoring her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Mrs. Ayton, who is a temporary worker with an hourly salary of AUD26.
In view of the possible violations of discrimination and labor relations legislation, Sams said he would submit his rulings and documents to the Board of Directors to consider whether he should pass Mr. Wang's actions to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
Mr. Wang said he did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to claims that she had been fired.
He said: "I think the defendant should take an unfair and prejudicial procedure to dismiss the applicant, Mr. Wang "wait" for this opportunity, and he believes it is right to "prove" the termination of employment to the applicant."
"He's wrong... he should be totally disregarded when he leaves the applicant for any natural and fair treatment, and it's amazing that he's disrespectful and extremely unfair. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"Although Foodworks is a small business," Mr. Sams said, "but frankly, any decent employer will not dismiss employees in an extremely unfair and exemplary manner recognized in this case."
He said, "It's embarrassing and extremely unfair."

The annual repurchase of listed companies is over 10 billion yuan in the history of the new high - New China Network
In order to stabilize the company's stock price, maintain the company's image, listed companies in the past two years began to buy shares frequently, through targeted repurchases, collective bargaining and other ways, hoping to the company's value to be underestimated to the market, so as to stabilize the stock price, enhance investor confidence.
Oriental wealth Choice data show that in 2017, the funds used by listed companies to buy back shares were $7.9 billion, in 2018, to a surge of 510 billion, since 2019, the total amount of repurchase of listed companies has exceeded 10 billion yuan, the creation of a new high in A-shares history to buy back funds, and far more than the previous year.
From the point of view of the purpose of repurchase, the company's repurchase shares and large shareholders appear to be the same, but there is a big difference in the implementation of the subject, the source of funds, the purpose of repurchase, the rights and interests of the stock itself.
In an interview with the reporter of the Securities Daily in Shanghai, Xu Yang, the chairman of Shanghai Meikon Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said that in November 2018, the "point of view on supporting the repurchase of shares of listed companies", on the existing system such as the narrow scope of share repurchase, decision-making process is complex, inventory system is not sound, etc., was repaired, because the policy has begun to encourage the repurchase of shares of listed companies, so the phenomenon of repurchase of shares of the year has increased significantly.
In January, SSE and SZSE officially issued the "Regulations on the Implementation of Listed Companies Repurchase Shares". These policies have been introduced to broaden the source of funds for listed companies to repurchase, simplify the implementation process, guide and improve governance arrangements, and encourage all kinds of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee shareholding plans.
After the suggestion, listed companies to carry out the operation of the stock repurchase, with more applicable conditions, the repurchase process is simpler, the stock repurchase is also more active.
Repurchase shares in a relatively low position, but also conducive to raising the efficiency of the use of funds by listed companies, thereby increasing the profitability of each share, improving net asset yield, and reducing the pressure of the company's profitability index.
Compared with the increase in shareholders, listed companies buy back shares have a greater significance, but also shows that the listed company's active market value management wishes and cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the stock price is underestimated as the main factor in the repurchase of listed companies, the company's stock price can no longer reflect the future development prospects of the company, so these companies are worth the attention of investors, but can not blindly invest, need to pay attention to the financial statements of such listed companies and specific business situations.
There are large-scale repurchases of listed companies, at least showing the company's development confidence and financial strength.
A-share listed companies' repurchase enthusiasm is gradually rising, but also makes the repurchase behavior normalization, data show that there are nearly a thousand listed companies to implement the share repurchase this year, and the industry's dragon companies have become the main focus of the repurchase market.
Ping An of China recently disclosed the progress of the purchase, the company through the centralized competitive transaction mode has accumulated a cumulative repurchase of A shares of 5759 million shares, accounting for 0.315 % of the company's total share capital, the total amount of paid funds total of 500 million yuan (excluding transaction fees), the repurchase shares will be used for all employee shareholding plans, including but not limited to the long-term service plans approved by the general meeting of the company.
Ely shares have paid $5792 million for share repurchase, and in the recent use of repurchase shares for adjustment, by the original plan "repurchase shares will be used all as the stock source for future implementation of equity incentives" changed to "accumulative repurchase of 1.83 million shares, of which 1.52 million shares are used for the implementation of equity incentive stock sources, the remaining 3049 million shares will be used to cancel to reduce registered capital."
Ely shares said that the part of the purchased shares were canceled, which would be conducive to further upgrading the earnings per share level, and effectively improving the return on the investment of the company's shareholders.
On September 25th, the TCL Group issued an announcement of the progress of the repurchase, indicating that TCL Group has accumulated a total repurchase of 3.59% of the shares of the company, a total expenditure of $16.5 million.
The Office of the Board of Directors of TCL Group said that the repurchase shares will be used for the employee shareholding plan, equity incentives, or corporate bonds that can be converted into shares issued by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, and continuously improves its competitiveness and continues to develop healthily.
Based on the confidence of the company's future development and the maintenance of the interests of investors, combined with the performance of the company's shares in the past year's secondary market, and take into account the company's operating situation and financial situation and other factors, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing funds and other financing methods to buy back the company's shares.
Qianhai Open Source Fund chief economist Jan Delong said that listed companies can reduce the number of shares in circulation on the one hand, increase the company's earnings per share, for the secondary market is an important advantage; in addition, the listed companies are willing to take the initiative to buy real gold and silver from the stock market to pay off the stock market, which greatly boosts market confidence.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially good shares, through the share repurchase to boost investor confidence is a very good way, but also worthy of affirmation and encouragement.
Hunan Provincial Committee of the Standing Committee, the Changsha Municipal Committee Secretary Hu Henghua and Engineering Machinery Manufacturing Xiangjun four palms - jin shuangxin, Liang Henggen, He Qinghua, Liu Feixiang, around the "changsha from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing" set a "small target" - three years later to build the world's leading engineering machinery industry cluster.
In Changsha to build the world's leading engineering machinery industry cluster, in terms of modern style, is to build "the most powerful surface".
As an inland capital city, Changsha shouts out this magnificent word, where is the bottom line?
It is due to the strength of the hegemony.
The four engineering mechanical companies who participated in the dialogue, one hand, covering the whole field of heaven, earth, sea, land: Shanhe intelligent light aircraft, China Union heavy industry concrete transport pump, three heavy ground crane, railway construction of the tunnel shielding mechanism, its "hard power" can be called a single step, proud crowd.
China has basically no language in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
In time, Chinese enterprises "incoming" "going out" double-wheel drive, take the "one-way" initiative of the east wind, acquisition, merger, plant and so on, and become the global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, the construction machinery leading enterprises such as Sinolink, iron and steel reconstruction, Shanhe intelligent and other engineering machinery, its output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators, has been substantially leading the same enterprises.
It's based on the timing of the camera.
Changsha Engineering Machinery Industry Cluster is a leading enterprise in the global engineering machinery industry.
In the global industry of the Yangtze River, who lives and lives well, is a hard place to talk.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry encountered a cold winter, many international well-known engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen, but Changsha engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to "cat winter" as "winter swim", self-pressure, self-break through the industrial structure transformation, from manufacturing to intelligent transformation, not only the past, but also the body bone stronger.
It's a month-to-month co-operation.
The development of a competitive advantage industry requires both positive business and positive government action.
Changsha has the reputation of "the capital of engineering machinery", is in the aggregate from the upstream to the downstream of the whole industry chain, to build a multi-related industry cluster, and through optimizing the business environment, perfect supporting services, simplified approval process and other management and uniform measures, the development, manufacturing, sales cost of enterprises is greatly reduced.
Good business environment, let the engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to come.
History has pushed Changsha to the front desk to build a global engineering machinery leading level, I can't wait.
Whether it is the government, or the enterprise, or even related product researchers, should seize opportunities, as a matter of fact, bite the target, and continue to develop, in order to build and manufacture a strong country to contribute to the power of Hunan.

The 58-year-old villager, Shavili, gave the goat in the goat circle to fill the last salmon grass, keep on the side of the slot, look at the white lake sheep a bite of chewing.
"Eat well, wait for autumn and winter to be full, out of the fence to sell a good price."
He feeds sheep "special nutritious meals" every day, regularly cleanses and sanitizes, and carefully treats don't dare to slow down.
Hawai'i has been feeding sheep for more than 20 years, until he came to work in cooperatives to know how thick the sheep were in the past.
Hawai'i is a villager in Hawai'i, Qingcheng District, Qingyang City, Jinan Province.
His left and right wards are all sheep shelters, but the traditional way of scavenging, poor quality of sheep, and a small number of fences.
This June, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Shavili spent the whole day studying farming, because he always had a crush on his heart.
The people who joined the stock clear color is poverty-stricken, they are all hosted by the sheep to the cooperative, can not be divided and sold at the end of the year, can count on him.
Good for the guidance of technical personnel, he slowly learns to fight the epidemic, masters the science of feeding, has become a village of few breeding "good way".
The Professional Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with a total of 16 sheep sheds and about 1400 lakes.
The co-operative head of the cooperative, Han, said that there is a door outside the standardized sheep's shed.
"The wool is thick, easy to breed bacteria, the lake sheep must not stay in a wet and humid place, the sheep's shed must be built in a three-way loop, but also must be fitted with a replacement fan to cool through the wind."
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, it is also necessary to regularly disinfect the sheep's sheds and put three to four anti-epidemic measures on the sheep in the first quarter.
In addition to living well, "little sheep" can also eat grass mixed with green corn, wheatgrass, dragonfly, and other herbs, and have a large enough "playground" to stretch the bones.
The cooperative adopts a method of co-ordination and parenting, and guides local farmers to put good lake goats here, unifying the cultivation, management, sales, and achieving the cultivation, scientificization, standardization, and aggregation of farming.
Today, 140 households with sheep into the stock, each household has more than $6000 a year, and four of them have built a card to support poverty alleviation targets working in cooperatives.

France's lender says it will cut tax by more than €1 billion next year and urge Germany to follow up on it.
Reuters Paris, Sept. 26 - French Treasury Secretary Bruno Le Maire said France will cut its tax rate by more than 10 billion euros (US$109 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France's financial stimulus to reinvigorate the economy.
Lemer said in an introduction to France's 2020 budget, the ECB's latest monetary easing initiative has created an opportunity to increase investment for those who have the capacity to take part in it.
The European Central Bank (ECB) cut its interest rate to a record new low on September 12, and plans to re-purchase its debt to reduce borrowing costs, hoping to incentivize economic recovery and promote inflation.
"Low interest rates will not allow Europe to thrive, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough," Lemer said to reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, now needs, the sooner the better. Don't wait until the situation gets worse and more action," he added.
He has repeatedly appealed to Germany.
France has already implemented a tax cut of more than €1 billion this year, which has greatly boosted France's economic growth.
The global economy is losing momentum and relies on the export of Germany's economy.
France's household tax burden will be reduced by €93 billion next year, including €5 billion in income tax relief, Lemer said.
In addition, with the company's tax rate going to drop from 33.3% to 25% over the five-year period, the company's tax burden will be reduced by nearly €1 billion.

Study: U.S. National Healthy Diet Index Has Slightly Increased, But Still Challenging
On September 27, according to the U.S. Daily News, a recent study in the U.S. showed that in 16 years, the U.S. government's health diet index had moderate growth, from 56 to 58.
However, in the case of 100 percent, it is not worth celebrating.
U.S. nationals are still facing "significant challenges" in their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Fang-fang Zhang, a nutritionist at Tufts University of Massachusetts, said that Americans still have too much food that can cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, which are the most common diseases for American nationals.
The study was published in the American Medical Journal on 24.
The study was based on a health study conducted by the U.S. government between 1999 and 2016 on 44,000 adults.
The authors wrote, "Although there are significant improvements, significant dietary challenges still exist."
These challenges have been reported to have allowed the U.S. nationals to reduce the intake of food that contains qi and fat, such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cattle, and butter.
Studies have found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people's daily diets increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% intake cap.
The biggest improvement in the American national diet was the amount of sugar consumed reduced from 16% to about 14%, but still too high.
It is believed that the intake of sugar added should be less than 10 percent.
For the reasons of sugar intake reduction, researchers believe that the reduction of people's consumption of sweet soda, but Zhang Fang stressed that sugar is often added to foods that are not even sweet, such as yogurt and tomatoes.
Adults in the United States have a small increase in intake of fruits, nuts, oatmeal and other whole grain foods.
However, in 2016, data showed that the proportion of these foods remained less than 5% in their daily diet.
Although people's intake of salt is slightly reduced, the reduction of drinking juice leads to low-quality carbohydrate intake, Zhang Fang said they still account for up to 42% of their daily calories, many of which come from refined white breads and other refined grains.
The study is based on a personal health survey conducted every two years, which allows adults to recall what they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health checks have been asked twice a day since 2003.
The U.S. resident diet guide issued by the government recommends that people adopt a "healthy diet mode" to reduce the likelihood of chronic disease.
The guide points out that people should consume more nutritious foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood that can provide proteins, lean meat, poultry meat, eggs, seed foods.
During the study, the number of people living with diabetes in the United States nearly doubled, more than 7%, and the obesity rate also increased in many years during the study - today, about 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese.
Heart disease remains the leading cause of death for American nationals.

The deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnel tunnel is refreshed
After more than 1200 days of overnight construction, Chengda (Li) Rui (Li) Railway Gao Lijiashan Tunnel No. 1 Hujing completed the excavation on 27 days, the well depth reached below the ground below 762.59 meters, broke the deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnel Hujing, and this record was created in a large flooding situation.
Darui Railway Gaolishan Tunnel is located in Yunnan, the longest tunnel in Asia with double-lane single-hole.
The tunnel crosses 19 cracks with a maximum depth of 1155 meters, as it almost covers all the undesirable geological and significant risks that the tunnel may encounter, called the "geo-museum" built by the tunnel.

1 The well successfully excavated to the bottom, marking the Gao Lishan tunnel officially entered the horizontal tunnel construction, waiting for the bottom of the car to excavate and replace the equipment, the bottom of the well can increase the four surfaces, accelerate the tunnel hole excavation speed.
"The well is all over the granite floor, because the granite floor cracks are more, can't stop the water, from the top to the bottom of a continuous flow, basically how deep the water pressure will be."
The general engineer of the railway project department of China Railway Tunnel Bureau told reporters that during the construction of the pit, several times sludge water, collapse and other risks, construction party invited experts on site to the pulse, more than 20 studies and treatment programs.
"When the maximum splashing water in the hole, it reaches more than 300 cubic meters per hour, and the depth of more than 700 meters, the water pressure is equivalent to the depth of 700 meters. "
"If there is no timely drainage, it will drown 10 meters in an hour, we are almost 85% of the time to cure the water, and 15% of the time to dig in."
In order to overcome the quality problems such as the development of sewerage around the rock, squeezing water and granite, tunnel construction uses a combination of "exploration, injection, excavation" water treatment measures to reduce the risk of construction.
After several improvements, the construction of the hole construction formed a excavation system, outcast system, suspension system, pallet truck lifting system and other mechanical pipelines, to achieve eye-catching, explosion, outcast, template installation, concrete construction and other full-process mechanical operations, speed up the construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1200 days of night construction, the well successfully completed 762.59 meters of deep excavation.

The holiday season is approaching, and people's vacation plans are gradually coming to an end.
"Securities Daily" reporters recently launched a small survey on the "Eleven" holiday arrangements in their circle of friends, and the nearly 20 feedback received showed that everyone's plans are different, but "travel + consumption" has become the key word of the "Eleven" holiday.
In a report published by the Securities Daily reporter, more than half of the respondents opted for travel.

There are several things to be done in detail, and the character characteristics of type A blood are becoming more and more strong, and they all feel very different.
Take the suit, buy nutritional granules, pay, buy fish chips, Nana snacks.
This is the reason for the departure.

In the middle of the night, my friend was in the middle of the night.
Washed a bunch of grapes sent by a friend, left half to Boao, left the rest in the favorite small bowl, and went out to see the moon.
And I sat upon the earth, and I ate the grapes and ate the skin of her; and I pour out the seed of her grapes vigorously.
The moon is hidden in the clouds, good in the clouds, the moon is ignored, and a dark fall is a bit thorny.
The brain bursts with poems about the month of the month, but it is only clear that it prefers the phrase: every time three or five rounds of clear protection jade fence / day to praise / thousands of people looking up.
Maybe we gave too much emotion to the moon, for now for me, in fact, the word of God to God, Caesar is the best.
The moon is the moon, and the moon is the moon.
And it came to pass, [that] the month of Ramadhan was at an end.
Naruto had a slight snoring at his feet, standing up, laying the small blanket of Naruto on her small house, Naruto lay on it cheerfully.

In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. economy 'results' showed that by private sector investments and exports significantly decreased, the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth significantly slower than the previous quarter.
Analysts pointed out that the trade friction and the uncertainty it brings is the main reason for the decline in private sector investment and export in the second quarter.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce's final revised data released on 26th, U.S. GDP increased by 2% year-on-year in the second quarter, compared with the previously published revised data, but significantly lower than 3.1 percent in the first quarter.

But experts have also said that if the trade friction is mitigated, the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets will be improved.
The U.S. economy is expected to continue this year's gradual downward trend, with growth to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Moody's analysis company's chief economist Mark Shandi predicted that this year's U.S. economic growth will be 2.3 percent and will be further reduced to 1.6 percent in the future, assuming that the trade friction will no longer continue to rise.
Elen Harzen, investment manager of Pattnam investment company, pointed out that the biggest concern of the current enterprise is the trade dispute and its uncertainty, if the trade dispute can be resolved, uncertainty will be greatly reduced, the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than now.
Miller-Tabker Asset Management's equity strategist Matt Murray said that trade friction is still the "first issue", but also the main reason for this year's large fluctuation in the U.S. capital market, trade friction can be properly solved, will affect the rest of this year's U.S. capital market is the key.

Liu Kun, Minister of Finance: 67 central banks and financial institutions have invested $8601 million to enrich the social security fund.
The Minister of Finance, Liu Kun, said that to date, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital enrichment social security fund, with a total of about 8601 million yuan.
Liu Kun said that at the national subdivision of some state-owned capital enrichment social security fund task meeting jointly held by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the National Finance Committee on that day.
"Planning part of the state-owned capital to enrich social security fund, is an important measure for reform and improve the basic pension insurance system, is the achievements of state-owned enterprises shared and the full manifestation of the basic pension insurance system, is based on the current and long-term management of policy measures."
In 2017, the State Council issued the "partial state-owned capital enrichment social security fund implementation program", requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilots.
According to Liu Kun, the pre-workout has been effective.
At the central level, a total of three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred, and the total amount of state-owned capital is about 8601 million yuan.
The central financial institution that the Ministry of Finance has performed the responsibilities of the funder has been basically completed.
There is a certain size of the central business.
At the local level, the company has been relocated to the previous stage.
As of the end of 2018, Zhejiang and Yunnan pilot work was basically completed, and the capital was $158 million and $185 million, respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out preparatory work to lay the foundation for the next rollout.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State Administration of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the State-owned Capital Enrichment Social Security Fund was fully launched in 2019, and was basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting was held on the same day, with a specific deployment of the full-scale rollout.
The meeting emphasized the need for effective and effective completion of the work.
"According to the progress arrangement, the dumping work will be basically completed by the end of 2020.
Work hard, work hard. '
Liu Kun said that all regions and departments should be carefully organized and carefully arranged to ensure that the work is completed in accordance with the requirements; to implement the work, to accurately grasp the contents of the policy; to strengthen communication coordination, and to solve problems in a timely manner.
The goal of the national fund is to provide strong support for pension protection, starting from the beginning of the "reinforcement of social security fund money bags".
However, the author believes that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement", but a "mathematic addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources, the State Administration of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the "Notice of the Work of the State-owned Capital Enrichment Social Security Fund" to clarify the time table of the State-owned Capital Enrichment Social Security Fund, that is, the central and local branches of the State-owned Capital Enrichment Social Security Fund was fully launched in 2019.
After the publication of the documents, the Ministry of Finance and other departments were implemented quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10% of the ownership of industrial and commercial banks and agricultural banks to the Social Security Fund, and the total value of the two shares to more than $11.5 billion.
In accordance with the provisions, the Social Security Foundation and other undertakings as a financial investor, enjoy the right to income, disposal and right to know the state-owned equity.
According to the announcement, this change of interest will not lead to changes in the shareholders of the Bank and the actual controller.
In this regard, the author believes that a similar state-owned enterprise stock transfer is not a simple change in equity attribution, but a series of effects can be triggered "the addition of the operation."
The first step of some national capital transfer social security "Additional results", of course, can be reflected in the state-owned enterprises of all the people, development results shared by all.
After years of reform and development, state enterprises, especially central enterprises in China's economy is mostly in important industries and fields, the overall profitability is more strong and more stable.
As a result, the company continues to do a lot of good.
On July 10, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided that this year to fully promote the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich social security fund work.
The Ministry of Finance, along with the relevant departments, will, according to the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, fully promote the work of some state-owned capital enrichment social security fund, fully reflect the basic pension insurance system intergenerational fairness and state-owned enterprise development results shared by all.
The second step of the transformation of "additional results" is to enhance the sustainability of China's social security fund, and further strengthen the foundation of the pension social security system.
With ageing population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and this time, as a sub-heading of the national capital, most of them have continuous profit and dividend ability, not only can effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide a source of living water for the social security fund.
It has been calculated that every 3.8 points of state-owned capital, can support the company's basic pension insurance deposit ratio decreased by 1 percent.
The third step of the spin-off "Additional Results" is to increase the stabilization of the capital market.
The method of transferring the proceeds of the acquisition of the subject is "distributed by red, operating as a complement."
As a state-owned financial investor, the Social Security Fund is essentially a dividend yield.
However, social security funds, as a value investor in the capital market, have a stronger capital operation capacity.
For listed assets in the state-owned capital, the Social Security Fund will participate in holdings, will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies, which is conducive to improving the level of business operations, and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.

Protests against Egypt's mountain rains indicate a strong repression
Twitter hashtags and social media are urging the Egyptians to take the streets today to peacefully appeal President Ceysey to leave.
However, the authorities have stated that they are planning to use force to repress.
Since the beginning of the military coup in 2013, Sissy, the then-chief of the army, has expressed his objections to the fact that it is almost silent in Egypt, and that any form of protest activities are even more at extreme risk.
The United Kingdom's Guardian reported that the Centre for Economic and Social Rights in Egypt, a non-governmental organization in Cairo, pointed out that more than 1900 people have been arrested since the rare outbreak of the last weekend's demand for Cessation.
Thousands of people have marched into the streets since the 20th anniversary of the allegation of corruption by Sissi and his family.
The Egyptian Ministry of Interior held a strong stance yesterday, saying that any attempt to undermine the stability of the country will be decisively confronted and will not be soft.
The city centre of Cairo has long been vindicated, and the streets around the Tahrir Square in the Egyptian revolution detonated in 2011 can be seen riot police, safety agencies vehicles, and casualty police.
The media reported that security forces detained a number of important scholars and social leaders for 25 days, including Professor of Political Science of the University of Cairo and renowned columnist Nafa.
He tweeted on the 24th that "I have no doubt that continuing the absolute rule of Messi will cause a catastrophe."
"He immediately left his office in the interests of Egypt."
Hosni, a former Egyptian military commander-in-chief, was detained before Nafa was arrested.
Annan was arrested after attempting to compete with the President of Sicily last year.
The Constitutional Party chairman Dawud was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that in this time of economic crisis between the poor and the middle class, twilight dissenters practice reflects the government's instability and vulnerability.
The opposition leader, Ayman Nour, who once led the president, said, "The arrests have highlighted how much fear this regime has left the people of Egypt and its own people."
"Because the economy has been smashed by him, coupled with widespread political oppression, Cessie tries to convey clear messages to important leaders and politicians who may be replaced."

"One hand has been" two special high-pressure projects to be carried out
On 26th, Zhudong East to Henan ±1100 kilowatt high-voltage DC transmission project, Sutong 1000 kilowatt AC high-voltage GIL integrated pipe corridor project was put into operation.
These two projects occupy the respective high points of the world's transmission technology, and will greatly improve the allocation of China's energy-wide optimization.
Guo Zhi, the general economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the quintessential east-south project is the world's largest transmission capacity and the shortest transmission distance from the power supply project.
Its shipment is important for promoting the development of energy bases in Xinjiang and ensuring power supply in the East China region.
GIL, that is, the gas insulating metal closes the transmission line.
Sutong Gallery project, created the world's highest voltage level of GIL project and the most powerful transmission capacity record, to achieve the 'AC bicycling network' operation of the highest voltage level of China's backbone power network.
According to the State Grid Company, the transmission distance of the guandong to jiangnan project is 3324 kilometers.
If the use of conventional technology, more than 15% of the electricity will be used in the road, and the project has been researched and developed, so that the economic transmission distance significantly increased to more than 3000 km.
After the project is put into operation, every 8 hours and 20 minutes can deliver 100 million kWh of electricity, which can help to break down the existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, the single line annual power supply will reach 600 to 850 kWh, can meet more than half of Shanghai's electricity consumption throughout the year.
Sutong GIL integrated pipeline project is a control project of the ultra-high pressure AC ring network across the Yangtze River.
If a conventional overhead line crosses the river, it is necessary to establish two giant towers over 450 meters above the surface of Yangtze River, and to build an artificial island over four football fields of size for each tower.
In this regard, the state grid brave innovation, developed a compact special high-pressure AC GIL transmission technology, through the tunnel from the underwater river, to avoid the impact on the gold channel.
Two projects have driven the manufacturing capacity of electrical equipment in China to achieve a new wave.
At present, the national grid has accumulated to build "10 intersections 11 straight" special high-pressure projects, and "4 intersections 3 straight" in the construction.

The transfer or exchange of land contracting business rights will be subject to separate management methods.
'Consider' pointed out that in the context of 'three rights division', farmers' shareholding is only a certain period of land management rights.
In theory, even if a bankruptcy liquidation occurs, farmers only exist to lose a certain period of risk of operating rights, so the provisions of the contract to return the original contractor in the law is no longer necessary, and there is a conflict with the 'Insolvency Law'.
In order to prevent the risk of land loss, priority shares, first-come-first-served shares, repurchases and other methods have been developed in practice.
Considering that priority stocks in the company law has a more mature theoretical discussion, it is recommended to use it as an initiative to prevent the risk of loss of shares.
