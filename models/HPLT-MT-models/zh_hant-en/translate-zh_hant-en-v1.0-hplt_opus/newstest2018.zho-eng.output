U.S. Civil rights groups warn of travel to the state of Missouri
Due to the disparity policies and racism attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Promotion of People of Color (NAACP) issued travel warnings to those preparing to travel to Missouri.
“NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which came into effect on August 28, 2017, has recently issued a series of suspicious racist incidents in Missouri, and all African American travelers, tourists, and Missourians should pay special attention and take extreme caution when traveling in Missouri,” said the group’s statement.
NAACP points out that a recent Missouri law has made it harder for people to win discriminatory lawsuits, which have also been enforced to a certain extent against a small number of groups, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
The act of violating the rights of citizens is taking place in the hands of the people.
They were asked about being beaten or killed because of the color of the parking lot," Rod Chapel, president of NACAP, Missouri, told The Kansas City Star.
"We received a lot of complaints, a lot more than ever."
This is the first type of warning issued by the organization in the United States against certain states.
The organization cites the racism of the University of Missouri against black students and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Sanders died in suspicious situations. He was depleted with fuel when traveling in Missouri and was detained by the Missouri police without charges of crime.
A recent report from the Attorney General's Office of the Missouri State Attorney General revealed that "the state's black driver is 75% more likely to be parked than whites."
“The advice is to raise awareness and warn their family, friends and colleagues of what may happen in Missouri,” said Chapel.
"People need to be prepared, whether they take the bail to the state of Missouri, or let their relatives know they're traveling in the state."
According to the latest data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, and the state ranked 16th in the country based on the crime.
Travel warnings are also responding to new laws in Missouri, which will make it harder for companies to prosecute housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration law law requiring local law enforcement agencies to detain migrant offenders, the U.S. Citizens Freedom League (ACLU) said it would increase the number of racial cases and issued travel advisory on Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government for other countries, but recently, consulting groups have taken this approach to address certain laws and trends in the U.S.

BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city: let the old and new feel "live in a new era"
On January 18th, the British media reported that Beijing may have a history of 3,000 years, but it is quickly becoming a modern charming city today.
The capital of China has a fast and amazing internet, some face recognition software and other cutting-edge technology, invested in artificial intelligence and has an unrivalled international energy, it is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are rich in the spirit of exploration.
According to the BBC's website on January 16, "If I can succeed there, I will succeed anywhere in the future," said Clemens Sesch, a German journalist. He quoted the song by the singer Frank Sinatra Gonzalez in New York City.
"If Sinatra live today, he will probably sing a city like Beijing," he said, "living in this city will make you feel "living in a new era" and will always be able to keep up with the trend."
The old home, located in England, but recently lived in Beijing, wrote an article on the personal blog site 4Corners7Seas, saying: "People generally have a feeling in some kind of large things center, this feeling is difficult to say clearly, but it leaves many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and want to see a witness."
The city's high-quality, high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever, the report said.
"Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, the Internet integrates the functionality of traditional wallets into a smartphone, making it easier for everyone to make a lot of transactions," said Andi Penia Fuerte, who is currently the vice president of the "Beijing Children" website.
The report said, but the smartphone is just the beginning of Beijing's technology ambition, facial recognition software has been widely used, many mobile applications use this technology to bank transfers and payments, let people enter the apartment and office, and even use it to verify the identity of the driver.
Beijing recently announced plans to build an artificial intelligence technology park with more than 400 enterprises after completion, they will focus on the development of a variety of artificial intelligence technologies from biological detection to autonomous driving.
Food is also the core of China's history many major festivals, participating in these celebrations are highly praised by foreigners, Spring Festival is the most important social and economic holiday, and is one of the most important festivals for foreigners to participate in.
Séch said: "I recommend helping Chinese friends prepare for the year, cleaning the apartments and home page with a new year's greetings red spring league is just as important, on the New Year's Eve, all family members must come together to eat a full meal, and then keep the age to midnight, with a bright flame to welcome the new year. For foreigners, the night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to integrate."
The report said that the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but the language barrier between China and the convenience of communication between the migrants is easy to become an excuse for them not to fully integrate into the local culture.
"Some foreigners have lived in China for years, but they have little experience with their host country. If the initial attempts to contact Chinese people are not successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.
'In these so-called "old foreign bubbles" ('old foreign bubbles') refers to foreigners only mix with foreigners, without contact with the local and local culture - translators note), foreigners in their own communities, in their own restaurants, eat in western restaurants, and only friends with foreigners.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin - which is easier than one might imagine.
"The first two or three hours of private Chinese lessons a week or the radio dramas at the entry level should be suitable for everyone's busy schedule," Sesch said.
Even a few classic phrases can help with shopping, dining at a restaurant, or chatting on a taxi.
The report said that solid air pollution is also a fact in daily life, but in recent years the government has tried to curb some of the problems.
The residents stress that it is important to visit outdoor activities during the warmer months of the year when pollution is often milder, to use these blue days as an opportunity in the historic Hutongli Township or to explore the popular park.
“Beijing is the city where you can find the most things below the surface, and you can find the right art and music activities, romantic nightlife, historical wonders, super modern business districts, and ancient Hutong districts,” said Norton.
According to the report, aging has become increasingly apparent in the role of human capital growth, especially in the Northeast, the annual contribution rate for the growth of human capital is -1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng pointed out that the current cross-border capital flow risk is controllable, and the fundamental factor supporting the balance of payments still exists for a long time.
On December 17, 2016, China's Ancient Paintings and Restoration and Protection International Summit was held at Renmin University of China.
In April of this year, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile manufacturers to pre-installed Google Search and Chrome browsers and other software, otherwise it would not allow other Google apps.
The European Commission considers this to be harmful to consumers and hinders competition.
The EU regulator initially asked Google to respond before July 27.
If anti-monopoly is convicted, Google faces up to 10% of its global revenue, about $7.4 billion.
Google hasn't commented on this right away.
Google is also facing a European Union investigation in the search results for its own shopping service.

A View from the Other Side: The Legal Status of Coins Around the World
Abstract: In addition to speculative properties naturally triggered price callbacks, this round of digital currency has been smashed with the "stay enemy" - there is no correlation to the risk of supervision.
View from a visual map, the eastern state of Bitcoin is more conservative than the West, accounting for the global body of countries are still looking at the legitimacy of digital currency, which means that the "black hail risk" is still very large.
*This article comes from Wall Street (WeChat ID: wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more information, please visit wallstreetcn.com or download the Wall Street app. *
With China, South Korea and the European Union and other major markets such as Bitcoin, the global digital currency that dominated Bitcoin has been bloodshed since this week, the Bitcoin price fell below $10,000 in total mental numbers on Tuesday, and the largest single-day drop since three years ago.
In addition to speculative properties naturally triggered price callbacks, this round of digital currency falls also has been associated with the ever-increasing "coupling enemy" - the risk of supervision is irrelevant.
In this important threshold, the visualized big data website HowMuch.net produced a graph that shows the legal status and degree of supervision of Bitcoin in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market of Bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, although it has not yet been publicly legalized, but there are no major restrictions on the use of Bitcoin; light pink represents the restricted market, that is, the use of digital currencies by local governments trying to use red-line policies or regulatory methods; dark pink means that Bitcoin is defined as an illegal country; gray is the country that has not been evaluated.

According to the article, the distribution of color blocks from non-green in the picture can be seen that the traditional sense of the Eastern state's attitude to bitcoin is more conservative than the West.
Russia is the largest country currently defined as Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets in Bitcoin, India is one of the largest countries that has not yet been rated on Bitcoin and has not yet issued relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the areas with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, that is, the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views expressed by countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin have been significantly different, and the distribution of color blocks in the above regions is more complex.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are legal bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and other countries have certain restrictions on its trading and use, and more Latin American countries still have no voice over bitcoin.
It is well known that among the 246 countries in the world, 99 countries (or 40%) do not impose restrictions on Bitcoin's trading and use, i.e. green and orange areas.
There are 7 countries (or 3%) that are restricted markets (dark pink), 10 countries (or 4%) that define Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), 130 countries (or 53%) yet have not received more digital currency information (grey).
This indicates that countries (53%, more than half) of the world's subjects are still looking forward to the legitimacy of Bitcoin-based digital currencies in the territory, which also represents Bitcoin's "black halogen risk" remains large, as some of them may eventually make a legislative decision to restrict the digital currency.
The article argues that the global regulatory body has not fully understood this emerging category of digital currencies, perhaps the main reason why most countries have not yet expressed their opinion.
Although Bitcoin's "popular" has grown numerically since last year, it does not mean that all countries are interested, some countries may be worried that local fiat currencies are threatened as a result, or that digital currencies are being exploited by criminal organizations.
Wall Street Journal wrote a detailed summary of Bitcoin's international regulatory news over the past week, including China's start to fight foreign exchange centralized services online platform and mobile app, South Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchange, the European Union believes that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warned investors of the risk of "claim to blood inexhaustible".
Wall Street observator selected "Readings | 2018: The Year of the Global Central Bank" has mentioned that from any point of view of regulation, acceptance / criticism, adoption, 2018 will be the year of the global central bank's digital currency.
Russia and other countries criticise the legitimacy of Bitcoin, in fact, is also the way to officially issue digital currency.
On January 8, NWS Madrid (reporter Shay Yuzhi) Barcelona's new rescue, Cutinio 8, debuted in No Camp.
On the morning of the same day, Coutinho passed a medical examination at Basa and signed a contract with Basa President Bartomeu to expire in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Bass player in front of nearly 7000 fans in Nocamp.
According to the Spanish media, the total transfer fee of Coutinho reached €1.6 billion (1 euro contract $7.77 RMB), which is the first living value of the Barca Club and the Spanish history.
Due to the damage under his eyes, he still needs to rest for nearly 20 days before he can meet his jersey.

Trump's White House is Aiming for Statue of Liberty
The most defining sign of a change of power is when they begin to attack statues.
So in 2003, Saddam Hussein, who was well-planned to overthrow in Baghdad's Paradise Square.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Trump administration, was in a heated debate with Jim Acosta of the American Wired TV News Network (CNN) on the proposal to restrict legal immigrants with strict restrictions, and he was certain to know what would happen to a slashing of the Statue of Liberty.
Fairly speaking, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he does so, then a group of ship owners and liberal followers will surely swallow him alive.
But he actually attacked the significance of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus' famous poem was engraved on the dock (a monument built 17 years later).
"I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to illuminate the world.
The poem that you refer to is later added, not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is right, but as he himself said, it's not about history.
This involves the modern echo of Lazarus' words, the only country that doesn't seem to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poverty, or the crowds of your sluts desire to breathe freely, and/or the suffering people reject the beaches that you crave."
There is no "difficult man refuses" in the moment that our screen becomes more eye-catching.
Miller was not involved in literary commentaries, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcomed in the United States in the Trump era.
This conflict about the significance of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends, who held an event that engraved her poems on the dock after her death, made it clear that the behavior they were involved in was highly political.
The purpose of this sculpture is to express the connection between France and American republicanism through a feminine incarnation of the Statue of Liberty, an old classic metaphor.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poetry, the image of a woman is no longer abstract, and she wants to be heard.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The combination of this poem and the painting is a successful feminist coup, and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, the right wingers have always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, is a temporary baptist of Trump. In 2010, he thought that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and now he is an early neoconservative who brings the wisdom of America to the world of fools: "The Goddess of Liberty is brave.
She intended to take free torch from the United States to other parts of the world.
The torch is not the way to light the United States."
It's not surprising that Linbo is actually motivated by something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely dependent on the perception.
Lazarus's imaginative approach is to be able to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people can see it on the deck after a long and often terrible journey.
On the surface, it relates to the point of view of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statues conveyed to them the hope and welcome that they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not the view that Mill and Trump have always wanted to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light up the way, but to light up their only source of strength.

2017 World Championship: Neil Black highly commended the Scottish team in the UK National Team
Eilidh Doyle recalls that at the time there were only two Scottish national teams.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the British Athletics Association, said that the 16 strong teams in the World Championship team will make a huge contribution to the "national team".
The number of Scottish athletes selected to participate in the opening of the 2017 London Athletics World Championship on Friday marked the best in history.
Black believes that "Scotland is making extraordinary progress," and British athletics have to learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will stick to it until we succeed," Black said.
"I'm looking for people from the Scottish Academy of Sport who think this is relevant to them.
The Scottish Athletics think that this is relevant to their behavior.
The British Association of Athletics considers this to be relevant to their actions.
The same goes for street residents.
In any case, it is extremely brilliant."
A number of Scottish athletics were medal-winning pro-leaders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who would be 5,000 meters taller than Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as the team captain.
"Alyde is a bit humble.
"It's hard to believe," said Blake.
"Many athletics, whether or not they are Scottish, or wherever they live or train, are proud of their way out of the hallway and boastfully out of the hallway.
Alyde's natural input of passion and true feelings is very good."
The Commonwealth Silver Medalist who will participate in his fifth World Championship in the 400-metre crosshairs, says 16 Scottishs in the UK National Team, which is "unbelievable."
Previously, the maximum number of athletes who participated in the World Championships was 7, which is the number of participants acquired in 1983 and 2015.
In the past year, she has created five British records and two European records.
She will participate in the 1500 and 5000-meter project competitions.
O'Hare is another Scottish athlete to watch, and before that, she had made great progress in the season, winning both pre-election and Olympic anniversary in the UK, respectively.
Doyle recalls her participation in the First World Championship, when the only other Scottish man in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was very proud that so many of her fellows not only joined the team, but in some cases also challenged them to enter the finals.
"It's a great honor to be the captain of the national team," she added. "It's a great honor to be the captain of the national team," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish troops.
This is just an indication of how far we have gone.
And they are all veteran athletics athletes here, who are about to enter the field for the purpose of honoring the podium.
What is the message of my leader?
Well, I think it's super cool.
I was just referring to the fact that in this case, we were very lucky because we held the World Championship in the main hall.
That's why it's really important that we take advantage of home-based support and that we get bigger as we return to the Olympic Stadium.
I'll get a second chance to play, and the atmosphere there will be incredible."
In 2016, the total number of employees in China was 180,000, and the cost of employees was as high as 12.18 billion, an increase of 21% year-on-year.
Blocking critics in the face: If you can't tolerate the responsibilities of voters, don't run for office
Our Father understands the way bad media behaves.
American people love Washington, but soon after, the major newspapers began to smote him vigorously, from the domestic policy to the political principles, one did not let go.
He was unsurprising about these criticisms.
However, he did not criticise the critics.
As Washington said in 1783, "Freedom of speech is taken away - and we will be killed in silence and stupidity like a lamb."
This reminds me of Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people's posts as they posted their own views on the official Facebook page.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff thought the case was very low, and the online report was full of their strong resistance: "Who cares?"
Many people say, "It's just a face."
However, it is important.
This is especially important because it is related to Hogwarts.
He was a Republican who served as a governor in a democratic majority of states, and he was also very welcome.
Among the 50 state governors in the country, he received a second rating.
Hogan is not a reactionary agitator.
He is in control of the state of Maryland and strictly abides by the rules.
He is also very good at connecting Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, and show off his post-treatment head for the first time on the homepage.
So blocked people who come to the governor's page comments absolutely do not need to, and in the end, it is very dangerous. This page is a public forum, the official management platform of the staff list for public tax support.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Shas, for the governor's defense of her behavior, said she thought that blocking their comments was just trying to keep them off the hook.
However, they are overly grassy to describe it as a flooding beast or an angry cynic.
The Washington Post had a face-to-face conversation with people who were blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people in the leadership dialogue with their own choice: their identity is a teacher, a small business owner and a pastor, not a flooded beast.
Their comments are deep, respectful, and non-judgmental.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Rachmi Salma Ramani, the great attorney at Boyy, Maryland, is not jealous, but she asks questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post news story review section, "I am kind to comment that he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don't like one person to comment on the same topic, because these people are directly ignored by some people and think they are so-called people-oriented, rather than making them a group of citizens who are concerned about their country."
The term "dense junk information bombing" used by the governor's staff may appear to be "persistent" in other people's opinion.
The age of Facebook makes it easy to modify a message, just to block a critic or remove a negative comment.
It also clears away much more than in the past. In the past, to do the same effect, staff need to be sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critic remarks or to arrest protestors or to speak out.
This is exactly what is happening at the moment, but at the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of snoring on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being prosecuted by Twitter users because he has blocked them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling last week in Virginia that was about this type of issue.
According to the District Judge James C. Kachalis of the United States of America, the Chairman of the Ruden County Supervisory Commission blocked voter behavior from her Facebook page in violation of the First Amendment.
Governor Matt Beven (R) of Kentucky is also taken into consideration by the United States Citizens' Freedom Coalition for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had a similar effect.
The number of newspapers was four times between 1776 and 1800, and some wrote anonymous letters criticizing his leadership.
Even at that time, Washington had anonymity against him.
We use pseudonyms such as Eureka, Vallerius, Belize, and Bojus to write a letter to the newspaper to critically criticise Washington's decision.
According to the historic archives collected by the George Washington Press online project, his office was overwhelmed by the petitions he had signed with the United Kingdom, and criticized his approach to the United Kingdom's United Kingdom's friendly, commercial and maritime treaties with the United States.
However, he did not hear them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of speech and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
A true leader needs to accept this.
The wind blows of the city are driving people's sensitive nerves.
Limited purchase is a hard leverage of the real estate policy of many cities.
In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations, students can enjoy the same housing policy for the local resident residents for half a year.
In June, Wuhan University issued a policy that requires college students to leave their home within three years of graduation certificate and employment certificate.
After the policy added, the official said that "university students can buy less than 20% of the market price";
In July, Chengdu issued regulations that young talents with bachelor's degree or above from foreign universities can apply for residence in Chengdu with a graduation certificate.
In addition, there are Kunshan, Shanghai port and other cities or regions have also set up the "talent introduction" related policies, reducing the door to the purchase of talent.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually the major cities for the population, especially the talent, to retain the population, especially the talent, the city is competitive, which is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some people even think that this means that the time has come to cancel the building's "limited purchase".

Helensburgh O'Hare said: "Home-country games will have more meanings,
You want to do well; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, I've been playing golf.
I am very satisfied with the current situation."
The three-member team is the former Grandmasters, Ian Worcester, and the Standing Youth League champions, Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark Maynety.
There were six Scottish athletes in attendance, Sam Torons, Orr and former Leader of the Led Cup, and the other four were Andrew Odconn, Stephen Maclist, Bill Langbing, and Ross Drummond.

There is no paper for the next toilet that our visitors are going to enter, so this is what we are particularly focusing on in our new three-year plan.
To solve this imbalance.
Taking the toilet revolution to a deeper level is to think more about what people think.
Must have a third hygienic room to accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.
We've got our own bathroom, and we don't want to take it with us.

There has been a lot of success, and actively promoting the toilet revolution can not only help people away from the disease, but also lead to economic development to narrow the development gap.
The issue of the toilet is a motivator issue and a point of development of a social issue.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia
Bardtina Daiger doesn't need a stove when cooking.
She doesn't even use iron very often.
Her chalet is located in Analotali, the capital of Paniai County, Indonesia, where the housewife usually just put a sweet potato - the locals call it "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, the burnt sweet potato was picked up by a pair of unwashed hands, and the wolf swallowed the tiger and ate it.
Dai Jie was sitting on the mud floor - she had no furniture, and here she was doing daily household chores, such as washing clothes, washing clothes with very heavy water, all of them from nearby swamps.
There is a bucket in a room without a roof, which is an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she was not divided into fields to take care of her.
It is very common for a couple to see this phenomenon.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most men in the village are not working, and many are drunk like mud, plus there are a lot of soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk in the village after 5 p.m.," she said.
This is a rare glimpse of the daily life of the highlands of Papua, where it was once a Dutch colony, and joined Indonesia after the referendum in 1969, but the referendum was also controversial, when only 1026 officers were forced to vote by hand in front of the occupied army.
At present, the movement of independence and opposition to the rule of the Netherlands has quickly pointed spears to the government of Jakarta, because the government has put pressure on the region to rule, isolated foreign journalists and rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Anastro Tali is a far off location, a waste of smoke; to get there it takes 90 minutes by plane from the provincial capital Chayapra to Napier, and then rent a car for 5 hours, all the way through the gastronomy to the sea.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden cabbage is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the lush roofs of iron roofs are a variety of brown coverings made of iron.
There are very few Indonesians who come here, including journalists and almost no foreigner.
Before the advent of the Christian preachers, the Mee Pago Papuans believed in a God called Uga Tamee.
There are also other changes.
"We don't wear these clothes often," said DeJie. She refers to her brightly woven t-shirt, dark shirt, and a pretty dress.
"We used to cover the body with only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of the population live below the poverty line and the region with the highest and lowest literacy rate in Asia.
It is also the capital of Indonesia.
Panai County is located in the highlands of approximately the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grassberg, is only 60 miles away from here, owned by Felipu McMoran, headquartered in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Phillips launched around $31 billion worth of gold ore and copper.
In addition, Papua's timber resources are rich and have an estimated value of $780 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuans, and the strong military force in Indonesia has been suppressing them all the time.
A 2005 study by The New York Times revealed that Phillips paid nearly $2 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for a single officer.
The Papuans are increasingly intimidated by their demand for independence, which threatens the monarch who is subjected to cruel treatment.
Thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army since 1969, according to activists.
According to the Human Rights Commission in Asia, mass shootings in the 1970s on the Bavaria tribal highlands have been upgraded to genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Presbyterian Presbyterian Presbyterian Church, titled "We Will Lose Everything", summed up evidence of the notorious acts of the previous year, such as outlawing, torture - another report claiming rape and electric activism are particularly common - and the brutal repression of peaceful protests.
“Violent events happen every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims,” said Andrias Hallsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
A large number of migrants outside of Indonesia have been forced to leave the country.
83% of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but after the arrival of Muslim economic immigrants from densely populated Java Island, Kalimantan Island, Sumatra Island, and Sulawesi Island, its population structure has changed.
The Javanese snack accompaniment sells the addition of fried chicken and vegetables mixed with peanuts.
The locals struggled to fight.
24-year-old Panai local Apos Yu moved to the provincial capital Chaya Pradesh to look for a job, he explained, "Those immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables at a lower price than the local Papuans."
This makes the local Papuans, the woman of Papua (mama), lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo (commonly known as Zokovi) pledged at his campaign in 2014 to address the issue of inequality and misuse of functions in Papua.
The former carpenter's path to the President's House of Jakarta is supported by 27 regions in all 29 regions - including Panjai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"We're heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Zokovi, hoping to achieve our wishes and restore justice."
In fact, just two months after Zokovi's appointment in October, Pania had the most terrible nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children from Enarotali sang Christmas songs before the bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly crashed on a motorcycle.
The children were told they had to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers, according to local pastors, was dissatisfied with their speech, and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and the attackers said the drunk soldiers were chasing the children with their guns.
One of the soldiers then shot a gun at the child.
16-year-old Yulianus Yemei was stunned for being severely annihilated.
A few hours later, the nearby Government Election Commission building burned up the bear and the next day the incident rose.
About 1,000 young Cuban men, women and children gathered in front of a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They held a ceremonial bow, jumping over the waita of the Mee Pago tribe in Papua, and mimicking the bird's turrets.
Some protestors began to throw stones at the military reconnaissance whistle.
According to an official document from Times magazine, when emotions continue to ignite, soldiers receive an order via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately." But the document is not issued to the local media.
The 56-year-old Jeremiah, the leader of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, felt that there would be a danger, so he called the crowds to calm down and ask them to come home.
But no one was listening to him.
He stood in the doorway of his colorful and beautiful chalet and told Time magazine, "When I came back, my left wrist suddenly blew up."
Kayama still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he said the bullet came from the gathered soldiers.
He added: "At that time, they had a lot of guns."
According to the brothers of the local Olvús Yore, he witnessed a shot and saw three shots in the body of Olvús Yore.
Yuhanes, sad to tell the Times magazine, "I ran past to check if his body looked like him,
I found out he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Inspector Yujie Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only in the "protection" police station because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, Papua Police Spokesperson and police chief, Phuket Sullistio, said, "When someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves."
This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more were injured.
The next day, the news about the killing was only communicated in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a speech in Cheapura, expressing deep sympathy to the family of the victims, and vowed to resolve the issue of misuse of rights left behind in the history of Papua.
"I hope the case will be resolved as soon as possible, so that it will not happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Secretary for Security, Fernando, said he wanted to establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historic remnants of human rights violations.
However, there is almost no excuse for the demise.
"Most of the attacks took place a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the early 90s and early 2000s.
We are committed to addressing these violations, but this requires a process."
Then on June 5 in Jakarta, Vilando came out of the box in a conversation with The Times, saying he did not have a plan to establish a mechanism of complaint in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be resolved according to the law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Verando for more than 1000 deaths in 1999 in the bloody independence vote in Timor-Leste, but he says 11 cases of human rights violations in the province of Papua have been resolved, including the Panyi Incident.
The family of the victims of the Panyai incident said these words to the nose.
"In the last three years, I have been interviewed four times, but things have not progressed at all," Yuhanes said.
Many years later he said, "I'm tired."
He is now living in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army and I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yucabus also said the people of Pania were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said, "After burying the body, the army came to find me."
The gun did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police attacked the villagers in Deyai district in Pani-I-Nian district.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a stunned man to the hospital, both sides clashed, one died, and the other 17 injured, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Lavianus Dowo, drowns while fishing on the nearby riverside and dies on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's live office.
Police said the villagers had thrown stones at the police, so the police fired a gun.
However, the riot police (the Indonesian military police) began shooting at crowds and one person was killed.
The 29-year-old Dominga Badi told Time magazine, "We were panicking and now we're afraid they'll retaliate." He lived near the hospital and witnessed the injured being rushed to the hospital.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deyai Parliament has called on the police to enact the law and to withdraw the riot police force from the area.
Pania has always been an isolated place for the Indonesian government.
The deficiencies of effective development have increased the discontent of the peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, scattered in the central Highlands of Panai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the people of Papua by dispersing attacks and abduction of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the free Papua movement were born in Pania, including Tardius Uji and Daniel Udas Cogoya.
So in recent years, thousands of Panai people have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty."
Some have not yet appeared.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Panjai is a "tragedy place to be forgotten."
Poverty is growing discontent.
The rice that Anastrotali sells is poor, and the locals can't afford it at all.
The bag is completely inaccessible.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, every woman can take care of four or five potato fields.
They usually use most of the leftovers to sell in the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are only worth 1 million Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
With time, economic inequality has been lifted in the local Papuans and new immigrants, and since the opening of the new route to Napier Airport, the number of these immigrants has increased significantly.
A small amount of work is usually lost to more educated and richer migrants.
There are very few companies in Papua that have the necessary skills to run a competitive company.
John Gobay, Chairman of the Panyai Tribal Council, said, "Young people don't want to stay in this village... because there is no work and no money here."
Papua is separated from the world.
The restrictions on international media coverage remain strong.
Earlier this year, French reporters Frank Escudi and Basel Longchamp were evicted from Papua because they "did not cooperate with the relevant institutions" even though they had rarely been granted permission to shoot.
According to the Asian Deputy Director-General of the Human Rights Watch Organization, Felim Cain said that the election vows for Zorkovi's withdrawal of reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been achieved.
He said in a statement that "if foreign journalists try to report dissatisfaction in the easternmost provinces of Indonesia in Papua and West Papua, they are at new risk: reject visas and pull into blacklists."
No media monitoring means the pressure on the Indonesian government is basically limited to neighboring countries in Papua.
In March, six Pacific states—Tungga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands—requested by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the "common human rights abuses" in Papua, including Panai shootings.
Several countries have also supported the Free Papua movement.
A spokesman for the Indonesian foreign ministry, Almanata Nasir, told Jakarta reporters that "Indonesia is still implementing a democratic system, and freedom of the press, so the evidence of human rights violations is difficult to hide."
Local governments are expected to pay more attention to foreign governments.
On May 4th, when the Dutch Human Rights Ambassador Kise Wan Bar led a delegation of officials to Chayapra, the local people broke the silence and cried out, "We want freedom," he said. He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to return to Zokovi.
The tribal council chairman Goby said, "Zokovi's intentions are good, but he has been involved in the Panai shootings."
He wanted Zokovic to know that the Panjai people not only lived under the threat of a greedy army, but also had nothing to do with education in the region and the lack of public health care services.
Gobay said that the people of Panjai, like the rest of the Papuans, think that the vote they cast to Zokovi is a debt that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threats and fears, the family of the victims of Panai shooting still made their last symbolic resistance: burying a victim body on the face of that military police post office.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let the culprits forget their crimes.
Yucabus lowered his head and said, "My family was killed.
What can we do?"

The fire swallowed Dubai "torch" skyscraper again
On Friday, a fire in one of the world's tallest residential towers forced hundreds of residents to escape the 337-meter, 79-storey ultra-high-rise building.
It is the second large fire in just two years, which is known as the "torch" of the skyscraper.
The building has been evacuated, no reports of injuries have been reported, and no cause of fire has been found.
"We were sleeping, and then we were woken up by fire, and they began to scream.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes from the 50th floor," a resident of George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense agency said the Fire Brigade extinguished the fire at around 4 o'clock in local time (Greenwich Standard Time 0000) and is heating up the building.
The Government is committed to providing shelter to those affected.
The incident could once again raise concerns around the world about the use of external wall materials in high-rise buildings.
A survey conducted by the management of the Torch Skyscraper in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were decorated and insulated with overlays outside the walls.
The British police have said that they believe that the problem with the thermal insulation and overlay system in the Grenfell building in London could be the cause of the rapid spread of the fire in June, a fire that killed about 80 people.
The Williams fleet also suggests that Massa is likely to return, even if he has announced his retirement.
On January 9, only one month left from the opening of the Korea Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, with the Olympic fire from the south to the north of the transmission of precipitation and all kinds of preparation work carried out in a tight drum, the South Korea's winter Olympic atmosphere is increasingly thick.
South Korea is expecting this long-running korean talks to bring a "powder egg" to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in a month.
On November 1st, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics arrived in Korea.
The heat from the fire is directly reflected in the ticket sales at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
More than two months ago, the sales rate of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games remained only 32%, the sales rate of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games is only 4.3%, the low sales rate once made the outside the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games people more worried.
But as the chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee Li Xifan a short time ago for reporters, "With the introduction of the Winter Olympics in all parts of Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics is increasing, and I believe that the sales status of tickets will soon be better."
As of January 3rd, the sales of tickets at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics reached 64%, and the sales of tickets at the Winter Olympics exceeded 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to South Korea, the Ministry of Justice also announced on 8th that it will extend the stay for foreigners visiting the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea for a maximum of 120 days.
More than a fifth of U.S. travelers are carrying prohibited items on board
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20% of passengers had intentionally or unintentionally carried illegal items on board through the U.S. Department of Transportation and Security inspection station, with at least 6% of passengers unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other blades on board.
Less than 1% of passengers reported that they had miscarried with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey was conducted by the chartering company Stratos Jet Charters Inc., and the survey found that young travelers were more likely to ignore the regulations.
197% of respondents who had deliberately carried TSA prohibited items were millennials, compared to less than 15% of Gen X's population.
The most common items that are deliberately bypassed by TSA inspectors are food and beverages.
More than 3% of respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried blades for security reasons, while 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men said they had deliberately carried on board a plane.
The company said that the national traveler was in order to understand the number of passengers who accidentally carried and deliberately carried prohibited items on board the aircraft.
Not surprisingly, the most likely person to carry the unmanned goods over security inspection - intentionally or unintentionally - are those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company pointed out that the TSA guidelines are complex and difficult to understand.
People are generally unsure of what kind of liquid they can carry and how many liquids they can carry.
Therefore, it is not surprising that TSA has the highest number of prohibited liquids.
It has been suggested that TSA could also be considered a ban.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry liquids.
U.S. Secretary of State for Environmental Protection, Pruett, changed his mind about the reductions in the Obama era
After a day of prosecution in 15 states, Commissioner for Environmental Protection Scott Pruitt changed his decision to defer the implementation of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smoke and air pollutants.
Pruett proposed the change because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of environmental regulatory state agencies than the previous government.
He did not mention the legal challenge raised by the Federal Court of Appeals for his previous position.
The focus of the controversy is to set the deadline for each state to begin implementing the 2015 ground ozone standard.
In June, Pruett announced that he would postpone his one-year commitment in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the program and avoid "disrupt local decision-making or hinder economic growth."
Prior to President Donald Trump's appointment, Pruth was the State Attorney General of Oklahoma, and has long resisted strict environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruett has repeatedly turned to block or delay the chemical and fossil fuel industry's opposition.
The sudden regression on Wednesday was one of the latest legal barriers to Prut's re-entry into the agenda.
Last month, the Washington Court of Appeals ruled that the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was seeking to delay the implementation of the provisions of the Obama administration requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruett proposed that he would change his attitude towards the ozone standard, indicating that he would strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency's commitment to cooperating with states and taking complex procedures to achieve the new standard.
Pruett said, "Under the previous government administration, the Environmental Protection Agency usually does not reach the specified period, then such radical groups and other people to prosecute, and then agrees to set a specified timetable through the agreement." He filed dozens of prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
"We do not believe in the supervision of the proceedings, and we take the deadline seriously.
We also take the rules and regulations seriously."
Despite this, a statement from the EPA said that Purdue may use his "extended authorization and all other lawfully available authorizations" again to ensure that each of the provisions complies with "good policies and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing to change the ozone layer regulations on a large scale.
The House of Representatives Act, which was ratified last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rule for at least eight years.
This action has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Prosecutor Eric Schneidermann leads state unions to file a lawsuit with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this week, claiming that it intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's reversal - after we filed a complaint - was a significant victory for the health and safety of 67 million New Yorkers, with more than 1.5 billion American communities directly affected by smoke emissions," said Schneider.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia have joined the case.
Ground ozone is formed by common pollutants emitting from automobiles, power plants, refining plants, chemical plants and other sources that produce reactions under sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke causes serious respiratory problems to sensitive people, resulting in premature death of thousands of people every year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists are welcome to the surprising transformation of Putret.
"What's disturbing is that this cognition measure has been put under tremendous pressure from the sector responsible for protecting the air we need to breathe," said Lori Ann Burd, Center for Biological Diversity.
"We have to fight the Trump administration for the thought movement that caters to pollutants and special interests groups."

In the past two years, the planting area of the mountain has expanded by 30,000 cubits, with a total area of 18 million cubits; at the same time, the development of the outer region, the mountain seedlings in the country to establish the planting base reached 80,000 cubits, an increase of 30,000 cubits than in 2008.
At the same time as the expansion of the planting area, the quality of seedlings is also increasing, sowers storage value is increasing, large specifications, high-quality seedlings retain more, some of the seedlings appear to waste sale phenomenon.
Shi Haiyong also reminds that in the face of the prosperity of the current production and sales, the producers should calmly face, objective analysis, both to see that the demand for flowers and wood will be long-term, increasing, but also to realize that the market competition will be more intense.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, the US company Somaltus filed a complaint with the East Texas District Court for Apple's violation of a battery technology patent for its 2010 application.
The company had previously used the same patent to indict Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony, and Toshiba.
The complaint claims that both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringed a US patent no. 7,657,386, which is called the Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff wishes to receive cash compensation or to receive a patent fee for the alleged infringement of the equipment.
According to the prosecution, the plaintiff seems to think that the iPhone's fast charging function infringes the patent of the company.
iPhone with fast charging function will quickly charge to 80% of the battery, and then charge again.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patented rogue," because the company does not provide obvious products and services, and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have successfully reached an out-of-court settlement with manufacturers such as Ford and Nissan.

Trump has imposed pressure on Mexico to pay for border building costs, according to leaked telephone records
The Washington Post reveals U.S. President Donald Trump's call records with leaders in Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call to Mexico's President, Enrique Pena Nito, Trump urged him to stop saying openly that he would not pay for the cost of building a border wall.
The U.S. president said he was dissatisfied with his open campaign against the segregated wall, saying that Protron said to him, "Don't tell the media."
Trump pledged to build a wall on the southern border of the U.S. in the presidential campaign and vowed to pay Mexico for the project.
His call records with Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Tenmbler were also released, showing tensions between them.
Trump told Tenmbhel that the U.S.'s deal with refugees sending to Australia was "absurd", "unsatisfactory" and "stupid", and he had advised the U.S. to ban refugees from re-establishing, and now hold on to the Obama administration's scorching deal, which would make him look like a "stupid".

Mormons: Activists reincarnate racist private prisons and promote justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car runs through a group of spectators in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, towards the small Mor Beach Bridge.
There were four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and a group of whites with guns marched forward before the car arrived, blocking the road ahead.
The thug's head - a middle-aged man wearing fine striped suits - a deep suction of a cigar, with an eye crumbled into the swirl glass.
The passengers in the car were terrified.
"We want - Roger!" the man exclaimed.
"Drop him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from a passenger seat in the previous row, screaming and breaking the silence.
Fortunately, on July 22nd, this terrible scene was just a repeat of it.
However, when the neck of "Roje" was fitted with a cassette, almost all the spectators around gave a real wheezing sound.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Mor Beach Bridge and reunite the scene of two black couples - Roger and Dorcy Malcon, and George and Mere Dorsey - who had been indicted in 1946 by the three K parties.
No one has been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, even though we have seen them in the community, these years have been hard to believe that no one has been arrested," said Tiron Brooks, who helped organize the re-run.
"This is the stain of history and the burden of our soul."
Brookes, 71, is a former Georgian MP and lifelong rights activist.
For him, repeating is a compelling call to action, reminding the Menlo community that injustice has never been corrected.
"We think of the lawsuit, we want to end the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we must first get justice," he said.
"We have no cure and reconciliation unless we get justice."
On July 27, 1946, a corpse put a bed sheet on the body of a Mor Beach victim.
According to the U.S. National Broadcasting Corporation news, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of engaging in private prisons.
None of them were prosecuted.
Although the suspects have been in a state of impunity for decades, civil rights activists say that the dual motives for the implementation of private punishment are well-known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed Black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in a primary election later that summer.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, about the same time, black man, Roger Malcolm, stabbed to death in a fight against white landlord Barnett Hust - seems to be a woman.
Brookes said that the rumor in the town was that Herst slept with Marcom's wife Dorsey, and her baby wasn't her husband.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on July 25, 1946, the prominent white land lord Loi Harrison spent $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
Thomas and his brother, Mary and George Dorsey, accompanied him to prison.
However, when they returned from prison, as soon as they reached the Mor Beach Bridge, a group of private criminals hurled around.
"The fact is that Harrison was organized and ordered to carry out the murder," a FBI report concluded.
"Clearly, there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that not only participates in murder, destroys the evidence, and hides the identity of the witness."
Brooks is very clear and concise.
He said, "It's a lousy vote."
"They were horrified to kill, and the killer sent a message to the black people in the community: 'If you register and vote, you will also encounter the same ending.''
For more than a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for the annual re-enactment of the private prison case of the Moorbridge Bridge.
Her expression of racism is visibly clear, sturdy, with a deep racism background. Many people want this racism no longer exists in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder, but Green said that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about the private punishment, because the private punishment makes us face the ugly face of all people," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or don't listen to my own experience, I can't build a relationship with you."
Starting in June this year, there were nearly 30 actors on the first day - ten whites, and the rest were blacks - hung in a room and listened to a run-up performance overview from Green.
Weed Malbur serves as a joint director of Green.
For many years, he has played the role of three K's, but he says the role is never easy.
'I feel dirty, because I'm not such a person,' said Margot.
"But I think it's important to keep the freshness of this history because we don't want to go back to that time."
In the room, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, actor of Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, were practising their words.
At the beginning of the game, Malcolm yells and pushes Hearth, and is angry at his wife's sleep.
"Well, I said, roll out my plot!"
Lascona backtrack.
And then they hit.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst out laughing.
Green laughed the most.
'What's going on?' asked Larscona.
He was alarmed and confused.
Am I playing too much?
'No,' said Green.
"I just don't think whites will say 'oh' when they come back."
"Yes," another black actor said.
"Your words must be tough."
In this way, the energy in the room has changed; the feeling of friendship has gone unsatisfactory.
Everyone is trying to do this, not only to show the game, but also to remember the four victims.
The site started again.
This time, Larscona said that the word "ah" was very sharp and powerful.
There is no one to laugh at.
The repetition was quick and effective.
Screaming, gunning, and then, a piece of silence.
A woman in a funeral black dress stands by the actor's body and sings Billy Haradee's mourning word "wonderful fruit."
Her voice overcame other languages.
In addition to a 100-yard code, about 40 people were constantly wiping sweat and tears.
Blacks and whites represent almost half of the population.
There is a couple special program to watch from Isaka, New York, and a lot of people live near the road.
Brookes took them to the tombs of Marcom and Dorcy, about eight hours away, and they all endured the undesirable wetness of Georgia.
Until now, the killer was still a fan. But now, standing on the same land that had a private prison, the air was troubled.
When the last note of the song disappears, Green invites people to check the bodies played by the actors.
The children lower their heads, look at the fake blood and body, and lie to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy muttered, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and the show ended.
The actor shakes off the prison rope and wipes his tears.
Brad Shaw is holding the men's maroons as the target of the three K party head.
Nick Larscona hugs his two colleagues and weeps in their arms; the emotions in the show end up infecting him.
"There's nothing to do," one of the women whispered.
"We know your heart isn't like that.
There's a reason you do this."
After that, the audience sat down to dinner with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chat with a black couple they just met about repetition.
Dennis Doprinski finds it difficult to find words to describe how she feels after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and actions... it's something people like you say and do, because they look like you," she said.
'It really made me think that the private prison was still going on for me,' she added. 'Now it's called police shooting.'
In the room, Tiron Brooks sat next to the table watching, tasting and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he plans to perform next year.
"Repetition is an inspiring way because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this may happen again.
Those who do not study and do not understand their own history are doomed to repeat it."
For the reform of the natural gas market, the importance of "independence of the tube network" reform is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also larger.

U.S. media: China Air Force Engineering University scientist studies laser satellite for the removal of space debris
On January 18, the Chinese media said that Chinese scientists proposed a bold and innovative proposal to clean up the messy orbit of the earth using large lasers, destroying old satellites and their sky garbage.
According to the U.S. Newsweek website on January 15 reported that China Air Force Engineering University researcher wrote a paper entitled "Sky-based laser to clear small-scale spatial fragmentation model study", the paper describes how by the use of Sky-based platform laser, spatial fragments can be photographed by lasers into smaller, less dangerous fragments.
Over the years, space debris has always been a concern for international space agencies, and NASA has considered a variety of options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris.
The way to clear large-scale spatial debris includes the giant net used to clean and collect waste, as well as the magnets that can be used to pump them out of orbits. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this will be an effective way to clean orbits of the earth.
Abstract of this paper said: " (simulation research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of Sky-based platform laser removal space fragment technology."
A 2014 study by the US defense giant Lockheed-Martin found that there were about 200 threats per day for satellites running on orbits.
The high-speed debris along the orbital movement is considered a serious threat to the space mission of the future, and is described as a "fatal series of threats" by European Space Agency experts.
According to the U.S. Mass Machinery monthly website on January 17, space is basically empty, but the space that is close to the earth is becoming more and more crowded. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris that runs around the earth, and as time goes on, the debris will pile up.
The more fragments, the higher the chance that a satellite that is still in normal operation will be fragmented, thus destroying or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
All space agencies have developed plans to eradicate space debris in the future, according to the report.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris, so that it is out of orbit, Europe is considering launching a large network of satellites, capturing debris, bringing back the earth, Japan's idea is to use a electric chain to capture debris.
At the same time, China also proposed a way to solve space debris, that is, use a large laser to hit the space debris floating into less harmful pieces.
According to a group of researchers from China Air Force Engineering University published a paper in the German Journal of Optics, installing such a laser on a satellite will be sufficiently and effectively clean up space, at least according to the simulation results.
The only way to prove validity is to test it. There is no arrangement for such a task at the moment, but maybe someone will install a laser on the satellite and then send it to space.
Once it is done, we can eventually begin to eliminate the problem of space debris forever.

Macy Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time to discuss the possible future of the war
The most striking boxing games under 147 pounds will be held in the near future, with Vasily Lomachenko and Mike Garcia meeting for the first time on Thursday in a state of conflict.
In the independent rooms of the ESPN office in Los Angeles, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead down the hallway to congratulate the world boxing organization super lightweight champion Lomachenko.

"Champion, how are you?"
I wish you the best of luck."
In the ESPN game on Saturday night at 7 p.m., Lomachenko won Miguel Mariaga and secured his position.
When the two took a photo, Egys Klimmas, the broker of Lomachenko, pointed out that the potential confrontation between the two players depends on the "perfect size."
'I used to be a lightweight person,' said Gasiatorial.
"I went up against Brona (140 lbs), but my weight wasn't that great.
Compared to 140 pounds, my weight is a little lower.
I want to go back to the light level.
He must reach a light weight (135 lbs), then we can fight.
This is what the fans want as well.
We are satisfied with them."
Lomachenko has agreed to this.
"The boxing world needs this fight."

"Because all the fans are asking this question, this battle may be a pay-per-click charge," Garcia said. He then expressed an open attitude towards the online competition that offers the best financial solutions.
"We are the main characters.
No one can create such a great deal of concern.
As long as they are ready...”
Garcia appreciates Lomachenko as a "excellent player" and may be able to watch his Saturday boxing game live.

Gasia said that the focus was to show the power of the fist and then the boxing.
They all said they could feel the power of their own boxing game.
"This is a battle to be fought,
Attention and heat are not available in other boxing games.
I'm very happy to participate," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top wrestlers, this time to Macky.
This is going to be a great fight."

The latest results of the Swedish Age Assessment for Asylum Seekers
The Swedish refugee test uses the latest methods to assess their age from medically, and the latest results suggest that more than 80% of the subjects are judged to be over 18 years old, but not all believe their accuracy.
The R?tsmedicinalverket (R?tsmedicinalverket) was launched earlier this year.
The Swedish Immigration Agency (Migrationsverket) designed these tests after failing to accurately assess the age of some of the minors claiming to be minors in order to make a more accurate age assessment during the avoidance process.
To date, the Swedish Immigration Service has sent 6880 test takers, and the Center for Forensic Medicine has announced the results of a total of 2481 test takers between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
80% (2002 people) are considered 18 years of age or older, but in the other 25 cases, the Swedish National Center for Forensic Medicine also determines that the subject of the test "may be 18 years of age or older."
In the 432 case test, the result is that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The test is only for people who have doubts about age.
According to the Center for Forensic Medicine, these results are consistent with the previous months' results.
He told The Local: "These data are not too different from the data from the previous months, and the numbers are very consistent."
Cases over the age of 18 do not necessarily indicate that these asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the center published 581 test results, which were called 442 "signing that the subject was 18 years of age or older."
Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 test results published, and found that 243 of them had publicly stated that they would be 18 or older this year.
The X-ray examination of the teeth, the link to the magnetic resonance scan, and then by the dentist and radiologist analysis of the results, this method of medical assessment is also questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects is Caroline College's endocrinologist, Claude Marcus, whose work includes evaluating people's biological maturity to determine whether they are older or later than their normal age experience adolescence.
He told the newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I think the measurement method I used should not be like that.
In this way, the physiological age is very inaccurate.
"If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it."
However, Glenson, the Center for Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of these tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small."
The biggest risk is that the person is under the age of 18, which accounts for about 10%.

"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think we've made some progress, but it's not the time to reinstate Russia's eligibility," said the General Assembly, who supported the project team's recommendations.
"We need to do everything we can to normalize the situation in the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been to separate white athletes from contaminated systems," he added.

What are the implications for the transition from football to Paris (Neymar)?
The rule designed to prevent unrestricted expenditures at the European Homeless Football Club will not hinder the transfer from Barcelona Club in Spain to Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG) in France at record prices.
The consequences of this are that the UEFA is further downgraded to the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. The UEFA is the governing body of the European Football Games and has the right to ban all teams from participating in the highly-attended UEFA.
The FFP, launched by the UEFA in 2011, means that the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club must eventually prove that the transfer of Nemar receives funding without causing huge losses.
Barcelona Club has already paid €2.22 billion ($2.62 billion) just to pay the Brazilian player's settlement fee, and Nemal's salary will be up to USD 10 million a year.
Below are some of the financial implications of the transfer to France.
Considering that the team's funding comes from the crude Qatar governing family, the Paris Saint-Germain football club can, of course, sign a cash deal with Nemar, and join him in the battles of other stars.
Clubs can spend a lot of money to buy players, but they must make use of legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge amount of money they spend, so that they achieve a profit-making balance on the relevant business of football.
The Financial Fair Play Rules were proposed by Michel Platini after he was elected President of the United Nations in 2007.
The former French player believes that for those clubs that are debt-ridden for the pursuit of success, if banks or owners withdraw their support funds, they are actually at risk of fraud, putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the rule moved from the issue of club debt to the monitoring of the loss status of the club.
This change means that Roman Abramovich's business model used to acquire Chelsea clubs in 2003, i.e. to buy a potential club, then spend a fortune to improve the team and build a global brand, now facing a more demanding situation.
During the three-year rule evaluation period as of 2018, the club may lose €30 million.
Despite the loss of Abu's then-chairman in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to stopping excessive expenses.
"Of course, the Rules have not yet expired, and we will definitely strengthen the regulations of the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the related matters of the Rules last week.
Although the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay the closing terms of the sale of Nemar in one go, it can also be allocated for accounting purposes within the contract period.
Nemal has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee may be shown in the annual accounts for the next five years as a fee of €44,400 million.
The first wave of Rule sanctions implemented in 2014 has put the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and Manchester City Club under Abu Dhabi under the strictest sanctions.
The Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was sentenced to a fine of EUR 6 million ($82 million at the current exchange rate), and subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and demanded that the team of Champions in the 2014-15 season reduce the player to 21, rather than a normal 25 player.
The United Nations looks closely at the clubs that are trying to increase revenue by tackling owners of clubs, frauding financial regulators.
While Qatar's companies can sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, the Europa League will not treat it as a legitimate income.
This is what happened in 2014, when the European Union ruled that the Qatar Tourism Board sponsored the Paris Saint-Germain football club to exaggerate the amount.
According to the report, part of the income from football clubs in Paris in Saint-Germain may come from payments from the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, both the Paris Saint-Germain football club and the group committee denied that Nemar would be the World Cup ambassador, and it was easy to make such a move for the European Union's regulatory bodies.
The recent sanctions against the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club mean that the UEFA will be more vigilant of any attempt to break the rules.
The European Union has not discussed the transfer with the Paris Saint-Germain football club in advance.
The above persons are only contacted by the Associated Press in an unnamed capacity, as they are not authorized to discuss the status of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
The last published accounts show that the Paris Saint-Germain football club operating revenue for 2015-16 was €5.424 billion and profited more than €10 million.
Accounts for the previous accounting year have not yet been announced.
The Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects that Nemar's membership will bring the gospel to sponsoring events, franchises and jersey sales.
The club is expected to increase its revenue by at least 30%.
It is clear that the Spanish Union is angry to see one of the most famous players leaving, trying to block the action in Nemar, and claiming that the Paris Saint-Germain football club violates the Rules.
Mr. Havir Tebas, Chairman of the Liga League, told the Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of the 'financial initiator', the club and the country are the same", referring to Qatar, who has ultimate ownership over the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
Arsene Wenger, who is the owner of the club for the U.S. Athletic Tycoon, retains his views on the state's approach to the Liga League.
"This is the result of ownership, which completely changed the entire ecosystem of football in the past 15 years," Wang said Thursday.
"Once a state has a club, what will happen?"
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules because for a country there are many different ways or various benefits to require a large card player to represent a country."

The Aged Infectious Wind Market - Harrah Summer Camp and The Detectives
The story is reminiscent of the actor's 80s light years and the 90s garbage era (before and after David Wein and Michael Schwart for the MTV sketch comedy "National"); but also the reminiscent of the ancient self, sorry for 2001; before this year, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller, and Paul Luther have not yet been born.
As a cultural piece of art, it is the imitation and emulation of the eternal memory of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
The first day of camp was aired strongly, but it wasn't just because of its absurd humor (the plot is about the original story of a can of vegetables that would speak, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
Double the use of core jokes in the plot - middle-aged actor playing as a child of the age of trickery - which makes it impossible to go back to the past and become part of the joke.
After ten years, adults are actually playing adults, emotions are not too deep, imitations are also more scattered, including improvisation of the 90s tracking the movie, such as the hand that pushes the cradle.
At some point, a character falls into an Apple notepad, some straight skates, and "some other things in 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetheart (Mr. Shuwart) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrodo).
Viktor (Ken Marino jewelry) still holds the man's body.
Another serious conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Shuwart) was apprehensive by George H. W. Bush (Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of this series is interpolation.
Seeing this always young Mr. Luther was particularly interesting, and he showed off Matt Dillon's soul mate in the movie "The Lonely Gem," and before "The Campus Giants", Andy now felt like a giant.
It's a crazy time, and it may be a driving force for the film, like the seven years of life series, until the conclusion that I think logically: Harrah's Summer Camp: Two decades later, its final scene is to let Cass to see Harrah's Summer Camp's movie premiere.

This is a wonderful idea.
This is not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (the police watch the TV in the lower chess to play time because Americans like to play football).
And there are many celebrities voice actors - including Jenny Slater, Nick Overman, Mahersah Hashbatz Ali and Kolo Severni - to create a wonderful sound festival.
However, Detective Dominion is so committed to building a hustle and bustle propaganda comedy - a killer with a head-derrygan mask - and it usually plays such a role as well.
The six-episode TV is slightly dragged, and the comedy effect is not released quickly or frequently.

The Bank of England will maintain an interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, with the sluggish economic growth and loose inflation already rising hope to destruct.
The Bank of England warned that as it tightened its control of interest rates on household income, growth would continue to be "weak".
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)'s decision to maintain an interest rate of 0.25% on 6-2 votes, while a small number of members called for an increase in interest rates this month, even though weak economic growth has weakened the upside.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced the 2017 and 2018 growth forecasts to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and issued a warning that household income tightness will continue, while inflation will surge to nearly 3% in autumn.
However, in the coming years, interest rates will need to be raised to curb inflation from Europe, while borrowing costs may need to be increased significantly as expected in the financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented, and members of the vote decided to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce a suspension of its regular financing plan to provide low-cost funding to banks starting in February next year, although the bank said it would now need to add another £11.5 billion to the bank's basis.
In the records of the Interest Rate Decisions Conference, Bank of England said: "In MPC's core forecasts, GDP is still weak in the near future, as the tightening of households' actual income will continue to repress consumption."
Regarding interest rates, the bank repeatedly reiterates the need for a "certain monetary policy tightens" to crack inflation, and the need to "greater" than the market expects.
The market is expected to achieve first growth in the third quarter of next year and the second time in 2020.
However, the line emphasized that any raise would be "slow" and "restricted".
This year and next year's growth forecasts are trending downward, compared with May's forecasts for 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintained a 1.8% growth forecast for 2018.
The British pound lowered the US dollar exchange rate, followed by the euro.
The pound's exchange rate fell 0.5% to 1.31, while the euro fell 0.4% to 1.11.
Before the unchanging decision-making took place, the rising expectations were destructed due to the recent undesirable growth data. GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with just 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said the growth in the third quarter could be kept at 0.3%, although at the end of the year it will be slightly higher.
The average household is affected by the surge in inflation, and the salary growth is small and insignificant, the Bank of England's recent inflation report did not bring them joy, because the line called tightening before the change has become worse,
It is also said that monetary policy "can't prevent" the fight against income in the next few years, but the salary is expected to "restore" when the three-year forecast ends.
At the same time, because of the pound sterling value, the demand for British goods significantly increased, the economy will be stimulus, offset some of the effects of low consumption.
The year before the decision, the shocking referendum of the European Union's nationals plunged the British pound, down to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to fully impact the price and the British economy.
Before the bank announced its latest interest rate ruling, the call for an increase in interest rates is not overheard, as inflation has increased the pressure on ordinary households that have already doubled, while the three decision makers called for the increase in interest rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month's inflation dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank of England said it was expected and will rise again in the next few months.
The line said its target was 2%, and the more than part of it was already the final bottom line of the pound, which was completely wet.

Now health services organizations will provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to provide funding for the trial after the Court of Appeal supported the High Court ruling last year. The ruling said that although the NHS claims that local authorities should provide funding for the drug, the NHS has the right to pay for the cost of PrEP.
The move announced on Thursday was called a "major new intervention" by British NHS CEO Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust Foundation (NAT) described it as a "major moment."
Sexual health clinics such as London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered sex health clinics. More clinics will be added in October, followed by a full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention drugs (PrEPs) are HIV drugs that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of infection with HIV.
The test showed that PrEP significantly reduces the spread of HIV in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means having enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible to receive treatment include homosexuals, bisexual men, transgender people, and those who are not successful in receiving treatment.
The clinic will determine whether participants of the test, including men, women, transgender people, and their sexual partners, are eligible for antiretroviral treatment for unknown persons.
People who live and register as a general practitioner in England may also register at a sex health clinic in their country.
The plan will cost £10 million, and the NHS England Branch has signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after international competitive sourcing.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
"This significant new intervention should play a broad and increasingly successful role in the prevention of HIV," said Stevens.
This is another milestone worth making progress in addressing the major health challenges of mankind for more than 30 years."
"This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS," said Jim, Chief Executive of the UK AIDS Trust (NAT).
If it is actually targeted at people in need and at risk, pre-exposure prevention drugs provide the possibility to change the British AIDS epidemic.
Since September, the high-risk HIV population will receive a new permitted tool through an NHS-funded, England-based experiment, which is truly independent and does not need to be negotiated with a sex partner, which will bring improvements to the lives of many people.
We agree with this statement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Trenches Higgins Foundation, said: "The first priority now is to ensure that the test is rapidly rolled out nationwide, and that no person with HIV can fall.
Now that we have purchased PrEP trials, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk from HIV."
"After months of delays and government drags, PrEP's initial trial work is welcome and should come sooner," said Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson.
Evidence shows how this drug can change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and preventing the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This test will give us a better understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now, it is very important to launch the test as soon as possible nationwide to protect people living with HIV and to help us further stop the spread of HIV in our society."

High-quality life: the application of the penthouse and clever design, to create the little apartment of the Earl's Palace as a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, is passionate about renovating her house. In 2014, she moved from the large house on the rider bridge to the small apartment on the Earls Court.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style terrace - Joanne does not pack and sell it, which is a strong proof of the new design.
'Before that, I lived with my ex-boyfriend in a larger house on the rider bridge,' said Joanne.
"I was looking for the right house.
I saw this apartment at the Earls Court and its ceiling is also very high.
I would like to make an appointment that day."
The 1,000-square-foot apartment has been fully renovated since its first look.
The apartment was originally a complex single that needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - at that time, Joanne wanted to increase storage space and penthouses to make the most of the ample ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.
"That's my request," she said.
For this reason, she hired Elvan Azadi from Duck & Shed's Architecture and Design Studio (located in the Notting Hill) to make use of this 12.5-foot ceiling to carefully build a home. The home is not only a development project, but also a Jonny's place of residence.
The ceiling height is not enough to add up to two spaces up and down, so the building challenge is to create a penthouse that is highly enough for people to stand up.
Elvin must be creative in order to solve this problem.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explained.
"We have to arrange the space to show it up and down, and there is no need for a shoulder bow back.
Not only is it so simple to build a simple platform, but it is also necessary to start these steels so that they are around the right height to implement the functionality."
With this arrangement, Elvin was able to get two full-body rooms in the space - which can add a lot of fun elements.
The penthouse overlooks the charming living area with retrouvius-branded copper windows.
The golden furniture with mirrors, silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille's retro lighting laid the whole style.
The use of the mirror plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
A mirror on both ends of the short corridor can make it look longer.
The kitchen is equipped with a mirror guard like a window to another room.
In the front door, the small grid with a mirror provides Joanne storage space for tableware and glassware storage.
A nice living room with an intriguing sense of space and the kitchen can be picked up when not in use.
The dining room is not fresh.
But the uniqueness of this folding kitchen lies in a garage-style lift.
"Here is some knowledge in the field of engineering," Elvan explained the steel reinforced surface MDF door.
"This uses the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne received an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom, and an improved layout.
"In the end, you're selling the size of the house -- or the valuation of your property based on the size of the house," Elvan said.
"Basically, the real estate broker will go into the room and calculate according to the size of the floor."
They will try to increase the space, while using high-quality materials, which will give the space a luxurious feeling.
Elvin said, "Materials are your own choice, so they help create emotional hubs at home."
"You don't like the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't break your heart."
The fact is that with good design and extra space, the standard apartment can make you feel astounded.
In fact, you might be able to choose to stay with Joanne.

Two brothers staged a $5 billion real estate empire to fight for the war
After 40 years of its Italian family's founding dynasty, the two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $5 billion.
Colin De Lutis, a former director and developer of the Calton Football Club, lived in a mansion in the Tukala district, where three doors were located at his brother Paul's residence. The latter brought him to the Supreme Court regarding the division of their real estate and business assets.
Since 2014, Paul has been willing to leave the family business, but the two brothers have heated discussions about the asset division in the Supreme Court.
The two brothers and their mother had a total of 38 real estate properties worth more than $5 billion, which have accumulated since the family purchased Smith Street in the Collingwood area in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually developed it to the size of 160 retail chain stores.
In 1999, the company sold for $8500 million.
Then, the money was put into the real estate. Currently, the portfolio of assets of the De Rudis family includes the Urban Office, the Brunswick and Sorrento development projects, the Gold Coast and the Bull Mountain Apartments, and the suburbs shopping mall.
According to an agreement with his late father, Paul, whose brother Paul is called De Ruttis, the "major promoter and dominant character" of the family, owned about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul accounted for about one-third of the company's assets.
Filed with court filings, it says Colin has a $3.16 billion worth of property and Paul has a $1.76 billion worth of property.
Paul believes that the separation of real estate and cash is the symptom of commensurate negotiations.
"The proposed property division proposal for Colin left him the best property I could think of," he wrote in a first court oath in 2015.
On Friday, the Supreme Court held a hearing for the first time after several mediation failures.
The two brothers are still fighting for the control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out of the game.
Colin denied it and accused Paul of failing to manage certain real estate.
In the early oaths submitted by Colin, he said he wanted to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian tradition decided that family was the most important option. My Italian family decided that family was the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case is on the rise, and there are hundreds of pages of oaths, emails, and corporate reports submitted by top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, as well as senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. De Rudis and her late husband, Louise, are both Italian immigrants. They have operated plentiful restaurants and delicacies since the late 50's and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 70's.
They used collateral to buy Collinwood properties, where Collin opened the family's first denim store.
Colin said, "I read it three times," and he started Westco there. "At that time, Paul was still small (about 10 years old).
Anna De Rudis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to pass their property on peacefully to their son.
"Luigi always told me that he would never want his brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two brothers, Mark and Luke are no longer members of the De Rudis group of companies, and Colin said that Mark paid him $1 million when he left the company and $26 million to Luke.
Luke and Mark both expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of the split of their property, Paul said.
According to TV star Eddie McGuire to his biography published in 2015, though Colin was a former board member of the AFL Club, he has maintained a downgrade.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their attorneys on Friday.
However, only Colin responded via text message. He said that because the case was submitted to the court "I can't really say too much."
"My brother Paul chose to prosecute me and brought our family affairs to court, which is very, very difficult," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he tried to meet his brother's requirements.
"Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I end up with such a dispute," he added, "but he still has hope for the resolution of the dispute."
On Friday, the hope seems to be destroyed.
"Our problems will be resolved by the court in the near future," Collins wrote.

Trump's new term of office limits President's media time
Others tried, but all failed.
John F. Kelly may be able to do that.
If that is the case, then he is the first.
According to the U.S. Political News website Politico, the new White House mayoral plan to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including press reports - to ensure that the bosses are more stable.
Here's a quote from the journalist Josh Dawson:
"When the new president of the White House, John F. Kelly, began to work on the first day with senior officials, he pointed out that he would address a major issue of President Trump's entry into the White House: misinformation in the hands of the President."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information can help the president make better decisions, so the information needs to be at his hand - whether in writing or in brief.
Kelly's diagnosis is similar, but others have tried to subdue him by monitoring Trump's media time, but in the end it ended with a failure.
President Trump's TV addiction has been around for a long time - now in the White House, where the habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, former running consultant Sam Naberg told Politico, "If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, then let him know that he will also get positive reports on credible channels."
Politico's Tara Palmery wrote at the time, "Based on the experience of six former running officials, the focus of controlling Trump's Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media messages are always included with a certain compliment."
This is not a problem at all.
But Trump's Twitter habits have been "controlled" this view is really ridiculous.
Maybe these running officials know something we don't know - that's if they don't have their intervention, Trump's tweets will even get even more hot.
We may never know those tweets that Trump hasn't sent.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even if only a few times, his efforts were worth it.
But no one can stop Trump from debating.
A part of the problem lies in the fact that in a white house composed of mutually competitive groups, people promote their worldview by submitting information that may or may not be reliable to Trump.
Politico - all about the story - in May reported counsellors' hobbies on the strategic provision of suspicious information to the president.
Here's an example of what the journalist Shane Goodman described:
"Now with former Trump officials, Trump's response to negative news clips such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, would be crazy to find out its source.
At the end of February, someone deliberately copied an article on the website of GotNews.com, a cyber inciting actor Charles C. Johnson, to the President, who was accused of a "source of large amounts of information leaking," when Trump was doing so.
Even though Johnson has been permanently blocked by Twitter for harassment, he does not provide any specific evidence and he has exploded a large number of faults and later denied it publicly.
Trump looked at the article and began to ask officials about Walsh's situation."
Mr. Goodman also said that at that time, the Secretary of State for Defence and the White House, Mr. Robert Porter, tried to establish a system to manage and record the documents received by Trump.
What is the result?
Kelly intends to do the same after three months.
He may prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Pribras, but Trump is the imposing Trump, and his assistants are still competing against each other and fighting for influence.
These permanent effects can make Kelley's mission more difficult.

Italy's strong attitude towards non-governmental immigrant rescue ships
Italy warns non-governmental organizations of operating a Mediterranean immigrant rescue ship that they will not continue to carry out the rescue without signing new rules of action.
In an interview with the Turin Daily Journal, the Minister of Home Affairs, Marco Minniti, said: "If the NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it is difficult to see how they will succeed."
On the day before the warning was issued, the Italian official, suspected of the German aid organization's "young rescues" ship crew actually collided with the crowds to assist illegal immigrants and detained them.
The aid organization operates only for one year and refuses to comment on the subject of specific allegations by Italian prosecutors Ambrogio Caltosio.
The organization said in a social media statement, "To us, saving lives is now and will be the most important thing in the future, so we are sorry that we are unable to operate in the search area at this time."
"After collecting all the information, we can only now assess all charges and situations."
Italy has been monitoring the Iuventa number of the Youth Assistance Organization since October.
His crew were suspected of carrying a human-handling mercenary directly from a small ship and allowed smuggling to escape and re-use the ship.
According to the prosecutor's records, it is said that at least one such meeting occurred at sea 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya.
His crew were suspected of having publicly disregarded the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which was driven by humanitarian enthusiasm rather than any other motive to oversee the rescue operations in the region.
According to the Code of Conduct, only an Italian police officer is clearly required to monitor their activities on board the vessel.
Currently, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct, which are: Save the Children, Malta-based Immigration Marine Assistance Station and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said Thursday that it considers that the new provisions are not necessary, but acceptable, because they will not bring any "significant changes and obstacles to their rescue operations."
The Nobel Prize-winning organization (MSF) was rejected.
At the same time, Minneapolis said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has declined in recent weeks, indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and the combined efforts of local mayors have been first seen.

Michel Carter, 20, has been sentenced to 15 months in prison and can be suspended for another 5 years after the expiration of the term.
Carter was sentenced to unintentionally non-predictive murder against Conrad Roy in June, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said in a hearing on Thursday: "My family is sad.
"My son is my best friend."
While waiting for the appeal, Carter is entitled to personal freedom.
She faces a prison sentence of up to 20 years, but her lawyers believe that she and Mr. Roy both have mental illnesses.
At the decision, Carter stood up, wearing red trousers and beige hoodies, with his hands tied, his eyes with tears, looking downward.
"Her behavior killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life for the better.
"She has no responsibility," the prosecutor said.
"She doesn't have any regrets."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible result, and she was very sorry."
However, Lawrence Moniz said he didn't find her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness could have any significant impact on her behavior."
A prosecutor read a statement from Lynn Roy, the mother of Roy, saying, "I haven't had a day when I'm sad to lose my beloved son."
I hope he is proud of me and all that he has done for me. I am working hard to stand together in all my sufferings with his sisters, which will accompany us forever," the statement said.
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "spiritually angry" because she realized that she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become her child's aunt.
"The loss of a person who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and my last life will be with that pain," she said.
The case appears to have pioneered the law, as the laws of Massachusetts do not enshrin the conviction of others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in the car.
Carter's text revealed that after she confessed that she committed suicide, the case sparked national concern.
"There are many ways to hang, jump, stab yourself," she said in a few text messages two weeks before her death; at that time he was on vacation with his family.
The time before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," "All you have to do is start the generator and then get free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter gained great attention through the death of Mr. Roy, and ordered that she would not profit from the case through any media.
There are legal differences in this case.
Amanda Knox, one of the few people defended for Carter, was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was declared innocent two years later.
Ms. Nox, 30, said in a column in the Los Angeles Times, "Michel Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment."
Zhangyi was destined to be a controversial film artist, since he began filming the first film "Red Goth", he has been leading the trend of Chinese film, but also received a lot of disputing.
The reporter learned from the Lhasa Netball Club that recently, Lhasa Netball Juniors won the fourth place in the National Youth Basketball League Finals held in Beijing.
Lhasa Netball Youth Team consists of 11 local players, the main coach is the assistant coach of Lhasa Netball adult team.
Tibetan "basketball boy" before taking part in the finals in Beijing.
General manager of Lhasa Netball Club, Leung Chun-cheung, said that compared with last year, the team's achievements have improved, and the player's confidence and grasp of the stadium have been significantly improved. The player's communication with other teams is also more comprehensive, and there is more, easier, and in-person exchanges.
At the end of the match, the team leader, Gang Tzu, said he wanted to do his best for Tibet's basketball career by participating in the competition.
According to the Beijing competition, players overcame factors such as low altitude oxidation and showed the image of Tibet.
Even though the track is a gold medal in the Olympic Games, the track gets in the sky, but the track name will be lower than the suction of gold.
Automakers are facing an impact and Audi will be renovating up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the renovation, BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW believes that "driving with more intelligent options rather than restrictions" means all major European cities - including BMW headquarters in Munich - to consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would change three million cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company has claimed this as a recall.
European automakers are strongly promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions requirements.
However, nitrogen oxides emissions from diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can lead to asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel car tail gas emissions is also increasing, so it is difficult to maintain the competitiveness of diesel car in the price.
With German automakers facing review, the government led by Prime Minister Angra Merkel has also been accused of putting too much pressure on these powerful automakers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the public's overriding, i.e. masking their use of so-called failure devices, adjusting emissions during vehicle testing to comply with regulations, and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
A number of Volkswagen executives have been accused in the United States, while others are being investigated by the Atlantic State.
The former head of the Odysseus Motor R&D department was arrested in Germany last month.
Former manager Zacchero Giovani Pamio is an Italian and is therefore not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, and the German government accused Audi of installing the system to escape European emissions requirements, expanding previously only to the U.S. scope of investigation.
Audi was investigated to have a significant impact on the public: luxury car manufacturers accounted for a disproportionate profit share of the public's cars.
A movie is prepared to be released, from one year to two years, which can be called a common practice.
The animated film, "The Big Fish Sea Tong", is scheduled to be released on July 8th, this movie is 12 years from the time of preparation to the release!
"Big Fish Haitang" original author Liang Yun, at the age of 21 from Tsinghua University's thermal energy professional spin, and friend Zhang Chun together to establish the other day, in 2008, obtained the joint venture to source millions of dollars of risk investment, launched the animated film actress "Big Fish Haitang".
The film has won numerous domestic and foreign awards at the stage of the creative sample, and has been interviewed by the French Pompidou Contemporary Art Center and praised as one of the "most outstanding works of art".
Since the film has been in production for six years, the fans who have been waiting for the movie to come out are called the "sacred pit".
The Big Fish Haitang tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese people. With the announcement of this trailer, it also brings new expectations to all the audience.
"These 12 years have only done this, and now it has become a reality from a dream, and I am both nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun said: "The old idea is to use one-fifth of other people's budget, to make the same picture as others, the team will be forced to me."
Dongguan, the "world factory" that used to rely on feed processing and a large number of ordinary workers, is looking at those who can lead the city to reposition the high level of talent.
On the week of high-level talent activities held by the Dongguan City Government, the first financial reporters saw that some of the local strong enterprises had a chance to participate in the talent talks.
In the orange red background walls, on the bright billboards under the hood, they each marked a price point.
Accordingly, the Chinese Television Industry Association decided to sign a self-regulatory treaty with the United National TV drama production industry.
Provence Lavender is Threatened by Climate Change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is a bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
Due to continuous drought and the presence of insects carrying viruses, lavender is failing, which makes the scientists and peasants who are trying to find a solution no headache.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence Institute for Agricultural Research (CRIEPPAM), said: "The lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat, as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with heavy rainfall in spring and heavy rain in autumn.
This will affect the life cycle of the lavender.
There is also a smaller lobe of the body, a lice that can spread small bacteria, and in very dry weather, they will appear in a large number."
The main factor is its size.
In addition to attracting vacationers, lavender oil is sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric? Chase said: "In contrast to plants that can open a lot of flowers, with a long valley top, we have smaller individuals, poor development, missing or weak.
So our essential oil content is less."
The solutions being studied include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the evaporation of soil moisture, a protective blend of spraying clay and water on plants, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
Compared to the science fiction elements in the movie, the two star casts are more appealing to the story of the movie.
On the afternoon of September 5th, the Chinese Wall Street Journal spoke to many famous people in the acoustic world, and two artists of acoustic performances, surprisingly, they almost remained silent.
One is a Berlin movie star, one is a rising youth actor, and psychological crime is the first appearance of Liu Van and Li Yifeng.
Mexico's high-risk journalists killed
All employees of the Riodace Weekly meet on Wednesday to reflect on their reporting plans for the riots in the State of Sinalos, which are caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials, and the endless war on drugs.
But today, the tragedy of the shadows hid themselves, and they gathered together to discuss safety issues.
It is important to be informed to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what makes them feel more secure: whether they should take their children to the office (the office had been attacked by grenade in 2009), or whether they should leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals, and allies.
They let these journalists name each column—no evidence, observation, and intuition are sufficient.
The drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government list, or Qatar, are making reports in Mexico dangerous.
The violence has never stopped, the national body has spread across the wilderness, with more and more journalists: According to the records of the Protection Press Committee, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Beina Nito left office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been protected by the federal government after being attacked and threatened; and to date, at least 7 journalists have died in seven states.
The former was their editor and source of inspiration, and the co-founder of Riodace Havir Waldiz Cadenas.
Valdiz wrote a lot of books on drug violence, and one of them wrote: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist."
Everyone can feel deeply that he has left, although he is everywhere - a huge picture hangs on the front of the office building of Riodace, with the words "justice"; the T-shirts worn by Alan Ivara and Miliam Ramirez, two 30-year-old reporters, also show his smile on his t-shirt, his glasses or his iconic Panama straw hat.
The seminar was held less than two months after his death; journalists were talking about their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and suspicions.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, the office was only prosecuted in accordance with the records of the Protection of Journalists Committee.
Most of the thousands of criminal cases each year involve drug abuse and organized crime, so it is rarely possible to smuggle the killers of journalists.
In Riodace, they persisted in reporting the violence in the state of Sinalo, although they were heartbroken, although the land had been thousands of holes.
Ibarra said that there is no killer information, there is no justice, so holding a security discussion is not very useful.
He said: "It's really stupid to waste time participating in such a seminar.
"As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdiz left the office of the capital's Riodoce in Culiacan.
His red Toyota Carola had only opened several neighborhoods and had been hanged by two men; they forced him to get off the bus and drove 12 guns, guessing because of the name of the newspaper - translated into The Twelve Rivers.
The gangster left his car and destroyed it near it.
Valdiz is 50 years old.
He was preceded in death by his wife and two children.
The Kuliacan flux is four.
However, there is nothing in Valdiz other than silence.
Since he was arrested and extradited to the United States in January last year, the state of Sinalo has become the country's bloodiest battlefield, and the enemy forces have been stunned.
One or several people were killed every day on the streets of Sinalo, and the graveyard was filled with two tombs, which have become commonplace.
temporarily forgetting that the "peaceful" state was when only one Carter controlled this coastal state and its port and drug route to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdiz is deeply aware of the dangers of the work, 60-year-old Riodace co-founder and director Ismel Bohquet is guilty of not protecting his friends.
There are two mistakes that lead to this tragedy.
First, in February, he published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who led a group of Katels who fought against several sons and daughters of Guzman.
The report may infuriate the two sons; the newspaper was delivered to the suspects and was purchased by the gang members.
The second mistake was to not force Valdiz to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper that reported the same story was confiscateed.
Valdiz was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death was of great significance to Mexican violence against journalists.
His spirit persists, and his friends and colleagues believe he has been with us all the time.
In 2003, he was a senior journalist at Noroeste, and this year he co-founded the Riodoce, which sold a $50 share.
"It's impossible not to deal with drug problems in the press," said Pohroqui, in the state of Sinalos.
With the passage of time, the report won a good reputation because of the bold and honest report, sales and advertising also increased.
Journalists prefer to be able to publish research reports directly without worrying about reviewing them. They also like to publish stories that others don't dare to tell.
Riodoce was awarded the news award by the Latin American Mariamos Capo for five years after its founding.
In the same year, the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdiz International Press Freedom Award for his courage to pursue the most authentic Mexican drug reports.
He was afraid of himself.
When the Society of Journalists awarded the award, he said, "I want to continue to live."
Later in October, he said in an interview with the local television station Rompeviento TV, "In the State of Sinalo, drugging is a way of life,
You have to be responsible for the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist - or, rather, be bullied.
I don't want to be asked, 'What have you done in the face of so many deaths?'
All of the staff at Riodace are very sorry for Valdiz, sorry he's like a dock worker, sorry for the friend who's never had the hugs and suggestions, sorry for the teacher who knows how to live.
They depend on their habits.
He used to wear his hat often.
The El Guayabo bar, opposite the office, is always sitting on the same table.
Now they ask, "Is his daily habits causing his treachery?"
His death also allowed them to think about how to work well and live well.
"They don't like you troubling their wives and children, nor do they like you affect their legitimate companies and secret airports used to transport drugs," Pojoque said.
They are beyond their limits."
The result is a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection, even in the most secure time.
Believe in your own intuition.
If you smell a dangerous atmosphere, keep away from it.
"The problem is that the air is a feeling of being fooled... and then something like Haville," said Andres Villaril, editor of Riodace.
He and others said that the previous rules were no longer applicable to Sinaloes - just as they were no longer applicable to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where the smuggling lines of these states profited a lot, and the institutions were small, government officials rotten, and smoked.
The situation is constantly changing.
A few days ago, it was claimed that only spy software sold to the government in Mexico had been used to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen pass under the canopy and avoid the 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) high temperature.
They were sent by the state to protect the office of Riodoce, which is located in a four-story building in the middle-level district of Culiacán.
Some reporters joked that the police did not know that they would belong to the governor's own credit of 50% of the letter.
A few months ago, journalists went to the mountains, where the drugging group was under the control of the actual existence.
This week's episode focuses on three major issues.
Among the great former boxer of Sinalo, Jurio Cesar Chavez, was killed.
The government of the state is also responsible for the provision of funds,
As well as kidnappings in an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, this restaurant is just one block away from the prosecutor's office.
The official did not publish information about the kidnapping object and the kidnapping process, so it is important to be careful when writing down things that the city knows: that is where the restaurant is poisoned and the official loves.
A journalist learned from a public archive that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician, under the ruling party's revolutionary system (PRI), who dominated almost every political class in the last century.
Recently, several Republican governors have been bullied in a number of high-profile cases.
Villaril asked reporters to write about what happened at the place before the incident, including a son of Mexico's No. 1 grand poisonous Suguzman who escaped the military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would look at the Vardiz's column to find the most powerful information about the kidnapping incident.
46-year-old Villarreal, because of the slimness of the figure, called "skinny", said, "Before that, we already knew what had happened.
All of our sources of information are now being disconnected.
Valdiz's office is now used to store signs and stickers of protest killing journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: to represent the active members of the media.
The next morning, reporter Miriam Ramirez took a hand out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to participate in a march related to another reporter.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in West Michigan three days after he was killed in Valdiz.
The body has been found to have been burned and has been tested according to DNA.
Across the country, journalists have become more blunt, and they have organized protests and put on the words "Save the Media" on sidewalks and buildings.
He was not in Washington that day, and he is working hard to uphold justice for the Valdiz case and seek international support.
The next day Valdiz was assassinated, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinalo, Ramirez charged with official spying on reporters and killed them because they had told the facts.
As her anger has influenced her objectiveity, she has also asked for her resignation from reporting on government affairs.
Valdiz has repeatedly reiterated that reporters in Mexico have been organized as criminals, contaminated government officials, and indistinguishable society “around”.
In his previous book, The Drug News, he wrote that journalists were not only killed by drug addicts, but also on the list of politicians and security forces who were contaminated with organized crime.
The media monitor, Articulo 19, committed more than half of the attacks last year against police and public officials.
"In Mexico, they're going to put you to death and shut your mouth," said Ramirez.
Of course, these murders are horrendous.
No one forgets six years ago that blogger Maria Elizabeth Massias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body is a word that is said to have been signed by Zetaskatel: "I came for my report."
Her head was cut down, with a computer keyboard and headphones next to her.
After Miroslava Bridge was killed in March, some newspaper options were shut down, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua.
Others have been killed by the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo in 2014, but they are still alive.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front-page public dialogue on drugs Carter with the title "What do you want to get from us?"
Some journalists have fled their country or even left the country.
This is a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and they still need to be cautious and vigilant on the streets.
Sometimes they will be arrested, according to Ruben Espinossa, who was killed three months after fleeing Veracruz in Mexico City and four women.
This is a daily step of high-risk decision making for those who continue to work behind the scenes.
Ibrahim wanted to be a poet, and he acknowledged that he was afraid of the drug trade.
He said, "Mexico is becoming a prison, so I became a journalist."
In the middle of the last five hours, the latest issue of the newspaper has been printed, and the editors of Riodace sit down and drink beer on the streets outside the office, and suddenly their phone rings.
A series of shootings have occurred in the coastal resort city near Mazatlan, and 19 people have been killed.
The war was also on the rise, as reported by a series of Qatari information found in the region.
They uploaded the news to Riodace's website on their mobile phone.
The first paragraph of the next day has to be changed.
The sound of the sirens sounded nearby - a gun battle in the area where there was a death-dealing battle.
Boholquid looked at the police station there to see if they were alerted.
If they are afraid of something, they do not show it.
The founder of the newspaper has been killed, in his large portraits, pointing to where the entire State of Sinalo needs to look, and Riodace's entire staff follows him at his pace.
“How can you even want to shut down? On the same day Haville was killed, the interns asked me to send her to the street to participate in the report,” Pohque said.
China Self-Driving Tour 2020 Market Size or Breakthrough Billions of yuan
[Abstract] In the context of consumer upgrading and free-flowing, self-driving is encouraged by the national policy and the increasing popularity of consumers.
But at the same time, it is expected that the multi-billion-million-sized self-guided tour market will also face double challenges.
In the context of consumer upgrading and free-flowing, self-guided tours are encouraged by national policies and are loved by more and more consumers.
But at the same time, it is expected to break through the billion-scale self-driving market, but also facing double challenges, on the one hand, self-driving industry development and market demand is not proportional, self-driving clubs and travel agencies and other self-driving organizations facing a low profit dilemma; on the other hand, self-driving infrastructure and services are also in the primary stage.
60% of the total number of domestic tourists, the market size is expected to break billions
In 2016, 44.4 million domestic tourism, self-driving accounted for about 60% of the total number of domestic tourism, and by 2020, the size of the self-driving market is expected to reach more than 100 million.
According to the statistics of the number of self-driving cars in China, the number of self-driving cars in the past five years has continued to grow, and the number of tourists in China is more than half stable.
At the same time, the regional and national levels have shown more attention and support in this emerging field of self-driving, and from 2016 to 2017, the policies and regulations related to self-driving cars, home vehicles and camping tourism have been put out.
In July 2017, the National Tourism Bureau, the National Sports Administration and other eight departments jointly issued the "automobile self-driving camp development plan"; the same month, the reform commission, the Ministry of Finance and other 14 departments jointly issued the "promoting rural tourism development improvement measures (2017), self-guided tour was highlighted.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for domestic self-guided tourism development.
Self-driving club profit is low, the complete industry chain is the key
Although the domestic self-guided tour market has huge potential, the national policy is actively guided, but the self-guided tour industry is still in the primary stage.
According to the 2016-2017 China self-guided tour annual development report, the domestic self-guided tour club, car club, car club, etc. reached thousands, but the proportion of tourists self-guided tour accounted for most, participation in the car club, self-guided tour club and other types of institutions of tourists accounted for only about 15%.
At the same time, independent research and development of self-driving products of online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies are also a number of rankings, many online tourism platforms sold only some providers to provide self-driving products, some self-driving club is also an important supplier.
From the organization of self-driving activities, covering "eat, stay, travel, travel, shopping, recreation" in many aspects, fragmentation is high, upstream supply chain weight, tourists consumption randomly large.
Li Guanjie, the founder and CEO of Beijing Xingtian Automobile Club, believes that self-driving club and travel agency are essentially similar, the early main profit model are based on offline activities, the core point is self-driving line products and leadership services.
However, the self-driving club is facing the need for a new transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving itself is not an independent industry, but with its self-driving displacement characteristics formed a cross-regional, industry ecosystem, forming a complete industrial chain is very important.
In addition to the basic tourism consumption, experience is more important consumption elements.
Therefore, for the development of self-guided tour industry, the characteristics of experience should be enhanced, the development of "self-guided tour +" theme and the IP of self-guided tour products.
The scenic path is not just a road, but a car camp is not just a place to eat and drink.
In the face of self-driving uprisings, the basis of self-driving development is also relatively preliminary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the scenic path is not just a road, but the elements of transportation and tourism are integrated inside, but the road construction and tourism itself are two departments responsible for the transportation sector to add tourism elements, but also stay in the construction of toilets, consulting centers, advertising boards and other facilities, and the integration of tourism is not high.
Compared to the well-known self-driving route "U.S. 66 Road", construction experience is worth learning.
The scenic road design is no longer the most direct and rapid path between the origin to the destination, but to follow the "experience driving pleasure" design concept, for self-driving tourists to enjoy the best enjoyment along the road; the scenic road can be combined with the scenic landscape, both preserving the historical value and cultural value of ecological tourism resources along the way, can also hold a variety of theme activities to enhance tourists' participation and leisure experience, for the local tourism industry to create economic benefits.
In addition to the scenic path, campsite is also an important supporting facility for self-guided tours.
However, among the self-driving tourists, few people choose to stay at the campsite.
They believe that many camps prefer infrastructure, can only meet the requirements of eating, file not high, product single, can not meet the requirements of self-driving such a large number of elements.
Some do not want to reveal the name of the industry insiders said that many companies in the previous years to do camps in order to take the land, after the land, the future supporting infrastructure construction and services have not kept up, the operating status is a lot of losses, and there is no later funding injection, it is difficult to do some corresponding supporting products.
Consumer Group
According to the data released by the China Tourism Ship Association in 2017, from the age of 21-40 years, self-guided groups concentrated, especially 31-40 years old, this part of the population has a certain economic base, and the demand for personalized tourism is higher, and more for parent-child customers.
Check-in from the property, self-guided groups are more likely to prefer non-standard accommodation.
From the perspective of self-driving type, around self-driving is the main type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32%.
Self-care is a lot of people's journey, but it's also smaller.
At the same time, with the improvement of consumer demand, visitors who like to self-driving "visit spots" in the past began to change the concept, is no longer the self-driving process of "get down to take a picture, get on the car sleep", but more concerned about the experience and process of travel.
The dinosaur uses a disguise to hide from the enemy.
At first glance, it was terrible, but it looked like a statue.
The researchers published their first research on rhino-like, incredible biofossil found by Canadian miners, pointing out that the fossil is well preserved, so the experts call it "Mona Lisa" in the dinosaur.
This respecting fossil is very well preserved and can even determine the color of its tanned skin to be red-brown. This indicates that it has some "feelings of distress".
The relevant reports in the Journal of Modern Biology describe it as "one of the best dinosaurs of preservation ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a new discoveries of the cascade, which lives in the medium term from 1.1 billion to 1.1 billion years ago.
Its preservation is extremely complete and shocking to researchers who describe it as "it's really embarrassing."
According to the National Geographic Journal, this type of grass-pepper dinosaur fossil is the best preserved dinosaur fossil ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil when mining a millennium mine near Sencol, near McMuriburg, Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he met something that seemed not so much like the surrounding rock, so he decided to look carefully.
The fossils he found were transferred to the Royal Tyrrhenian Museum in Canada.
Researchers spend 6 years to expose this beast to the inside of a 2500 lb (1100 kg) block.
After such hard work, the final result is now available.
"If you look closely, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrhenian Museum and first author of the book.
"It will become one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
By studying its skin, researchers found that this herb life, although covered with armor, was like a walking tank, could be a major threat to the dinosaurs from eating.
This dinosaur uses red-white placards to evade predators, and uses hidden techniques known as "anti-mask", which are also used by many modern animals.
The experts said that in this way, it can be better integrated with the surrounding environment, thereby avoiding the enemy, which indicates that it is being hunted by a larger dinosaur.
The 1.1 billion-year-old creature belongs to the Quanlong family, which first became headline news in May and is currently being exhibited at the Royal Tyrrhenian Bio Museum.
As one of the team members of the museum technologist Mark Mitchell spent 7000 hours uncovering the beast's face, the researchers now researched it and named it "Borealopelta markmittelli."
The sample is very well preserved, so that Dr. Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists can record the drawings and shapes of the plate and nails on his body.
They discovered the "anti-mask" technique, which is a common defense in the animal world, which means that the back of the species is darker than the color on its side.
Although the "anti-blocking" technique is very common, the findings are surprising because the dinosaur's body shape is far more than the existing animals that use anti-blocking technique.
This dinosaur faces the pressure of being killed by the meat dinosaur, and thus evolves in the direction of advantage, so that it can hide in the face as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing animals that use antibodies, such as deer, zebra, or slinging, are as small and fragile as hunter, which indicates that the creature is facing real survival pressure.
"The massive heavy metal dinosaur suffers from crazy predatory eating shows how dangerous the white-crowned meat dinosaur is," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its tanning also shows that the dinosaur's skin color is red-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the lifeline of the organism, including the gastrointestinal content it retains to find the final food.
They believed that the dinosaur was smashed into the river at the time of death, and was then smashed into the sea, and finally submerged in the sea in a way that was lowered.
At that time, the climate of Alberta was as warm as today's southern Florida's climate, and the rivers and oceans could be deeper than they are now.
Brown said: "This bunny is truly amazing because it is completely covered by the cylindrical skin it has saved, and so far it has been kept in the dimensional space so that its original shape can be preserved," he said.
"So the current shape of the species is almost the same as that of the white man.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping."
The white denim period is the period when two feet are walking a large dinosaur dinosaurs roaming on the earth.
Despite being the king of the dinosaurs, it only appeared millions of years after the dinosaur. The dinosaur may have been killed by some of the ancestor of the dinosaurs.
They include a thorny horn, a beast weighing up to 6 tons and 38 feet (11.5 meters).
The latest research found that scientists appearing in the Journal of Modern Biology believed that after the end of the dragon died to the sea, and then formed Mummy in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Fink discovered the biome at a millennium mine near McMurrayburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved cape dinosaur, from the nose to the areas of the hip, the skin and armor are all complete.
The average length of this organism is about 18 feet (5 meters), weighing 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20-inch long, sharp corners that emerge from the shoulder.
The researchers believe that the pyramid dinosaur was active in the western region of Canada, and was later flooded by rivers that erupted into the sea.
However, this type of dinosaur burying under the sea makes its cape fully preserved.
The remains of the fossil remains of this special sample are very well preserved so that the leftover skin still covers the uneven parts of the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, it is very rare to have such a degree of preservation, just as it is in China.
The more I see it, the more I think it's incredible.
Leftover skin fossils are still covered by armor that spot on the dinosaur bone.
Its right-hand palm is on its side and five toes are raised.
I can count on it."

The total number of security guards at the 2012 London Olympics is more than double the number of security guards at the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security interconnection program ever.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 85 million people from the military and police would work together, including 20,000 troops and 650,000 police officers.
The majority of the military will be responsible for defending the Olympic Stadium, while the 3000 additional officers will be responsible for the security of international airports, metro stations and streets.
Police patrols other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6000 troops have arrived in Rio as an Olympic Security Service.
They are also responsible for patrolling at the airport as well as on the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic Stadium.
The introduction of evaluation mechanism in the service industry is not new things, in order to make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make the supervision more effective, not in the form of.
How radicalists learned to answer the question, "Who's the street?"
On August 9, 2014, the heart of Brittany Ferrer was troubled.
On the first day of a trip to New York City, the St. Louis man was sitting in a bed in love and browsing Facebook on his phone.
She accidentally found a post from a high school student.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and the child was lying on the street."
She found that no one else posted this message on the feed, and she was confused. She tweeted about Facebook and opened it.
A @TheePharaoh user is constantly pushing her dynamics.
The St. Louis area said that singer-songwriter live on tweeted about Michael Brown's death. Michael Brown was a 18-year-old black who had not carried a weapon and was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He took a picture of a Brown body that lost his life symbol lying on the street, and his body lay on the street for four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrer thought.
Death is nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped her phone and opened Twitter again that night, reading the tweets about the crowd gathered on Canfield Avenue.
There are police videos and photos of people yelling, and there is a photo of a man who claims to be Brown's father, which says, "The Ferguson police have just killed my son!"
She saw a live broadcast that a police officer used to stand in front of a group of protesters with a bang.
In another video, another police officer raised his rifle and screamed: "I'll kill all of you ... livestock."
"That's not normal," Ferrer recalled.
"This is not a common, commonly referred to as a murder case."
At that moment, I felt cold.
I'm crying and I'm crying."
She booked a return flight and returned the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrer and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary, "Who's Street?", which was released in theaters on August 11.
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the people who live in this community, fill the streets and ask for answers.
Ferrer and his daughter (dressed in a skirt, with crowns) were driving to Ferrerson, and they discussed their many topics before that morning - "on the black experience and the black situation."
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their beliefs?" she recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson now, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy.
I had to bring her up," said Ferrer.
"What happens today is the climax of everything that happened in the past.
She was aware of, seen, and raised from the scene.
She not only needs to develop well in radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different aspects of the black experience and the black situation, to understand what we must do to get freedom and liberation.
Even though I had the privilege of providing her with racism that she had not experienced personally, she was no different from other black girls.
"If I protect her in this matter, I feel that I am hurting her."
They arrived at Fergusson's first stop on the opposite side of the police station in South Florida. The place became their camp after the radicals waited until the police officer Darren Wilson finally did not prosecute.
Ferrer and her daughter are in contact with a local business owner who makes a bag-packed lunch.
They are responsible for sending the bags to protesters.
In the beginning, Ferrer began to form a new type of activism.
"My radicalism changed completely after August 9," she said. When she attended the undergraduate program at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, she was Chairman of the Association of Ethnic Minorities Nurses and Students, concerned about the food justice and health gap in the Black community.
"I have no organizational experience.
This is how it all came about."
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film director Sabah Flair in a night tour.
Fletcher says she and her film director Lucas Alvarado Fletcher "Just want to record what happened."
A question appeared in the sea of Ferrer: "Do you want to record or want to find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many such cases: people - usually white - enter a community to gain benefits from their pain and hard work.
As Frédéric explained in a recent interview, "We have heard that people born and raised in Ferguson do not concentrate on their voice, and we want to do it differently."
FLOYEN is already in contact with co-directed director Damon Davis. Damon Davis is a regional artist known for radicalism against the detainees.
His involvement led Ferrer to join the "Who's Street?" project team with six other locals, who have not been able to stay behind for years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or talking to us, it's about us," Davis said.
"I'm mainly concerned about how these people are presented, because that's the way I'm presented."
Even though the goal is not to pay attention to Ferrer's experience - it is to show that the movement is not about the leader of the Savior, but about community cohesion," says Ferrer.
As a result, "Who's the street?" was surprisingly recorded in Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and entering into marriage.
"I felt naked," Ferrer smiled when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there must be some degree of vulnerability to do the job and humanize black people."
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirmed and re-positioned the role of black queer women in the wider black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, after the 2012 Black teenager Trevorn Martin shot, created #BlackLivesMatter on social media, and was identified as Queer.
"Black queer women in leadership overall supported the movement," Ferrer said. "That's because we're constantly fighting on multiple lines."
Black queer women have to bear all of that."
Folice agrees and mentions "This movement is really supported by black women and many black queer women."
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the centerpiece of the film. However, she insisted that "this is not an affirmative action against things."
"She's the one who inspires this kind of energy," she said.
"Although she's at the frontline, it's not a coincidence, because in the life of these crossroads, as a black queer woman, you have a lot to do.
You can feel her energy through the curtain."
At the same time, in Ferguson, news cameras have long disappeared, but the tension between the community and the police still exists.
Ferrer was suspended for more than two and a half years due to the attempt to lock the highway during a tour.
She describes the social and political atmosphere of the area she calls home: "a mess."
Despite this, she has been following the hymn of her own efforts since she embarked on the street of Ferguson three years ago.
"We have a duty to fight for freedom.
We have the responsibility to win.
We need to support each other.
We can't be lost, except for the lock on the body."
In fact, the online translation service was already provided on the web ten years ago, and in fact, a long time ago, the discussion about "machines are about to replace human translation" is not always overheard.
Similarities: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are several faces in the center of the Fridman Museum of Art in New York: white, black, and brown, with almost unmistakable similarities between each face, which are lined up by a line that falls from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Hagborg using Chelsea? Mannings to send her face cotton swabs and hairbrush.
Manning sent out his head debris from the Prison of Livingworth, and the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking confidential diplomatic telegraphs through the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition opened on August 2, with the title "Similar Place."
This was the result of two years of communication between Duvet Hagburg and Manning, and Duvet Hagburg combined its discipline with its own in technology, computer science and art, while Manning was a well-known politician who had been jailed and had undergone sexual surgery in prison. Former U.S. President Obama pardoned her remaining penalties three days before the end of his term.
By doing algorithmic analysis from Manning's DNA, he created 30 portraits of "most likely appearances". Hesse Douwe Hubog made a slightly excruciating and slightly unmerciful comment on this. His comment was both intentional about DNA and the concept of identity itself.
Manning was born under the name Bradley Edward, who publicly acknowledged himself as a woman in adolescence. He was convicted in 2013 on 20 allegations, including 6 spies, computer fraud and theft.
In the prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a black and white selfie with a particle feeling, and it seemed obvious troubling, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a golden wig.
In 2015, Heather Duway Hubbard achieved great success in her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In the work, she uses a medium court object from cigarettes and chewing gums, DNA extracted from debris, to create a portrait of a 3D character that may be similar to a long-acting one.
She received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They wanted to interview Chelsea Manning in prison, and they needed a portrait," said Hasselblad at the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
At that time, Chelsea Manning was unable to visit or take photos, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So, the artist and her imprisoned sis became impossible friends and exchanged many letters with each other for two years.
They even created a comic book, The Suppressed Portrait, written by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book predicts that the president will be able to grant privileges to Manning in the future, and she will be able to see the exhibition in jail.
Obama asked her to be released a few days after the book was published. This could be a coincidence, when Manning was in Kansas' military prison for the seventh year.
In addition, the exhibition also has another dimension of deep concern. Because the modern United States, the Trump administration is constantly declaring war on government secrets and transgender soldiers, while finding new ways to scramble on Twitter to incite the divisive, and the exhibition is exactly to commune with such divisiveness.
When asked about all these special moments, Heather Duway Hubbard said, "There is a reason for anything to happen."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature is shown below (named "i" in the picture with a heart), calling for an end to the "controversial image of the party based on gender, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side of the wall is her particle DNA sequence, which uses a pen twist to distort the Cs, Gs, and As symbols.
Through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide, complex scientific dictionary for every artist), Heather Duway Hubbard wanted to express at least physiologically, by describing these strangely similar portraits.
"I hope people get out of this dilemma, and our genomes don't care who we are, how publicly available genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Heather Dowell Hubbard, whose 2007 video work "Fake Memories" is also on display.
"The DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so here are 30 of them."
The last piece of the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in a novel in the previous illustration.
Demonstrated the manning of the U.S. soldiers under the amp, the golden shape of Manin.
"When they stop your speech, they win," he wrote on the wall.
"So, millions shut their mouths."
'The content comes directly from her letter to me,' said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm scared, I'm still going to say it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition, as predicted in the comics, but when she does, she will be greeted by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters in the center of the exhibition.
It was also purposeful, just as all the objects in the exhibition, reached the height of the genetic monopoly information she wrote with a pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
'In the past, I held them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group of people,' he said when he spoke about portraits.
"But I want to make them feel like a group of protesters with Chelsea, just as they wanted to release her at that time."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee were arrested for murder
Police said a man was found dead in a Chicago luxury apartment, and a Northwest University professor and an Oxford employee were subsequently stabbed to death and are currently searching for suspects nationwide.
The Cook County Court records that Windem Lessem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, have been issued a first-class, unsolved murder warrant on suspicion of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranlow's death.
According to the records, 26-year-old Cornell Duran Loin died of multiple stab wounds.
The Chicago Police Department issued a community warning that the body was discovered on July 27.
Police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment when they received a phone call and found a number of injuries.
Police say Cornell Duranlo was dead, and investigators are investigating the murder and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lesem has been an Associate Professor in Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cobbage, Deputy Director of Campus Relations, said in an email statement that Lésem is now retired and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
“It is now a criminal case, which is being investigated by the authorities, and the Northwest University is actively cooperating with the investigation,” said Cobec.
Warren is a Senior Financial Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the Summerville College at the University of Oxford said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in constant contact with the British police and are ready to assist the U.S. investigation agency as needed."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply alarmed and hoped that he would be able to commit himself.
The Chicago Police Department's Chief Liaison Officer, Anthony Gulermey, said he strongly encouraged the suspect to self-initiate with the authorities.
"The police already have an overview of their whereabouts and we are working to locate the possible locations," Gulermi said.
The local, regional and national authorities are making every effort to help search suspects.
The police received a phone call from Grand Plaza Apartment Manager, who just received a secret reminder that there was something wrong with Apartment 1008.
The police said the situation was terrible.
At this time, it is still unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
According to the security camera, it was confirmed that Lesem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe that Professor Lestem has a relationship with the victim," Guellermi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents: "The police are currently investigating the victim's timing and background, and are investigating various motives, including possible domestic incidents together."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutco said, "We will complete the roadmap for the World Anti-Doping Agency in the near future."
Vitali Mutco, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, said the remaining standards to implement the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will not take too long to reinstate the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"The implementation of the roadmap standard has been carried out at a certain stage, and RUSADA has the right to cooperate with the UKAD for planning and testing.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," Mutco said Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister Mutco made the above statement in commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Organization Roadmap, Compliance. This section sets out the criteria for restoring the rights of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the organization.
The standard does not contain anything that may cause concern in Russia, according to Mütco.
He added, "Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must openly accept the results of a survey conducted by Canadian lawyer Richard Michaelan on the WADA approved by the Russian state to support the use of anti-Doping events in its own sport.
Speaking of this, Mutco said, "We are investigating that our anti-inflammatory system has failed without a doubt.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not recognize what does not exist."
Mutco's response to the words of Vitali Smirnov, the head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in the past when he was interviewed earlier that day, but he added: "We have repeatedly said in various occasions that the report contains controversial stances and regulations.
No one is planning to accept the report unconditionally," Smirnov said.
In November 2015, WADA suspended the right to carry out an initiator test in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
On his visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, Olivia Naegry, WADA's general director, said RUSADA is "advancing in the right direction" and is working to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's checkers or national chess, defeating humanity was no longer a word decades ago.
In an interview with the Croatian President Davao-Souk, he said the participation in the China Cup is important for Croatian football, and the Chinese Cup has a very large number of awards.

Further reduction in tariffs on consumer goods

U.S. Department of Commerce: U.S. Department of Commerce should be careful when making changes
China's new network on December 29
According to the U.S. Daily News, Christmas is just around the corner, and the return tide is approaching.
According to ABC, more than half of the items sold last year were returned.
In addition, the reader has been hacked several times, and consumers need to pay more attention when shopping on the unofficial website.
In general, large shopping companies have regular, reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts from some small shops or e-commerce shopping, you must be careful.
Rolando's Lady Hou's local time on December 1st in a special printing jacket shop, spent more than 60 (USD, the same) to buy a coat, the result has not yet been shipped.
She sent an email to the customer service and didn't see a reply.
There was also a network explosion, last year we went to the United States to travel, to buy a mobile phone to third-party sellers, and then found that there was a box of rubber.
After knowing that you have been cheated, apply for a refund to the website, and you will also receive a full refund.
However, the customer also believes that the website's refund service is not 100% perfect.
A Northern California resident, Mr. Wang, said that he had purchased an expedited delivery service for a site twice, and had an expedited service of $400, but did not deliver it on time.
There is no refund or reply.
There is a better return policy for large shopping malls and shopping malls.
Most Macy's products are fully refunded within 180 days.
However, the goods must be kept as "original" and have to purchase credentials such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no certification, customers can also get shopping points, which can be used to purchase other items.
Target has a 90-day return period for general goods and 15-day return period for electronic products.
However, the return period for electronic and recreational goods purchased from November 1 to December 25, 2017 is extended to 30 days.
It is important to note that the 30-day money-back period begins on December 25th, which is to return before January 25th, 2018.
A new era of shopping and shopping is coming.
More than a decade ago, China's overall market is also in the seller's market, people's choice is limited, and demand is limited.
But after ten years of development, the market has long achieved from the seller's market to the buyer's market, today's consumer taste has become more dull, they are no longer satisfied with the simple "first-hand money first hand delivery" shopping behavior.
Therefore, how to get a great shopping experience for consumers has become the next competitive point for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the shopping experience of consumers, shopping centers in the business district have the most significant impact.
See how urban builders around the world focus on shopping experiences.
There are no two exactly the same leaves in the world, and there are no two exactly the same shopping malls. A famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's famous Kanyon shopping center, its unique wavy-shaped architectural design inspired by the Canyon, so the name of the rumor Kanyon, walks 200 meters in the middle of Kanyon, feels like being in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the valley-style design, there is also a large, intangible oval-shaped venue in the center of the shopping center, which is unique in appearance, and often holds special performances.
Because of the open platform design, tourists can walk on each level to see the activities in the "Tangu", and have the effect of shifting the scenery.
In China, the first forest-style walk in China, known as the Nanjing Forest More Commercial Street, will be the perfect combination of shopping with ecology and fairy tale.
7000 square meters of green space, 3000 square meters of roof water platform, the project consists of 9 units of buildings, the air corridor between the buildings connected, the overall subsidized courtyard design, the ground-riding French tung tree as the construction surface, roof water roof roof roof, to create a forest-like feeling.
Into the forest Moore, like a careless fall into the rabbit hole of Alice's comic and amusement, climbing the trunks of the trees will be built around, the grassland, the clear water reflects, bringing people into the vivid and dynamic forest.
There are also in Chongqing, the building of Lijiabin water business district, planning Baifang business, planning to introduce more than 50 international top-level flagship stores in the future, more than 100 international top-level brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign well-known brands, to create a service industry gathering, the theme of bright business center.
Not only that, Lijia Waterfront also integrates ecology into the building, with TOD public transport as the guide, collects fashion shopping, lifestyle services, dining, entertainment, education, sports in one, while bringing consumers to the ultimate shopping experience while also leading them to enjoy the unique "margin culture", will shopping and water entertainment, leisure perfect integration.
In summary, it can be found that at present, some of the housing companies have insight into the discovery of this new urban business, and industry insiders said that this consumer experience as the center, how to combine shopping and experience consumption model will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
Today's business district is not only a commodity concentration, but also an integrated place integrating art and culture, creative themes, and also bear the responsibility of people for urban living.
Therefore, in order to meet the needs of consumers to eat and play, at the same time, to maximize the multi-level spirit of the transmission of cultural and artistic needs, to play the livable living needs, must be the high point of the future development of the business district.
In Chongqing, the north bank of Jiangshan, located in Jiangbei, close to the sound bridge, the world's commercial excellence, the international giants around the circle, the first brand gathering, with the international fashion close to the connection.
The world is full of beauty and beauty;
With a better shopping environment, Dongyuan is close to Nanping business district, and enjoys the western and even nationally leading four-level stereoscopic transportation system, which enhances shopping comfort.
In addition, Huigong Road and Wanda Square two pedestrian streets of the garden greening, landscape pavilion was upgraded, planting about 300 trees, transformation of the pavilion 40,000 square meters, enhance Nanping business district image;
Longhu Lake, near Chongqing's first low-density riverside business district, surrounded by nine parks, low-density commercial streets, high degree of openness, so that people are more willing to stay, lean, slowly enjoy the shopping fun, rather than being rushed by the people behind, really achieved "walk shopping".
Today's commercial competition will only become more and more fierce, how to kill a bloody road in the market of homogeneousization, to seize the reputation of "shopping holy land" in the hearts of future consumers, worthy of all real estate developers to seriously think about.
Single because of the differentiation strategy is far enough is not enough, only those who really put consumers in the heart, the urgency of consumers, want consumers to think, to provide consumers with the ultimate and simple shopping experience developers in the storm to come in the market to laugh proud of the lake.
Of course, by the end of the day I would be most happy or celebrating people, with such a good shopping experience and a business district, no one could imagine today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Chapter 1: Consumerism Covers the Real Environmental Costs
1682 million yuan, this is the turnover of Tmall users in the 24 hours of the "Tiantian XI Global Comedy Festival" on November 11, 2017.

These consumptions will bring up to 8.12 million logistics orders.
Whether it is the online shopping platform or the payment platform, all belong to the Mayun Ali group.
Ten years ago, no one would think that November 11 alone young people created by self-deception of the "nostalgia" subculture will be compiled by electricians, becoming the present phenomenon level of the "double 11" shopping fun festival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba was the first time to use the marketing gimmick of "single-handed day big promotion": no one to talk to you about love, then "single-handed dogs" to buy online.
As a result, the transaction amount of Taobao Mall (the "previous") exceeded $52 million, which was 10 times the daily transaction amount at the time.
Since then, "double 11" has become Alibaba's shopping fun festival, from the beginning of domestic buyers and sellers enjoyed themselves, to now the surge of global merchants, nine years ago, Tmall "double 11" billion transactions has been more than 3200 times this year, making the "black Friday" look at the crowd.
With the promotion of "double eleven", there are also many electricians, among them, "kyoto" is the most powerful.
"Kyoto" has its own shopping section, "6.18", but there is no "double 11" impact big, this year from November 1 to 11, the cumulative sales of "Kyoto" reached $1271 million.
And after "double 11", immediately followed by a similar "double 12" discount joy, Christmas New Year shopping period.
Over the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers to have a pre-Spring Festival procurement period, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, will not be on holiday.
The environmental problems caused by the rapid consumption of large amounts of water have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily Telegraph reports, according to the industry's regular packaging 0.2 kilograms of conservative estimates, this year's "double 11" period generated at least more than 30 million tons of garbage.
Liu Hua, director of the Greenpeace East Asia Division, told China and foreign dialogue, this year's "double 11" only Tianqi's order volume will produce 160,000 tons of packaging waste.
In 2016, the National Postal Service issued a report indicating that during the period of "double 11" in 2015 (11th to 16th November) the number of fast items about 7.8 billion pieces, the use of more than 3 billion weaving bags, 99.22 million packaging boxes, 169.8 million m tape, tape length can be traversed the Earth Equator 425 laps.
And this year, the national post office is projected to "double 11" the number of express business is expected to exceed 15 billion pieces.

What kind of mobile payments do the Germans want?
WINTER: Mobile payment wars in Germany are not expected.
WeChat Pay and Pay, but the battle field has moved to Europe, the competition has not changed, the robbery has not changed - Chinese people, this is globalization?
Where there is a treasure, there must be a micro-payment.
In accordance with the agreement with German electronic payment service provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially entered into Germany in November this year, and gradually in Europe in the business layout.
The 'old country' reunite takes place in Europe.
Since then, WeChat Pay has been on the road to globalization.
For the globalization of mobile payments in China, Ai Rui consults on "China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017" summarizes two types: First, through strategic investment, experience output, equity and support foreign mobile payment enterprises.
Second, through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists out of China, to promote mobile payment services to foreign merchants, and thus change the recognition and acceptance of foreign domestic mobile payment in China.
In fact, the Chinese are in the sky.
China's rapid economic development, coupled with a large population base, Chinese tourists in Europe spending is a fascinating number.
However, it is also clear that the China Mobile Payment Warfare, which was opened in Germany, was not expected.
The WeChat Pay and Pay treasure have just moved the battlefield to Europe, the competition has not changed, the robbery has not changed - or the Chinese, is this a globalization?
Is it possible for China's mobile payments to expand in Europe?
For example, Germany.
The magic of "new retail"
Chen Chen, Chen Kaihan: Amazon announced in the world's top ten retailers to enter the military bookstores and grocery stores, regardless of the timing or motivation is well worth the fun.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two booksstores in Portland and Santiago.
In 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York and plans to have at least 8 stores by the end of the year.
Almost the same time, Amazon announced the operation of Amazon Go, customers do not need to queue at the store, do not need to settle, enter the code, take the goods to leave, the purchase amount will automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
In the past few years, it has been a rare occurrence for Amazon to move frequently in physical stores.
In the 2007 Open Letter to Shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized that Amazon will not easily open a physical store, unless the following four conditions are met:
We need to be sure that this new opportunity will allow shareholders to make a return on their investment;
We need to make sure that this new opportunity is of great importance to the entire company.
We must be sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market.
We need to be sure that in this market, we have enough resources to make customer-facing differences.
Bookstores and groceries are the most rocking categories of two physical retails, and also the first to fall after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon announced that it would enter the two physical markets at the time of the convergence of the world's top 10 retailers, both of which are fun to play with, whether on time or motive.
Is Amazon's practice in breach of the guarantee of shareholders' letters?
The other side of the earth also heard a similar sound. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunba Conference, Chairman of the Alibaba Board of Directors, Mr. Ma Yun delivered a keynote speech.
"From next year onwards, Alibaba will no longer refer to e-commerce," he said.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon come to an end, and in the next decade or twenty years, there will be no e-commerce, instead of the 'new retail'.
Online and offline logistics are combined to generate new retail."
At one time, "new retail" three words like being cast magic, by the industry people often hang on the mouth.
But what does "new retail" mean?
If it's just a combination of lines and lines, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer traced the estimated gross sales of 180 largest e-commerce companies of about US $20 billion, while the largest 25 accounted for more than US$1590 billion.
Of the 25, 18 were traditional retailers that started their business online in the last five years (e.g., Messi, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And Alibaba Group 283 million yuan into the shares of Suning Yun Merchant, also experienced in the eyes.
From a global perspective, retailers and e-commerce are shifting from a single channel to a omni-channel retail system that covers physical stores, e-commerce, mobile terminals, and social media.
Is Ma Yun refers to the "new retail", more is a summary rather than a future outlook?
If not, what is the difference between the concept of omnichannel and the concept of "new retail"?
Perhaps the key issue is not the combination of online and offline, but how to integrate.
Looking back at the past 20 years in the retail industry, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of early-year discount retailers, are all focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, the e-commerce company put a very high degree of standardization of products, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the cultivation of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of the customer experience, e-commerce companies have reached other categories and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO, "Use the Internet's ideas and technology to comprehensive reform and upgrade the total number of existing 300 million social retailers, so that the increasing consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, making the whole product production, circulation, service process because of the widespread use of the Internet, big data becomes more efficient."
Therefore, the road of e-commerce is a surface light asset, the road of actual heavy asset.
"light", refers to fixed assets, personnel allocation, management processes and other burdens do not have traditional retail industry; "weight", refers to the need for huge investment in logistics, storage and other aspects.
The change in the logistics mode ensures the efficiency of the electricity supplier.

On January 18, Alibaba held a summit conference on e-commerce poverty, announced that by exploring the new model of "Internet + poverty", to help improve poverty and rural revitalization.
This is followed by proposing rural strategies, launching rural Taobao projects, on-line poverty alleviation platform, and establishing Alibaba Poverty Fund, Ali once again "plus" on the strong fight against poverty.
Poverty alleviation is one of China's most important national strategies.
Total poverty has not been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"E-commerce poverty alleviation is an innovative initiative of a new round of poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation.
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that the Internet can play a key role in helping to promote poverty alleviation and eradicate poverty, so that agricultural products out of rural areas through the Internet."
Therefore, in 2014, Ali proposed a rural strategy with big data cloud computing and globalization and listed as the three major core strategies of Ali in the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched a rural Taobao (village Taobao) project to recruit "village 2" in rural areas, leading farmers to get rich through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali cooperated with the business sector to build a poverty alleviation channel, and is currently accumulating to 13 provinces and 120 national poverty-stricken counties.
There are 2118 Taobao Villages born of Ali platform.
Of them, nearly 400 appeared in the poorest counties in the province, 33 appeared in the poorest counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, the sales of Taobao Village in Alibaba China reached $11.2 billion.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of the strong national strategy of poverty alleviation, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali economy, in order to get out of poverty out of a new way.
Among them, Village Tao is the main support platform for Ali's electricity companies to get rid of poverty, and through a direct sale of the Internet to get rid of poverty new link.
In the planting section, village Tao and turret uniforms to jointly carry out agricultural tools and small loans support.
In 2017, in the 832 national-level poor counties, the golden service has served 795, which provides convenient payment, credit and other services.
In order to solve the storage and logistics, Tmall is responsible for sales, Alibaba Cloud's big data back-feeding guide agricultural production, and further improve the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce is not only about product, sales channel, industry planning, but also about talent.
Ali started an electricity supplier course at Taobao University to teach farmers standardized, quality and scaled cultivation methods, and achieved the combination of " poverty alleviation + mental support", so that farmers can sustain poverty alleviation.
These courses cover about 92% of the country's poorest counties.
And the "philanthropy mindset, business means" of poverty alleviation ideas, but also to ensure that Ali in the era of poverty alleviation to achieve "true poverty alleviation."
The chairman of the Alibaba Board of Directors, Ma Yun, said that the eradication of poverty should be divided into three stages: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and wealth alleviation.
Poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, wealth is to give farmers a "fish pond", so that the farmers can have fish.
The industry driven by e-commerce is the making of fish ponds.
In the poverty alleviation industry, Ali and Shaanxi Luochuan jointly created the Luochuan apple industry poverty alleviation model, has been used as an example by the relevant departments in the national reproducibility promotion.
Ali Electric's poverty alleviation efforts have also been recognized by the decision-makers.
Alibaba's representative e-commerce enterprises have been sent a message, through the online offline channels, to ensure farmers' increase in production.
Some village primary and secondary care workers were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of e-commerce in poverty.
At present, the Chinese office of the United Nations World Food Programme (UNFPA) has been working together with villagers to develop the e-commerce industry in Anhui and other places.
Sina Financial News The "Third New Economic Think Tank Conference" jointly organized by Alibaba Research Institute and China's far-reaching Zhikutan was held on January 16th, and Zhangli, the director of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry Research Institute, attended and spoke.
She believes that the most important issue we ignore is the globalization of the body and the use of it, and the globalization of it.
Many people think that globalization has stopped, and many developed countries and developing Chinese countries, in the new stage of their attitude to globalization is different, is the model is different.
The second concept is the issue of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
The economic and environmental constraints are due to the changing globalization of the economic basis.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment will basically end at the end of 2017, will enter a new round of growth period after 2018, and the next round of growth must be the product pull.
Beijing's first fresh supermarket 7FRESH recently officially opened, plans to set up more than 1000 stores in the country in the next three to five years.
With Ali's box fresh, bright super variety, Suning's fresh, the palm fish fresh, etc., the "new retail store" began to pile up, and even in the innovation model and even the price of each other's "call board".
The rise of fresh supermarkets, has become a phenomenon in the new retail field, where is the new retail?
"In 2018, we will quickly enter the country, before the Spring Festival in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou will open a large number of stores."
On the 10th of the second New Retail Summit 2018, Hu Yi, CEO of Box Fangsheng, revealed the "new ways to play" in 2018.
"Since 2018, box is not just a fresh electricity supplier, but a lifestyle electricity supplier that meets the immediate service of consumers.
The core mode line is the flow, experience, online is the real sales."
Different from the traditional big stores, supermarkets, boxes are born in the eyes of many consumers is a fun and delicious "red shop", and even there are intermediaries to hit the concept of "box room".
Both online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have advantages and disadvantages, but consumers appear in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying the omni-channel mode.
In the industry, it is believed that in the context of the rise in consumption, the 2018 "type box horse" store will be more and more.
From the initial freshness of the box, constantly explored more areas of consumption, indicating that in the new year, the retail market will have more innovation.
"For example, the business model under the online line, which attracts the eyes of consumers, and the fresh supermarkets all over the place are called again."
"But these relationships have been said more and more, there is no use again, and in the end you did not bring a good experience to consumers, I had a good experience before I was willing to buy an order."
In the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed, and the purchase demand has also changed.
Originally pure online, under the line is split, the line to beat the online, the online counter-attack line, is now a player, because consumers no longer have the line under the line difference.
The capital's rivalry, which is now represented by fresh supermarkets, is full of new retail fires.
Analysis believes that the competition of new retail in first-line cities is far from the pattern of the Red Sea, and there are large second-line cities to be mined, the market still has a lot of opportunities and space.
Different types of industries for the layout of new retail will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development.

Help you avoid becoming the next great start-up
Amy Erlet wanted to investigate the happiness of employees in her e-commerce startup, but the investigation didn't work.
The responses are often indistinguishable, useless, and even worse, misleading.
Even though she promised to use an anonymous form, some employees still don't trust the process.
ELITE is responsible for managing the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce escort company Madison Reed, who says "the response lacks consistency and objectivity."
She called for foreign aid.
A group of new human resources start-up companies such as spring after the rain, to help the company understand the feelings of employees.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee engagement so that the company can quickly conduct polls on specific teams and demographics, provide employees with anonymous and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow executives to report directly to the Board.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, said. Glint software analysis tool is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Over the next three years, she has been using Glint to gain more insight into her employees' thoughts and feelings.
In addition to the quick and polls of specific teams, Glint also offers company highlights, which units have the most complaints, which managers have low approval scores, and at a glance – which gives her a deeper understanding of why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must be familiar with the company's workplace culture, so as not to become the next advantage. Ex-priority employees previously published a blog post describing the environment to be disturbed, these spokespersons were punished by the company, and then ex-privileged.
For start-ups like Glint, the company's desire to monitor is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments, by 2020, the value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could be more than $1,187 billion.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, is committed to helping companies prevent and detect bad behaviours, and during the early years of the year, they saw an increase in interest and activity in this area.
Convertent has nearly 600 customers, including Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla.
The contract has recently become a client.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to send customized "diagnosing" surveys, collect confidential responses in real-time, and view hot charts in their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous SMS hotlines for employees to report bad behavior.
If the President is involved, the complaint will be directly entered into the board of directors.
Convercent founder and chief executive Patrick Quinland said: "The judiciary has overtaken the authority of the regulators.
If a company is found to be treated poorly or unethical, even if the regulatory body does not intervene, the company may also face the high consequences of consumer boycotts, employee churn, and intolerance, Quentin said.
Ruby Tuesday is a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees spanning more than 500 locations and has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees understand the working guidelines and working rules and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
Prior to this, if employees want to report the problem, they must find the company's headquarters phone number or email, make a formal complaint, and hope that the headquarters can take it seriously.
This is often a scary and disturbing experience, James Vitrano, a legal advisor to Ruby Tuesday, said he did not think there was a good way to keep track of employee complaints.
But now the company uses Convercent to find and resolve issues that were previously unknown to executives who were far away from the office, city, or state - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay behavior.
“I can get closer and a 360-degree view of the work experience,” says Vitalano, who is responsible for the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment prosecutions."
Quentin said that after the inaugural closure of Andorra CPAs due to a breach of ethical norms, companies have been paying more attention to ethics, values and employee engagement since 2002.
But until social media entered their own world, companies realized that they couldn't stop their explosives from spreading online.
"Before the use of technology to monitor morality, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Converscent provide their software as a service and charge the company a recurring fee for the use of the product.
This business model and business opportunity are supported by risk investors who have already provided support to these two start-up companies.
In February, a total capital increase of $47 million was raised from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital.
In November, Glint received US$10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, with total funds of US$6 million.
Given the interrelationship between companies, culture, and risk investments, these investments will hardly surprise anyone.
More and more research shows that today's workforce has higher expectations for the workplace than ever before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high pay and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to join the company, to feel their voices are heard, and the work they do is beneficial, they will be more committed to making the company successful,” said Nina Macartney, vice president of global welfare and employee experience at LinkedIn.
Investors in their portfolio companies perform well in return; the company performs well in employee loyalty and professionalism.
If a third-party analytics tool promises to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it is no surprise that they are looking for financial support.
Cultural experts at the workplace say it's important to know employee engagement data.
However, these data are useless unless the company's administrator takes action.
In fact, if a company requires feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company will be making changes.
If the progress of change is not fast enough, or there is no progress, it can lead to disappointment and lead to employees leaving the company.
"If you want to seek 4000 recommendations, then you need to be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Rath, Head of Consulting, Commercial Management Cotter International, Inc.
"Because if you don't follow up, the staff will think, 'Did you really hear what I said?'
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care?'
According to Erate, Madison Reed is now conducting monthly employee surveys and is now able to take action on the same day that Glint reports the issue.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustrations due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday companies are gaining new insights on their employees, and in the long run, they want to be able to make changes in the industry known for their high talent turnover and better retain their employees.
"If you're not committed to creating a transparent culture, you lose talent," says Vitrano.
"If you lose your talent, you will lose your customers.
And when you lose your customers, you lose your company."

NCAA cancels the training twice a day to extend the training time of the bear team
At 11 p.m., the University of California, Los Angeles football team members hovered around the team's new campus practice ground.
Some players have taken off their jerseys, revealing the first day of the camp trying to train the sweaty back of the body.
For a large part of the team, this free time is a few minutes of rest.
Players participating in the summer course will return to the final exam in the dormitory after three hours of practice, and then the next morning at 6:30am will return to the Wasserman Football Center for the meeting.
'The next three days are a grind for these guys,' said the Bears coach Jim Mora, who is about to enter Tuesday.
The NCAA canceled two daily exercises (designed to mitigate player burdens), but actually extended their day-to-day training time - at least by the end of Friday.
This is why the first three training sessions at the University of California, Los Angeles are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. in order to adapt to the player's already congested schedule.
From the cancellation of two trainings a day to more one-day training, the bear team started training almost every day before the last season, and Mora was training at the summer school for the first time in the six seasons of Westwood.
They plan to start 18 trainings starting August 20, and then prepare for the official race for the First Battle of Texas Farmers in September.
He said he supported the NCAA's rules adjustment, although this would make the player's busy schedule add another project.
"We will put a huge amount of training on them in three or four days, which is very challenging," said Mora.
"They've just passed it, they're all practising, they're all great kids.
I think on Saturday, we'll have more time, really good."
At the end of the training camp, University of California, Los Angeles will stop training. Considering nearby parking lots and the clear view of Luskin Center, it's not an easy task. Luskin Center Premium Hotel has been pierced by football throws through the Ball Post Guard.
Starting this weekend, the Bears will be staying at the hotel, but Mora acknowledges that once these rooms are vacant during the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a really worrying question. I think someone might rent a room, sit in the room, record a training scene, and that's not a strong idea.
If you have a training video tape, it is also very good.
However, there are security measures in place, and security measures are also in place at Car Park No. 8.
We use our existing resources to make the best use of them.
I will not be too concerned about this.
We have a plan."

Facebook will launch fact check to combat false news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential prank articles to third-party testing agencies and show the test results below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to beat the so-called fake news.
Facebook said in a statement on its website that Facebook will start using an updated machine to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to the fact checker, and may show the fact check results below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main dissemination points of the so-called fake news, and many believe that Facebook has impacted the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
This question has also become a major political issue in Europe, before the French presidential election in May, voters encountered the plight of false stories, and Germany was the first to pass the support of the penalty program before the September election, and if social media networks fail to promptly remove hateful posts, they will be punished with fines.

A brief history of the English Castle
Recently, the small Scotty Castle became the main character in a compressive music video and was once a refuge for Mrs Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s.
But Scotty has witnessed a 700-year-old twist in the comfort of the Bellows Valley, Kent, and now it's a source of inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshireman who has a special interest in historical files and left the drag and drop head).
"Look at the traces of the old man 300 years ago, I found it to be really beautiful," he said with his eyes wide open.
"What kind of interpersonal relationships can make this letter fall into my hands?"
Across the Middle Ages and through to the Edwardian era, the book "A Castle in England" records the families of Scotty, where each story is made by different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first file-based book by Lodz: he has also written "The Teeth and Other Stories of the Dead 2014", a book inspired by the British Library literature, a work that he has no control over his passion for creating.
"From the moment I saw the thumbprint left on one side of the letter, I could not suppress my impulses in writing, which was written by a duo of 18th-century agents working for the Jacobian army," he said.
"That's his fingerprint!"
And the letter has always smelled like a stock smoke, because at that time, you need to light up the fire.
For us, 300 years from now, this kind of smell will make people feel like they are on our side.
Oh, I like the archives!"
For those who are moved by the old paper, the English National Trust and the Art Council can be supported and lived in the castle for almost four months (the "Really, I stayed for a long time") seems awesome, and it simply doesn't believe it is true.
Lodz spent several days visiting Victoria's "new" castles, reading archives, researching many treasures and antiques in the temples, such as tucked on the walls, and having spent several centuries in the waterfront bottles, etc.
He walks on the land and ruins of the old castle, with the wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes chats with the illustrator in his book.
Later in the evening, he will "sniff a whisky and write it."
Scotty's secret history is not yet clear, as the "National Trust" only enters completely after Elizabeth Hesse, the last successor of the British National Trust, died in 2006.
Ten years later, when Loz arrived, the staff began to deal with the archives, and he described them as "a few hundred years ago the nobles have gone away: "Oh, put it in the loft."
A diary, a letter from the British Empire, depicts the maps of various national boundaries: "You will think that land disputes will be boring," said Loz. "But there will be two families who will play a big hand in order to create a white oak tree."
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the work take castles as a starting point, and thus explore the history of Britain at a broader level, including The Labourer, the story leads to a person who left the newly built castle to take part in the 1381 peasant uprising.
"The book, known as Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, records a riot that took place in the castle in 1380," Loz said.
"The peasant uprising started in that area, and I think there is a good place to start up the uprising.
Is there any connection between the two?"
The other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darel family's seven-year history of hiding a pastor of Jesus Christ during the Reformation in Britain.
Or The Smuggler, the owner of the story is Arthur Darrel, an 18th-century smuggler, who is considered to have held a funeral for himself by filling the coffin with stone blocks (a few years later his coffin was exposed to the ground and people felt it).
The Darrells is Lodz's favorite family of Scotty Castles: "These gentlemen seem unstoppable, always borrowing money, and then spending money to buy something they can't afford.
A generation of Darer men by marrying wealthy women to solve their debt problems, I think they should be a group of handsome young men, who know how to pursue women."
With the end of his mission in the castle, Loz began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wilderness of Finland to complete a drawing novel about "El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki", which was an early 20th-century nursing home, and later it was slowly abandoned.
Scotty has a special place for him.
'I'm so sad to leave,' he said.
"It's like, 'Oh, I have to face the real life of the tank cake.'
According to the press, the company's headquarters is in Zhuhai, and the operator is the executive vice president of ZTE Communications.
Each of the large energy companies is "frozen", so who is the most profitable among many energy companies in the world?
Yesterday, the famous PFC energy company announced the top 50 listed energy companies in 2011, the American oil and gas producer ExxonMobil with a market value of US$4063 billion, China oil and the Netherlands royal seal followed.
In this PFC list, PetroChina was asked twice in 2007 and 2009, and the top position in other years was occupied by ExxonMobil.

U.S. Amendments to Green Card Rules
In a statement by President Donald Trump, the United States will introduce a new immigration program to amend the green card requirements.

The new provisions are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
"The law will reduce poverty and raise wages, saving taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the way the U.S. distributes green cards to citizens of other countries," Trump said.
The law will replace the current program and reduce the number of chain immigrant.
This new application process is useful for applicants who speak English, have financial support, and have skills that are beneficial to economic development."

In order to optimize the environment of the scenic area, the construction of beautiful Nanyue, recently, the Nanyue District Tobacco Bureau (Branch Office) "636" volunteer service team carried out the "Mountain protection forest, love home" environmental protection activities.

The sex machine is really upsetting, but we should be careful.
When you think 2017 is not going to be even better, a new technology development report has been released in the field of sex robots.
Yes.
Today's robotics is a big thing.
The Responsible Robot Foundation (FRR) recently released a report looking at the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to the University of Sheffield Professor of Robotics and Honor and FRR Co-Founder Noel, we need to start taking care of the rise of the sex robot.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, nipples and nail types.
"People are laughing behind them, but major companies do launch a lot of love robots, and we will see more."
Modern love dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robotics, they have silicone skin, they touch very warm, and they have a purpose to use artificial intelligence to set human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also "customize" their robots to meet their preferences, from eye color, nipples shape to nail type or color.
But what's even more disturbing is that many robots with "personality" will make "copying" wives look very advanced.
The modern love toy has evolved into a robot with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix bots can be customized according to the attractive characteristics that users see, such as shyness.
There is also a Roxxxy Gold robot developed by True Companion Inc., which can pre-set personality traits, including a slightly shy "cold gorgeous Farah" and a "happy adventure" "wild winter".
“Roxy Gold robots have as many personality as you can,” said True Companion.
So she loves you, and she hates you.
She's just like normal people in those days.
She can be lazy, can be healthy, can also be 'sexy'!
The rise of the sex robot brings a lot of anxiety - not only replaced the real human relationship - but also the feminine characteristics of the humble knee, as well as the irritating sexual assault hints on the Farah.
True Companion compares Roxy to a man's vibrator on its website.
The website says "If a woman has a vibrator, then why can't a man have Roxxxy?"
However, these robots are not a pure love, nor a sex toy.
Their appearance and growing maturity directly point to the darker, deeper part of our culture: from the perfect gender equality to the sex of the observance as an additional option.
Of course, most men don't have a sex robot, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more and more popular, they are still on the edge of a consumer culture.
However, what comes out of the border allows us to see the process of this era in which we are living.
A lot of people will not be surprised or offensive until the free market gives them the opportunity to become like this.
These delicate sex robots appeared in the era of the threat of the rights of a global woman, and the White House also had a president whispering sexual violence against women, which is not a coincidence.
The TV drama "The Story of the Woman" is not the realistic part of the screen, not the hanged body, not the eyes that are excavated, but the image that is too real.
The Chile Republic was a jump, but now it doesn't seem that far away.
The goal behind these sexbots is to make the most of the technology possible to create the body of the most real woman (although according to the proportion of porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have a human sense and mimic real human movements.
But honestly, their "personality" does not represent real women.
They can't break up and can't get out.
They have no recourse, no follow-up story, no independence, and no possibility to break the complete slavery fantasy.
In other words, they are slaves.
Or, according to the general rule of 2017: women.

Deng Chao said, "I don't do the same thing in a performance, it's constantly updated."
Trump's great achievements?
Mitt Romney is a common sense commemoration.
Political disparities have led to the polarization of U.S. voters, which, from a micro perspective, destroyed U.S. family harmony. This is no surprise for the Trump era.
Before Christmas and Thanksgiving, the major U.S. newspapers were covered in the comment section on how to deal with the fear of voting for Trump's family members.
We usually think that we are doing everything we can to break our "filter bubble".
Less is more to say about the power of Trump to bring his family together.
I mentioned this because of my sister, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has been with the Republicans in our home for a long time, and this week he will come to New York to visit me.
She reminded me that uniting against common enemies can have a powerful effect.
Since working with Trump in the White House, she knew all the people, even the relatives of the Republicans who had been politically controversial for decades, now suddenly and strangely stand on the same front.
This is certainly a good thing if you are at the table, but I am surprised that from a broader perspective, this poses a significant risk.
Although left-wing people have always been motivated by Trump, the turmoil that he brings as president drives us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the possibility of concern that his quirky behavior might stop one day.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scenario, Trump wants to "normalize" the relationship with the right-wing Republicans, who had opposed Mr. President's standards before, and now suddenly appeared as a rational symbol.
I found myself a little quirky about the Mitt Romney version: putting dogs in the car, 14% of the income tax (but at least we know about his tax return), which seems to be too small for the two offenses compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate only needs to be reasonably qualified to make immeasurable improvements.
When my sister-in-law lives in town, we take the kids to New York Park, which is the largest rotating wooden horse run by the New York Central Park Administration, if you don't need coffee, these three dollar tickets are your most consumer value in the city.

35 years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, I found out that this "Swiss Cottage" is not really a Swiss Cottage, but a "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" located in the theme bar, I can't remember, but near a crossroads in the north of London.
However, the centrifugal horse in Central Park remains a magical experience for two 2-year-old children, a 11-year-old child, and four-year-old girls who can participate, everyone is very happy.
If I could rate the rotor, I would give it full, but luckily no one asked.
But this week at a department store, I was asked to give a five-star rating on my transaction "experience" before brushing my credit card.
This is also true in the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and you can choose to rate it with a 15% tip, which is to buy something on the counter.
This effect not only reduces the speed of this should be neutral, but also puts pressure on the service staff, adding personal factors to the unwanted situation.
The poor woman in the department store smiled, and I was tired, and the credit card transaction experience gave her a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistolis Transferred from Prison to Hospital for Chest Pain
It was the second time Pistolis had left prison and transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for wrist circumcision, and the prison official claimed that the injury was caused by him falling in the cell.

Pistolis claims that his girlfriend misinterprets the fact that she is hiding in the middle of the night.
Prosecutors have announced that they would like to appeal again, which was a six-year prison sentence against Pistolis, who thought the sentence was too merciless.
The National Prosecutor's Office said it would file an appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa this year.
If prosecutors win, Pistolis faces a prison sentence of up to 15 years.
South Africa has no death penalty.

Do meat, dairy products and chocolate help relieve inflammation (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like a dream of your digestive system.
But a new study showed the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy can help relieve the symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
The disease affects about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British people in their lives, leading to stomach mites and abscesses, recurring or hemorrhoids, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington often recommend that patients avoid eating meat and dairy to relieve symptoms, but researchers find that protein's key amino acid-isolation contributes to the growth of immune cells, which increase the endurance of the kidneys.
Dr. Marco Colonna, chief researcher, explains that immune cells patrol the nerves to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not go quietly into the body.
Maintain a balance between inflammation-causing cells and increased tolerability cells to protect the body from all kinds of sensitive and fragile tissues.
When the equilibrium state is too polarized, inflammation may occur.
In the experiment, an immune-boosting cell was found in a small mouse carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria require sulfates (one of the components of protein) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Colona said: "We have established a link between a bacterial flora (Roy's Lactobacillus, which is the normal part of the intestinal microbiome) and the development of a resilient cell group.
The more toxins the mice consume in their diet, the more immune cells they are.
He suggested that if humans use the same method, i.e. the combination of Roux Lactic Acid Staphylococcus aureus and sulfate-rich diets may form a more resilient and less inflammatory kidney environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas researched an immune cell that enhances immunity, when she discovered that a group of researchers had this type of cell, but the other group of similar strains did not feed.
She suspects that the difference is related to the intestinal microorganisms of the mice (i.e. bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach tract).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice found that there were six bacterial colonies in mice with immune cells, but none in mice without immune cells.
The mice are fed in a sterile environment, so they lack the intestinal microorganisms and do not appear in this immune cell.
In order to understand how bacteria affects the immune system, researchers developed Rousseau estrogen in the liquid, and then transferred a small amount of the bacteria-free liquid into the unadulterated immune cells separated from the mice.
The immune cells develop into a resilient cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proven that the active ingredient is a byproduct of the serine metabolism, known as pylon-3-lactic acid.
The number of these cells increased by about 50% after the researchers doubled the number of ketamines in the mice feed, but when the level of ketamines halved, the number of cells halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like rats, have the same increased tolerability of cells, and that most of us are present in our gastrointestinal tract.
Is it possible for humans to spur cell development like a small mouse in the experiment, which can lead to the development of serine by-products from the body of Rousseau lactobacillus. It is not yet known, but genetic deficiencies related to serine have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
"The development of these cells may be exactly what we wanted to achieve," she said. "Because these cells can control the inflammatory response on the surface of the kidneys.
It can be said that the high level of ketogenicity present in the ruthless estrogen bacteria may lead to an increase in the number of this species.
José Murion believes that Man United has signed the "Genius" of Nemania Matic
On Wednesday night, Nemania Matich, after the first appearance of the Sanptoria rivalry, Murinio confirmed that Man United had signed a "generous" midfielder.

Is there a global threat to the development of this type of ship in China if it is not built?
With the recent announcement of the world's major naval forces, the construction plan of the new guardships, as one night between guardships has become the focus of the major military concerns, first Japan in the 2018 defense budget to determine the purchase of two new guardships, the Japan DEX guardship program finally has a substantive breakthrough, and then the United States Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest program of the U.S. FFG guardship program, so China's new guardships from where?
With a new 054A guardship in late 2017, the 054A guardship has built as many as 29, has reached the sum of the 053H series of guardships, and since the first 054A downstream in 2006, the 054A has been built for 12 years, even in the world, the construction of such a large number of high-performance general guardships, in addition to China, only the United States in the last century, the "peri" level guardships can be compared and discussed.
And the reason for building such a 054A is simple is that it is affordable, easy to use, plus the addition of many years of navy debts.
054A escort by higher cost ratio and good fighting for many years has been the Chinese navy's blue, its 4000 tons of drainage, equipped with a 76 mm main cannon, 32 unit red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine joint launch drift system, 8 eagle strikes 83 and a direct-9 helicopter, although it was started in 2006, the design time is very early a ship, but its combat force is not too bad to go to the present day, look at the world's escort can reach the level.
However, after all, it is a type of ship designed in the early 21st century, the weapon configuration on one side, its power system and electronic radar equipment and the current world mainstream escort ship has already a big gap, like Europe's same type of escort has been equipped with full power push, small multi-functional control arm radar, large-size helicopter deck, also came to the development of the new model.
So how should China's new security guards develop, which has a direct relationship with its future positioning and the strategic direction of our Chinese navy.
The future development of China's navy will be completely become the blue sea navy, and the future will be to the ocean, with China's vital interests in the region of rapid deployment, show the existence of force, if necessary, can have a strong fighting force to ensure that China's vital interests in the region will not be damaged, so it seems that the new Hu Weijiang will be towards the development of large-scale and oceanic.
Let's take a look at the positioning problems of the new guard ships in the future Chinese navy sequence, the future Chinese navy should be similar to the United States navy, in addition to the necessary near sea defense ships, other main ships will be according to the needs of the situation to form a navy fighting group or two attack ships.
The role of the new escort should be in the future carrier combat groups as anti-submarine main and the positioning of the mid-area airspace, in the two-pronged attack ships should be used as escort ships, so according to this demand, the new escort ships must have a strong anti-submarine capabilities and a good mid-range regional airspace capacity.
Based on the above positioning, the courage to create a future model of national defense ships.
First of all, the current drainage will be a significant increase compared to the current 054A shielding ship, it is estimated that the drainage capacity of the new shielding ship will reach about 5000-6000 tons; the power system will use a QC280 improved gas turbine and two diesel engines to form a comprehensive power-propulsion system, the maximum speed is expected to reach about 30 sections, the battery life will be greatly increased; as for the weapons configuration 76 mm main guns and 1130 near firearms should be retained, but will add a red flag 10 launch system, the main gun will have a 32-48 units red flag 16 improvement and fish-8 common traps, behind the ship body should be installed a large vertical system for the launch of galvanized 18 and new cruise missiles; the library and shutdown platform will also increase, to two 10-level helicopter stop and storage; as well as the electronic radar system, based on the combination of the 346 A.
The overall level of this new escort will reach the world's first level, even compared to the US FFG.
Of course, the above concept is just the author of the guess for the new domestic defense ship, how can we only wait until the new defense ship to the water, let's look forward to it together.

Is China's household debt rate closer to the United States than buying a house?
Over the past few years, we have been discussing the recent changes in real estate policy, whether it is the real estate policy should be loosed?
However, when we are concerned about the real estate price, worried about macroeconomic regulation, worried about the future trend of the real estate market, the People's Daily once again wrote, last time we specifically discussed the review of the People's Daily for real estate regulation of the regulation, and now the People's Daily to write the paper is a more serious issue than buying not to afford housing, this is even if you can afford housing, still can afford debt?
Today we are going to talk about more serious problems than buying a house: loans.
China's growing debt crisis
"People's Daily" overseas edition published on January 17, the comment article "Bonus and Loan: The joy and worry of fighting youth", according to the data in this article, in November 2017, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences National Finance and Development Laboratory, the National Asset Balance Sheet Research Center published the "Three quarters China Deleveraging Process Report" pointed out that the residents' department leverage rate continues to rise trend, from the second quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 48.6%, rose 1.3 percentage points, the three quarters of 2017 up 3.8 percentage points.
The proportion of debt in the residential sector is increased in the total physical economy, and the leverage rate rises faster.
Research shows that Chinese households in financial institutions are responsible for consumer loans, accounting for about two-thirds of residents' liabilities, about two times the amount of business loans.
Among them, in consumer loans, housing loans as the main medium and long-term loans accounted for about 80%, but from the incremental point of view, short-term consumer loans grow faster than medium and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt rate is only statistics of the total credit obtained from the family sector from the financial institutions, and Chinese families also have many, including lending money to relatives and friends in private loans, there is a large scale of hidden debt.
According to the statistics of Suning Institute of Financial Research, China's residents' leverage rate was only 3% in 1996 and only 18% in 2008, but since 2008, residents' leverage rate has begun to show a rapid growth trend, doubled in just six years, reaching 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, residents' leverage rate has reached 48.6%.
In May last year, HSBC released a survey that spans 9 countries and close to tens of thousands of people.
The report was directed at the "Millennium Generation" young people in 9 countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
According to the report, China's 80s and 90s youth housing ownership rate is as high as 70%, Mexico's second largest remote leader (46%), and it is two times the level of the U.S. index (35%).
This data tells us that there is a very likely problem, that is, compared to the purchase of housing, Chinese residents at the present stage of the biggest potential "grey rhino" estimate is still not debt.
What is the most common cause of debt crisis?
As with our previous analysis, although we have always said that China's housing prices are higher, but compared to other countries in the world, China's housing ownership rate is actually very high, so with its high housing prices can not afford to buy a house, I am afraid to ask a lot of friends now are you still able to afford the loan?
We overestimate the real estate market around the world, China's real estate market because of the start of the late, in addition to the previously said Hainan, there has not yet been a large real estate crisis, but in 2008, the origin of the world's financial seaweed was the real estate crisis in the United States.
The real estate crisis in the United States is attributed to two rooms: the real estate and the beauty of the real estate.
At that time in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies in order to expand the sale of the house with a very low down payment to the low-income population of the United States at the time, when the United States economy is good, the real estate market is also a joy and glory, however, the good prospects are not long, with the American economy has a growing stop, causing the income of buyers, so a large number of household consumption expenditure began to decline.
However, at the time, the current state of the United States is a part of the United States family assets financial assets and real estate assets, the United States low-income groups almost all of the family assets are real estate, while the top 20% of the high-income groups are financial assets, so that in the United States the more poor people home real estate liability rate is higher.
A serious fact is that these are all when the economy is better to buy the house, so the payment of the money of the mortgage is also calculated in their better income, when the income comes down, the pressure of the mortgage is not only reduced or even because some of the loan plans have become floating, so the problem of real estate in these U.S. households is gradually transformed into real estate crisis.
Therefore, some people because of the income too low to pay no mortgage, so the bank began to recover the real estate, when the bank from the borrower's hands to recover the real estate, they will be sold at a very low price, which led to a gradual decline in the price of the region, this process also led to further decline in the price, the formation of a malicious cycle, when the price fell to a certain extent, more and more buyers found their home value even lower than their own loans, so there are more people to stop paying the mortgage, but also caused more bad debt.
This is why a great vicious cycle is formed:
"The economic downturn - the income - some people can't afford the mortgage - the low price of the bank sells the arrears of the house - the prices fell - more people stopped lending - the bank sold - the prices fell again..."
And the problem is more so, because the price of the house continues to fall, you stop lending the house to the bank after you don't have any debt, if the bank auction house is not enough money you owe the bank loan, then you still need to follow the money, simply say that you pay the first six million, the loan 2.4 million bought a set of three million houses at the time, when the price fell to this house only two million times, you no longer have to borrow the house to the bank, bank auction house, you don't only lose your first six million, but also owe the bank four million debt, you still have to pay the money.
So, in such a vicious cycle, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed, which eventually led to the 2008 financial crisis in the U.S.
So, at this stage China's household debt rate reached 46.8% high is a very need to be vigilant of the problem, this data at present seems to be lower than the development of the national level, but the problem of the seed has begun to appear, the country has repeatedly emphasized the problem of leverage from last year, which is a very forward-looking judgment, family debt rate if let it continue to climb, will inevitably lead to a huge risk, so to strictly guard against the occurrence of financial risk.
Therefore, after the house is used to live, not to fry the positioning, the country more quickly establish multi-subject supply, multi-channel security, lease and hold and other multiple measures, further to solve the potential risks.
For our individual family, we must give up on real estate speculative thinking, when buying, when the strength to go, to avoid their own family into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt level is a healthy family wealth development road.

British inventors implanted chips in their own body, holding hands to enter the house
A British inventor installs chips for himself, just hold a hand to open his front door, enter the office and even start the car, become the first in the country.
33-year-old Steven Northam implants a small chip between his thumb and his index finger, and is now offering this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives by his company BioTeq.
He has worked with Dr. Jeff Watson, a senior consultant at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.

White House props cost thousands of dollars
According to the military records issued by Times magazine, the White House decided to transport a Navy Army helicopter to the South Lawn last month to honor the great honor of the U.S. manufacturing industry, costing up to $24,000.
The Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as the Navy Warship I), a green-and-white pair, was an important exhibit of the White House's construction project on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
Exhibits include Connecticut-made helicopters, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the first helicopter (HMX-1), the White House Military Office asked the helicopter to be present in accordance with the Daily Order (FRAGO), that is, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern lawn to participate in this "special" event.
The day before the event, the HMX-1 Commander said in an email from the flight commander of the SEAL, "I just want to confirm that you know, because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to take part in the 3 p.m. event and leave after 6 to 9 p.m. on that day after the lawn is cleared.
The information also indicates that once the departure time from the White House is delayed, the return flight is due to the need for a second group of crew members on duty.
The original crew were on standby at the helicopter during the event, and the security crew were on standby near the ground when the aircraft was located.
The records obtained by the Times did not specify whether a second set of personnel was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The report noted that HMX-1 had asked if the activity violated the Act.
The commander wrote: "One of the questions we asked was whether it violated the Hatch Act and was told not to violate it."
'Sounds like you're locked,' the commander replied.
The White House defines this "Made in the U.S." activity as an official event, and therefore is not governed by the Hatch Act.
However, even official events are politically correct.
During the event, the President introduced the topic of the Senate at the time: medical reform, and vigorously advocated the control of government regulations.
The use of Air Force 1 or Air Force 1 aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no longer something new.
The President has been asked to travel on these flights.
However, it is not common to use it for photography purposes only.
Trump was worried in February, when he was in Melbourne, Florida, where the president's agent slowly skated, and eventually stopped his first round of rallies in the background, and his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the former president's use of the president's agent.
The White House Deputy Press spokesperson, Linsai Walters, said, "The White House has been intrigued by the 'U.S. Made in the U.S.' exhibition, which showcases products from all 50 states, made by U.S. workers using U.S. materials."
The HMX-1 pilots regularly conduct flight training near Washington and on the southern lawns, where the U.S. presidents are properly placed in the White House.
Trump took part in the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, when HMX-1 landed 58 times in the White House.
A U.S.-made operational flight is included in this month's crew training requirements.
The helicopter fleet also flew an additional 11 hours of "non-Presidential Support Tasks" that day.
The White House claims that the taxpayer is not responsible for the cost of any other items in this activity.
Sikorsky spokesperson said the company was not involved in the arrangement of the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 does not keep a record of the budget for President's flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact costs incurred for this event.
However, according to the Department of Defense's hourly cost for the fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D's reimbursement fee is $24,380 per flight.
The crew records the flight time of each base flight from the Kantik navy airport in Virginia for 30 minutes.
The White House said the operation of the helicopter was much lower than the cost.
Walters said: "It is very misleading to estimate the taxpayer's expenses based on reimbursement fees.
These estimated costs include staff fees, maintenance fees, and many other costs that are included in the annual installment.
A 2015 RAND study shows that the department's reimbursement fee does not include staff fees, but does include fuel, maintenance, and contract costs.
At that time, former White House press spokesperson Shaun Spark used the helicopter defense for the event,
"The idea is to show what is made in the U.S. this week," he said.
And I know that both Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they all contribute to our national security, and I think that even if there aren't thousands and hundreds of people working there, I guess.
And I feel like most Americans are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which many Americans don't.
Of course, this is not appropriate."
We don't know if Trump was interacting with the helicopter while visiting the South Lawn at the event, but he was actually sitting in the driver seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump gave a speech to Sikorsky's representative, taking the company he owns and making jokes with the media.
"I'm very familiar with the Sikorsky aircraft," he said. "I have three."

Drew Duffy, senior UK trade union director, said: "We couldn't get a clear picture of the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross from the General Manager of the factory.
