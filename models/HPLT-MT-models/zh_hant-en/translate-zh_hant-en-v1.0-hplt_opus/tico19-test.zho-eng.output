Between January 1 and March 15, 2020, the growth rate of the EU/Europe Economic Area and the UK's new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has increased rapidly.
The cumulative prevalence rate of COVID-19 in various countries in the European Union/European Economic Area as well as in the UK shows a similar trend, confirming that despite different countries at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing.
According to Italy's experience, nationals, hospitals and critical care units need to be more prepared to meet the surge in the number of COVID-19 patients, especially critical care tasks.
On December 31, 2019, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China reported a number of cases of pneumonia due to unknown causes.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control reported that the pathogen is a novel coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far shows that about 80% of COVID-19 cases are light, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most can be recovered.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progressed as a critical illness and needed hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases progressed as a critical illness and a critical care.
The mortality rate in hospitals due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trend of the COVID-19 cumulative growth rates among various countries in the European Union, EU/European Economic Area (EEA), and the UK (UK), and compared it to Hubei Province, China.
We have also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK between January 31 and March 15, 2020 to Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to that of China.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) chief executive announced that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the European Monitoring magazine published on March 5, 2020, Spiteri et al reported the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe based on WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020, with patients returning to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK have been tested for COVID-19, including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths that day, including only Italy reported 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
The cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country every day at 8:00 a.m., which are only available through official sources, such as the Ministry of Health, National and Regional Health authorities of each country, and WHO.
This data has been used to assess the COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with Italy.
We calculate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK for 14 days from January 1 to March 15, 2020 as an indicator of the incidence of active COVID-19 cases in order to consider the natural course of COVID-19.
We also offer a total of cumulative cases reported by each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy's data from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
EU/EEA countries and the UK's COVID-19 trends
The trend of the 14-day cut-off of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK is generally consistent with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has increased around February 21, 2020, and then dramatically increased around February 28.
This is largely due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but similar growth trends (additives) have emerged in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK's COVID-19 cumulative incidence rate.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK between 31 January and 15 March 2020, compared with Italy.
It should be noted that as of 8 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries, as well as the UK, have reported a total number of cases similar to Italy in less than 3 weeks.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported in the EU/EEA and the UK is increasing rapidly.
The COVID-19 cumulative prevalence trend has shown that the pandemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although each country is in different stages, the national public health response measures are different, each country may have different definitions of the case, and for the selection must be tested for COVID-19 - including additional tests - the patient's plan is different, but the situation is the same.
In early March 2020, about 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 need intensive care, according to doctors in affected areas in Italy, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have reached their maximum load.
At the EU/EEA level, only 6% and 1% of COVID-19 cases are currently available for hospitalization/or access to a critical care unit, respectively (the data is not shown).
However, this information should be systematically collected in order to supplement the current monitoring of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed that the number of intensive care and medium-term care beds available in European countries varies drastically, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (each 100,000 people in 2010-2011 have 12.5 critical care and medium-term care beds).
ECDC modelled the sixth update to the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment for healthcare capabilities and related scenarios, and estimated the incidence of COVID-19 patients in each EU/EEA country as well as in hospitals in the United Kingdom with a risk of over 90% of the risk of over-hypertension monitoring beds.
Since the cases so far are clustered in the EU/EEA countries as well as in certain areas of the UK, and the hospital and intensive care unit usually serves as a service for identified areas of coverage, it is best to provide information about cases and intensive care beds at the "Standard Statistical Region Unit 2" (NUTS-2) level.
The current trends in Italy and other countries indicate that the EU/EEA, as well as the UK's COVID-19 pandemic, are developing rapidly.
As a result, countries, hospitals, and critical care units should be prepared to address the increased number of COVID-19 patients in the SARS-CoV-2 continuing community transmission and the need for healthcare, especially in critical care settings such as the presence of COVID-19 in the affected areas of Italy.
As the most recent ECDC rapid risk assessment points out that a fast, positive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, as the rapid growth of the number of cases is expected to lead to insufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt the measures.
The rapid risk assessment also outlines public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is currently a temporary opportunity window where countries may use this to further increase control to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health care system.
Otherwise, the healthcare system in other EU/EEA countries is likely to face a surge in patients in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world so far, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths and a huge human catastrophe.
Similar to its SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to be infected with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted by bats and caused similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS, it is more transmissible, older people are more affected than young people, and men are more than women.
In view of the rapid increase in the number of publications related to COVID-19, this article would like to conduct a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly developing research topic.
We will introduce the basic knowledge of epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented memory for Chinese people, an outbreak of a novel viral disease that forces everyone to stay home for the entire holiday and for several weeks following.
The virus is highly homogeneous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; as a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and related diseases are known as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country, and then spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases, over 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 has become a "head-of-the-line enemy" and that its threat may be beyond terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since January 7, 2020, the first report has been separated from multiple patients in the virus sequence, in less than two months there have been more than 200 papers published about COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment.
This article aims to summarize the research progress in this emerging scientific field.
People are accustomed to comparing COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss the knowledge we have learned so far about the disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some urgent questions to be addressed.
In the past, CoV was considered to be a non-lethal pathogen for humans, causing about 15% of common colds4.
However, this century has experienced two high-caustic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which erupted in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible disease rates and mortality rates.
The COVID-19 pandemic is the third COVID-19 outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, Wuhan first reported a number of cases of pneumonia to the Chinese National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was announced.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first fatalities.
At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, the medical staff were reported to be infected and indicated that there may be a passing person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan closed and closed all public transport.
On January 24, only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan Nanhai Fresh Market, which was considered the starting point of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO announced the outbreak as a "global health emergency."
As of this report, the disease has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
Due to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided an updated description of this epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 can infect people of all ages, but the primary age is 30-65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of people infected are over the age of 50, with very few under the age of 20 and only 14 people infected under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/10 million) more than women (0.27/10 million).
COVID-19 is primarily aggregated in Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from illness to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from illness to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base regeneration number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons showed an index-level increase by January 23, 2020, in line with the large-scale population flow time before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases is 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients is 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.5%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (â¥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large diaphragm virus family that contains a single chain of justice RNA.
They can be divided into four entities, Î±, Î², Î³ and Î´, where Î±-CoV and Î²-CoV are known to infect humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV's diaphragm slicing glycoprotein (S) is combined with its cell receptor vascular tension enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptide enzyme 4 (DPP4), and then the membrane fusion occurs.
The virus RNA genome is released into the cytokines; after the genome is replicated, the RNA genome forms a cytokine containing the virus along with the diaphragm glycoprotein and the nucleotide protein, and then fusion and release of the virus with the diaphragm membrane.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
The SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of Î²-CoV, with a genetic consistency of more than 99.98% of the 10 sequencing samples collected from the fresh market in Wuhan, China's South China Sea, which originally erupted.
Compared to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar in terms of genes to SARS-CoV.
By transmitting an electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultra-thin slices of the epithelium.
Human ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, S-proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are weaker compared to human ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-2, which is in line with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes severe infections in patients less than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded by orf3b and secretion proteins encoded by orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in virus pathogenicity and suppress the expression of IFNÎ²; however, ORF8 does not contain any known functional structure domains or base sequences.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported that the ACE2 cold-free electron microscope (cryo-EM) structure with the amino acid transfer protein B0AT1 compound was formed, with a resolution of 2.9 Ã.
They found that the complex had an open and closed image, composed of dipolymers, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could be combined with two S proteins, providing evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origins and Intermediaries
It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and spread to humans through the beavers and stalks.
By comparing the development of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoV systems, bats are considered as natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2, because this new virus is similar to the two SARS-like CoVs from bats - named bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 - with 96% consistency.
However, it is not clear what intermediate hosts can help spread the virus across the barrier of species to humans, and how it can spread.
Ji et al. proposed that the snake was a virus carrier from bats to humans, which involved the reorganization of the same source inside the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China believe that, given that in pangolins, a long kissed veterinary veterinary veterinary veterinary veterinary medicine is often used in Chinese medicine - a coV found with 99% of the genes of SARS-CoV-2, it is believed that pangolins are potential intermediaries of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes remains a huge difference; therefore, specific evidence remains to be provided with decisive results (Fig.33).
The rationality of SARS-CoV-2 is largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a dry environment for up to 48 hours and can survive for up to 5 days at 20Â°C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reportedly sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat - 56 Â°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, chlorine imitation and other lipid solvents can effectively extinguish the virus, but chlorine has not been effective in extinguishing the virus.
Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so it is susceptible to this new virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous research on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus will first be identified by the host's inherent immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-cluster receptors, Toll receptors (TLRs), NOD receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
Viruses are synthesized by different channels of influencing the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturity of stagnate cells, and Type I Interferometers (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the proliferation of the virus's antigen macrophages.
However, SARS-CoV's N-protein can help remove the virus from the immune response.
The adaptive immune response will soon join the ranks of anti-virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+T cells directly kill cells infected with virus.
Auxiliary T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help prevent the above-mentioned cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing the death of T cells.
Body fluid immunity, including supplements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, is also essential for the prevention of viral infections.
For example, antibodies separated from the recovered patients are able to neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive responses to the immune system can produce a large number of free radicals locally, which can cause serious harm to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, can lead to multiple organ failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to affect older adults and pregnant women who have multiple congenital conditions.
In general, the chance of infection of an infected individual exposed to a large number of viruses or immune functions is higher than that of others.
According to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days, based on population statistics of 8,866 cases.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust the effective isolation time according to the most accurate incubation period, which prevents the transmission of virus to others without symptoms.
As a practice, people with a virus or infected person usually isolate for 14 days.
Is it possible to extend the period of isolation to 24 days?
Heat is usually the main and first symptom of COVID-19. It can also be accompanied by symptoms such as coughing, urination, muscle pain, headache, headache, pharynx, fluidity, chest pain, abdomen, vomiting and vomiting.
Some patients experience difficulty breathing and/or hypoxia one week after the occurrence of the disease.
Severe patients will quickly progress into acute respiratory syndrome, toxic shock, parasitic acid poisoning and blood clotting dysfunction.
Even if there are no abnormalities in lung imaging, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should also have a virus screening for early diagnosis.
A statistical study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms were: fever 98%, cough 76%, difficulty breathing 55%, diarrhea 3%; and 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Two recent studies on family aggravation and symptoms-free individual transmission have reported similar results.
In contrast, a 2012 population statistics study showed that MERS-CoV patients also have primary symptoms of fever (98%), cough (47%) and difficulty breathing (55%).
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, far more than those with COVID-19, and MERS has a higher mortality rate than those with COVID-19.
In MERS patients, it is also observed that diarrhea (26%) and pharynx (21%).
Among SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), difficulty in breathing (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and pharynx (13-25%) are the main symptoms, and about 14%-20% of patients need ventilation support.
As of February 14, 66,576 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide and the mortality rate is 2%.
As of November 2002, the mortality rate for SARS was 10% in 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate for 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%, according to a population statistics study conducted in June 2012.
In an early study, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47,95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 lists comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data shows that the spread capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the cause of death is lower than the latter.
As a result, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Aggregation usually occurs in the same family, or from the same gathering or transportation, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other areas of the epidemic within the last two weeks before the occurrence of the disease, or have close contact with the infected person or patient.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and the patient who has been discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, thus issuing a warning to extend the isolation time.
The number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages of the disease is normal or reduced.
For example, it was found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19 that the leukocyte count was 4Ã109/L-including lymphocytes count &lt; 1Ã109/L- lymphocyte decreases, as well as the levels of aminotransferase levels of hydrochloride, as well as viral hemorrhoids.
Some patients see elevated levels of hepato-enzymes and cytokines in the blood, and most patients see increased levels of blood C-reactive protein and blood precipitation.
Heavy-duty patients can see increased levels of blood fiber protein degradation products D-dipolymers and the decrease in lymphocytes.
Most COVID-19 patients can see anomalies in chest imaging, characterized by double-sided plaque or glass mirroring of the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the event of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation, and conductive fibrosis can seriously damage the gas exchange.
Type I and Type II pulmonary epithelial dysfunctions reduce the level of surfactants and increase the surface tension, thereby reducing the expansion of the lungs and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst chest imaging finds that it is usually at the same time as the most serious disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathology analysis of COVID-19 was found in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease to discover that the epithelial cells of the lungs were removed, formed transparent membranes, paralyzed lymphocytes, and multinuclear cells, consistent with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS, similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used to diagnose COVID-19 through reverse transcripto polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.
However, due to the higher false negative rate, China began to diagnose with clinical performance on February 13, 2020 (and no longer rely solely on RT-PCR).
A similar incident occurred during the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, combining medical history, clinical performance, laboratory tests and imaging results is essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the CRISPR team reported a program that uses CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2 without complex instruments, which can detect only 20 Ã 10-18 mol/L to 200 Ã 10-18 mol/L (10-100 Î¼g per virus copy) synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in less than an hour using a test paper.
If certified in a clinical sample, this new technology is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of the diagnosis.
Due to the lack of experience in treating novel coVs, doctors mainly provide support for COVID-19 patients while trying various treatments used or proposed for other coVs - such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV - and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, rehabilitated patients' plasma, medication and psychological support.
It is even recommended to use the blood plasma of patients who have been recovered for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning, and may also indicate other organs of ACE2 at a lower level, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threats and major causes of death to patients.
Therefore, breathing support is essential for relieving symptoms and saving lives, including regular oxygen absorption, high flow oxygen absorption, ignition and mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive extracorporeal oxygen (ECMO) support, an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technology for the treatment of heart or respiratory failure that is life-threatening.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of infectious and toxic shocks, as well as protecting vital organ functions is essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
As we all know, overabundance of immune system reactions in SARS and MERS patients can lead to cyto-factor storms.
A cytokine storm is a form of inflammatory reaction in the whole body, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IFNÎ±, IFNÎ², IFNÎ³ and MCP-1.
These cytokines can induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main causes of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunity suppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in critical patients.
Corticosteroids and torso monoclonal antibodies - an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies - have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine storms include: regulation of T-cell targeted immune response; blocking IFN-Î³, IL-1 and TNF; suppression of JAK; bonatopic antibodies; cytokine signal transduction inhibitor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
As an immune inhibitor, steroids are widely used to treat SARS to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not beneficial for severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially asymptomatic bone death, which can seriously affect prognosis.
However, it is still recommended to use low-dose corticosteroids for short-term treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Effective antiviral therapy has not been confirmed at the time of writing.
However, it has been discovered that Radixive, a nucleotide analogy, intravenous drugs are effective for a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Red Seave is a novel antiviral drug developed by Glyde that was originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola virus and Marburg virus.
It has also been shown that Rexel may inhibit other single-chain RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gideon has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials of people with SARS-CoV-2 infections.
In addition, it is recommended to use Barictinib, Î±-interference, Lopinave/Littonave and Libavelin as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Lopinava/Litonava combined treatment may result in diarrhea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The interaction between these treatments and other drugs used by the patient should be carefully monitored.
Blood plasma and antibodies for patients who have recovered
Blood is collected from patients recovered from communicable diseases for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from infection.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies to pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are an immune globulin (Ig) that is produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other parasites, which can identify and neutralize unique molecules in the pathogens.
Based on this principle, blood plasma is collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and then injected to 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms are improved within 24 hours, while discovering decreased inflammation and viral load, increased blood oxygen levels and increased concentrations.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify methods that can be used at scale before the development of specialty therapy.
In addition, considering the effectiveness of the treatment, some of the disadvantages associated with blood plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune responses and cause cytokines to release syndrome, which can be life-threatening.
Antibody concentration in the blood is usually lower, and the blood pressure in treating critical patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce special antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, the most important and practical way is to separate the B cells from the recovered patient body and identify the genetic code of the encoded effective antibodies, or to select effective antibodies for the proteins necessary for the virus.
In this way, we can easily expand the production scale of antibodies.
In China, TCM has been used to treat multiple diseases for thousands of years.
However, the effect of treatment depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple ingredients in the prescription, and the prescription varies according to the diagnosis of the TCM theory of disease.
Most active ingredients are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the leading alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from the critical stage of treatment due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for COVID-19.
For example, it has been found that erosion detoxification capsules and hyaluronic acid capsules are effective for COVID-19 treatment.
In some provinces of China, 87% of patients use TCM treatment, where they observe the highest rate of cure for patients with COVID-19, including gallbladder (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province only uses TCM treatment in about 30% of patients with COVID-19, with a minimum cure rate (13%).
However, this is just a rough comparison, as many other factors should also be included in the assessment, such as the number and severity of the patient.
On February 18, 2020, Chrysler and his colleagues published a study on the treatment of WM and TCM alone.
They found that the time required for WM+TCM group temperature recovery, loss of symptoms, and hospitalization was significantly shorter than that of a pure WM group.
The most impressive is that the deterioration rate of symptoms (from light to heavy) of a WM+TM group is significantly lower than that of a pure WM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate of a WM+TM group is also lower than that of a pure WM group (8.8% vs. 39%).
Still, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still requires higher quality of peer-to-peer testing, greater scope, and more centers to be validated.
The mechanism of action of TCM treatment or its composition and, where possible, clarification of its active ingredients will also be of interest.
People who are suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 are mostly afraid of such a highly contagious or even fatal disease, and those who are isolated can be painful, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse reactions to treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.
A series of psychological responses have been reported in the early stages of the SARS outbreak, including ongoing depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychiatry excitement, psychiatric symptoms, delusions and even suicide.
As part of the public health response measures to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contacts tracking and isolation can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, isolation and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to people with COVID-19, suspected cases, close contacts, and the public in need.
Psychological support should include building a multidisciplinary mental health team that communicates clearly by regularly and accurately updating information and treatment plans for SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, using professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential for breaking the chain of dissemination from animal hosts and infected patients to vulnerable hosts, and are often used as complementary means of antiviral treatment in controlling the outbreak caused by emerging viruses.
The industry has worked hard to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and effective neutral antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Anti-drug vaccines have been evaluated in the SARS animal model.
However, these vaccines have not yet been identified in the body's effectiveness in the models of elderly and fatal attacks and their protection against viral infections.
This is likely because SARS has disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, the Middle East continues to have zero-star cases of MERS and aggravated diseases and spread them to other regions because of the persistent source of human and animal disease in the epidemic area.
Through the use of live viruses, DNA granules, virus carriers, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein amino acids, vaccines for MERS have been developed, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for non-immune individuals against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent and critical task to control the current pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this challenge because of the long-term (an average of 18 months) and dynamic changes in CoV due to the need for vaccine development.
As a new type of disease, COVID-19 has just begun to demonstrate its complete clinical process among thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover gradually without any complications.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, people with severe COVID-19 also have a high incidence and mortality rate.
Therefore, establishing a prognostic model of the disease is essential for health care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect the prognosis of or related to COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor that affects the future of SARS, as is the case with COVID-19.
As mentioned earlier, in a study that included 8,866 cases, COVID-19 mainly occurs in the 30-65-year-old age, with 47.7% of patients over 50.
Patients who need intensive care are more likely to have underlying aggregation and complications, and are significantly older than those who do not need intensive care (middle age is 66 for age 51), suggesting age as a pre-planned factor for the end of a COVID-19 patient.
Gender: As mentioned above, men infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more than women (0.31/10 million pairs 0.27/10 million).
Aggregation and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart damage and heart rhythm abnormalities.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also be combined with ACE2, which can lead to abnormal liver function in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age is closely related to the underlying diseases and may affect each other.
Laboratory test results are abnormal: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the seriousness of inflammation or tissue damage and have been treated as a disease, treatment response, and potential prognosis factors that ultimately recover.
The CRP level is also highly correlated with COVID-19 and predictability.
In addition, lactic acid dehydrase (LDH), astronomy aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) increases may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of cardiac or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: The progression of time in chest imaging and clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues to predict the conclusions and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immune inhibitors and are often used as an auxiliary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
Since high dose corticosteroids are widely used in heavy-duty SARS patients, many survivors suffer from hemorrhoid bone death, leading to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in small doses and short time in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, many patients were under tremendous pressure during the COVID-19 outbreak, as they often suffered from long-term isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of relatives and patients.
Psychological advice and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get rid of stress and restore normal life.
The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from the SARS, according to demographic studies to date.
In addition to copying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also be effectively copied in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, which are similar to other CoVs that cause common cold.
As a result, infections can cause a large number of viruses in the course of their daily activities in the early stage or in the incubation stage, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, the spread of SARS-CoV is considered to have occurred in patients with severe disease, and most of the spread is not in the early stages.
As a result, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS.
China is currently making great efforts to block the ongoing isolation of Wuhan and surrounding cities, as well as the discontinuation of SARS-CoV-2 for almost all populations.
Although these measures have been severely damaged in China's economy and other aspects, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the pace of the pandemic is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some of the other experts are not so optimistic.
People like Paul Hunter have estimated that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have developed a model for predicting the consequences of the pandemic, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team in Canada reported that patients who recovered and discharged two weeks ago had SARS-CoV-2 detected in the nasal and pharynx swabs, indicating that this newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to the flu.
However, with the decrease in the number of new cases, China has shown an encouraging sign that the current strategy may have worked.
The Ebola virus has been predicted to cause 1 million cases and 50 million deaths.
However, through strict isolation, the disease is eventually controlled.
Similar to SARS-CoV, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 may become weak and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexistence with the human body.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic against SARS and MERS (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted by coughing or sneezing, or even by direct contact with infected items.
The virus has also been discovered in the kennel, which increases the likelihood of kennel spread.
A recent study, which included 138 cases, found that 41% of cases could be caused by internal infections, including 17 patients who had previously had other illnesses and 40 medical staff.
Therefore, more stringent precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially physicians, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have been in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a mask; the use of surgical masks and the N95 anti-pollution masks (1860s series) can help control the spread of viruses.
A surgical mask prevents liquid drops from the potential infected person from being transmitted in the air or adhered to an object surface that may be transmitted to others.
However, only the N95 (1860s series) mask can prevent inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virus can penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, which is about 85 nm.
Since the virus particles can even penetrate five surgical masks together, medical personnel who have direct contact with the patient must wear the N95 (1860s series) mask instead of the surgical mask.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should also wear isolation clothing to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 with an N95 mask; the virus could have entered its body through an inflammation of the eye.
Therefore, the medical staff should also wear a clear mask or a shield when facing the patient.
For the public affected by the epidemic or the area affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that all people use disinfectant soap to wash their hands more often than usual, stay indoors self-isolation, and limit contact with potential infected people.
Three feet is considered to be a proper distance away from the patient.
These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus that enters the human world, based on a deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak, the highly homogeneous nature of SARS-CoV reported on January 7, 2020 should have caused a high alert to China.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control is still on the sidelines, saying that the infection of the new virus is not strong, the possibility of human transmission is limited, and the epidemic is controllable.
The news has obviously relaxed the public's vigilance, and it is worth the Spring Festival coming, and the pandemic has been curbed at key points in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may learn from this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should (1) be more cautious at the time of the announcement, as each word is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive to abnormal information from hospitals and respond quickly rather than waiting for a formal report from doctors or officials; (3) more stringent control over potential outbreaks early rather than trying to please the general public; and (4) more frequent targeted and effective exercises to improve public awareness of the epidemic and to regularly test and improve the social response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, it has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world in less than two months.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 appears to be like a SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial to controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
Elderly people affected by COVID-19 are more young than women, men are more than women, and the severity and mortality of elderly patients are also higher than young patients.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
Even if there is no symptoms, people with COVID-19 can still spread the virus, and SARS patients often only spread the virus if they are in severe conditions, which can result in far more difficult control of the spread of COVID-19 than the SARS.
This part explains why the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is much faster and more extensive than the spread of SARS-CoV.
In some patients with COVID-19, the results of the regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured may recover again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of virus transmission.
Considering the rapid development of COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be addressed:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of 96% of the same geneality between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats like SARS-CoV-2, we cannot conclude from the bats.
Which animal is transmitting the virus from the original host - assumed as a bat - to the middle host of mankind?
If we don't know the answers to question 1 and 2, we can't cut the transmission path effectively, and the outbreak can be repeated at any time.
Although the molecular model and biochemical analysis have proven that SARS-CoV-2 combines with ACE2, how does the virus enter the gastrointestinal cells accurately and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also represent ACE2 cells in other organs?
If there is no clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve fast, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
Is this disease going to last for a long time?
What is the genetic evolution of the virus during human transmission?
Is it going to be a global pandemic, disappearing like SARS, or recurrence like flu?
Finding answers to the above and many other questions is essential, but may take longer.
However, no matter how expensive we are, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and make our lives back to normal.
The origins of human-coronavirus human Liver Disease
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have been driving the common evolution of the coronavirus (Coronaviruses, CoV) and its hosts, including humans.
By 2003, two types of people with coronavirus (HCoV) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has transformed the situation, revealing the destruction and fatality of HCoV infections.
SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in the middle of China at the end of 2019, once again made CoV a focus of concern, is surprising that it is highly circulating but less pathogenic compared to its sister virus SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a human animal disease, so understanding the origin of HCoV's disease will help us.
Most HCoVs come from bats and are non-pathogenic.
Some of the HCoV storage hosts are already known.
Identifying animal hosts has a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.
Researching the interaction of CoV hosts in animals can also give us a deeper understanding of the mechanism of disease of human CoV.
In this review, we outline the seven existing knowledge of HCoV, focusing on their discovery history, the origin of human and animal coexistence disease and inter-dispersion.
It is important that we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome regression.
In this context, we are exploring the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, this article also focuses on the successful completion of host conversion requirements and the serious impact of virus evolution on the disease.
CoV is part of the Corona Virus Division and consists of a group of justice single-chain RNA viruses with membranes.
These viruses have the largest genes in the RNA virus, from 2.6 to 3.2 million alkaline genes, known as the coronavirus (CoV) under the electronic microscope.
In terms of structure, CoV has a non-segmentary genome that shares similar tissues.
About two-thirds of genomes contain two large open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab compounds.
These polyoproteins have been further processed to produce 16 non-structured proteins, known as nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome includes ORFs for structural proteins, including stabs (S), wraps (E), films (M), and nuclear proteins (N).
A number of spectral-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by different spectral-type CoVs.
Depending on the protein sequence, CoV is divided into four genomes (Î±-CoV, Î²-CoV, Î³-CoV, and Î´-CoV), where Î²-CoV consists of most HCoVs and is divided into four genomes (A, B, C, and D).
The systemic developmental evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genetic sources of most Î±-CoV and Î²-CoV, while birds are the main hosts of Î³-CoV and Î´-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has been across the barrier of species, some of which have become an important source of human disease.
To date, there have been 7 infections with coronavirus (HCoV).
The HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are Î±-CoV.
The other 5 types of Î²-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 have high pathogenesis, causing severe lower respiratory infections in more patients, and are more likely to develop into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and out-of-pulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was separated from the nasal secretion of the common cold.
Since then, through extensive studies of HCov-229E and HCov-OC43 viruses that can cause self-limiting symptoms, humans have accumulated more knowledge.
In fact, before the SARS outbreak, the concept of infecting HCoV is generally widely accepted.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most destructive events in history, with more than 8,000 infected people and about 10% fatality.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic spreads on the Arabian Peninsula and spreads to other parts of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is a pathogen for the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As of March 3, 2020, more than 3,120 lives have been taken and more than 91,000 people have been infected.
The alarm has arrived, and the world must be ready for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All 7 types of HCoV have human and animal communal origins from bats, mice, or domestic animals.
A variety of evidence shows that all HCoV evolution originated from bats, the virus in the bat body is good adaptability, no pathogenic, but shows a very large genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Track HCoV's origin of zoonotic disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and limiting factors of the jump of a viral species.
In addition, this will also guide or promote the search for SARS-CoV-2 archiving hosts, intermediate hosts, and expansion of animal hosts, which are of great importance to prevent future virus spills.
In this summary, we outline the origins, intermittent transmission and pathogenesis of HCoV.
In particular, we have highlighted and explored a common topic, that is, HCoV's progeny virus is usually not pathogenic in its natural repository host, but it is pathogenic after the spread of cross species to the master of Shinjuku.
In addition, we also recall the trend of HCoV evolution, in which the increase in transmittability is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
In this context, we have discussed the results of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Since the end of the twentieth century, animal CoV has been widely known.
Before the first release of the HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal secretion of common cold patients, physicians have separated from a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven types of HCoV have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovered in chronological order (Table 1) will provide us with rich information and have a sense of direction.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E strain was separated from the upper respiratory tract of the patient and subsequently adapted to growth in the WI-38 pulmonary cell.
People who are infected with HCov-229E have common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort, sore throat, and 10 to 20% have fever, cough and other symptoms.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 separated from the organs of the mice's brain and the subsequent continuous generation.
The clinical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to that of the HCoV-229E infection, and there are no significant differences in symptoms compared to other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and nasal viruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide, mainly in the winter of the temperate climate.
Usually, the incubation period of the two viruses is less than a week, and after that, it develops approximately 2 weeks.
A human volunteers study showed that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E will experience a mild flu.
Only a small number of patients with low immune function have experienced severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first documented pandemic disease caused by HCoV in human history, with its pathogen being SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
SARS cases can be traced back to the late 2002 province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 cases, 774 deaths, spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to the super spreader, it is estimated that each case could bring about 2 cases of incubation, with a period of 4 to 7 days, with a peak viral load on the 10th day of the disease.
People infected with SARS-CoV initially showed symptoms of muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort and cold war, followed by late symptoms such as difficulty breathing, coughing, and sedation.
Lymphocyte reduction, liver function check abnormalities and creatine kinase rise are common in SARS laboratories.
In addition, in SARS patients, it was observed that roaming lung damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and macrophages increased.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these critically ill patients, a number of organs, including the stomach, liver and kidneys, may also be infected and are usually accompanied by a cytological factor storm, which can be fatal in patients with low immune function.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung test of a family member who travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been working on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands by the end of 2004.
The virus was first found to be popular in young children, the elderly and immunodeficiency patients with respiratory diseases.
Among the diseases caused by HCov-NL63, there are common nasalitis, conjunctivitis, fever and fine bronchitis.
Another independent study showed that the same virus was isolated from the nasal cavity specimens of an eight-month-old boy in the Netherlands who had pneumonia.
Although the virus was discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for around 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, peaking in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to obstructive phlegm (also known as glucoma phlegm).
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong due to pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to the community's access to pneumonia and fine bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 is also reported to be associated with acute asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide to cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four communities have been well adapted to humans and are often less likely to have mutations that cause high-risk diseases. But there are also unexpected occurrences and unknown causes, such as a more toxic rare subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs are obtained in the human body the ability to effectively spread and survive, their toxicity or pathogenicity will also decrease.
MERS-CoV separated from the lungs of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and kidney failure patient in Saudi Arabia for the first time in 2012.
Despite the fact that most laboratory confirmed cases came from the Middle East, imported cases were reported in European countries and Tunisia, in which there were occasional cases of transient transmission to close contacts.
In 2015, a further outbreak of sexually transmitted diseases occurred in Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical performance of MERS is similar to that of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which is unique to MERS in the disease caused by HCoV to date.
More than 30% of patients experience symptoms of gastrointestinal tract such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were reported in the lab and the mortality rate was as high as 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most damaging viruses known to humans.
In late December 2019, a clustered pneumonia patient was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and the reminiscent analysis confirms that it is related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a global concern for public health and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there have been 90,053 confirmed cases, with a crude death rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the mortality rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, and the mortality rate outside of Hubei, is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe respiratory infections, which are shown to be difficult for fever, cough and breathing.
Some patients also experience diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory comorbidity syndrome.
Despite 82% of high nucleotide sequence homogeneousity, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar, but they are clustered into different branches in the system development tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower in pathogenic compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more contagious.
People with SARS-CoV-2 symptoms have been reported to have shown that the virus can spread rapidly around the world.
Compare and contrast the SARS-CoV-2 with the other 6 types of HCoV, and we can discover very interesting similarities and differences.
First of all, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
The SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of the other 6 types of HCoV.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and 4 communities for access to HCoV (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in the community for obtaining HCoV infections, including non-specific, mild and even symptom-free manifestations.
On the other hand, a small portion of the severe COVID-19 cases are also seen in SARS-CoV infection cases, even with a slightly lower proportion.
Thirdly, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting pattern features of community access to HCoV and SARS-CoV.
The spreadability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community access to HCoV.
On the other hand, whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 will be comparable to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, still pending verification after human transmission.
As with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a condensed sample.
At least in some cases, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is as important as in SARS-CoV remains clarified in future studies.
In addition, it is important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as the community gets HCoV.
However, the characteristics of the spread of SARS-CoV-2, pathogenic and continuous transmission after human transmission will have an important impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All 4 community access HCoVs that cause minor symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans have also adapted to these four types of HCoV.
Both of them are likely to be the survivors of the HCoV pandemic.
HCoV and people with severe HCoV diseases have passed away.
To this end, HCoV must be duplicated sufficiently in humans in order to accumulate adaptive mutations, thereby combating host-limiting factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more infected people are, and the more likely it is to fully adapt to humankind.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop the spread of infection in humans by isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, these 4 communities have spread the coronavirus in the population, causing people with normal immune function to develop common cold.
These viruses do not require animal hosts.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and cannot be continuously spread in humans.
They need to survive and thrive in an animal-positive host, and may find opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediaries and expansions.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 communities with access to HCoV.
It is highly contagious, at least as far as community access to HCoV.
However, it is more pathogenic than getting sexual HCoV in the community, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it fully adapts to humans and, without a host or intermediate animal host, is still to be observed.
Before discussing the origins of HCoV animals, it is important for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of HCoV's evolutionary host, natural host, storage host, intermediate host and expansion host.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor at a high level of the same origin as the nucleotide sequence, the animal becomes an evolutionary host for HCov.
The ancestry virus is usually highly adaptable and undesirable in this host.
In addition, the host will also be able to carry HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host of HCoV or its relatives.
In contrast, if HCoV was just paralyzed by the middle host shortly after or immediately after paralyzed by the human body, it would not be able to adapt well to the host of Shinjuku and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a source of human-infected human livestock commensurate with disease, and then spread it to humans to expand the scale of human infection, thus playing the role of enlarged host.
If HCoV cannot maintain its transmission within the middle host, a terminal infection may occur.
Instead, HCoV can also adapt to intermediaries or even establish long-term locality.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural storage host.
The epidemiological data retrospective analysis found that the SARS indexed cases have a history of contact with hunted animals.
Subsequent hyaluronic acid studies show higher levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) compared to anti-SARS-CoV in general populations.
On the live animal market, beavers (vegetables) and a beaver cat were first discovered to carry SARS-CoV virus that is almost identical to the SARS-CoV virus.
After removing all the fruit from the market, there is no further SARS report, which directly supports the above view.
However, the report says that wild or untouchable farm beavers in the live animal market are essentially negative about SARS-CoV testing, which suggests that the beaver may simply be a medium-enlarged host, rather than a natural host of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that 80% of different animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, so it is not possible to rule out a variety of small mammals that may also act as a medium-sized host in the SARS-CoV.
All of these animals seem to be end-users of SARS-CoV.
A study of SARS-CoV natural animal hosts found a closely related bat coronavirus, known as the SARS-related Chrysanthemum coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survived the Chinese Chrysanthemum.
These bats have a positive genome sequence of SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat coronaviruses are 88-92% nucleotide sequence homogeneous to SARS-CoV.
These studies lay the foundation for a new concept for the host of a new human pathogen.
In addition, researchers have identified multiple SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) from bats, but no virus can be separated from the living virus except for a specified WIV1.
Human vascular tension enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known receptor of SARS-CoV.
It is proven that the WIV1 extracted from the bat pee sample uses bats, beavers and human ACE2 as its receptor for entering the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS recovery patients can neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to the bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homogeneous.
Although both viruses are highly homogeneous, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not a direct relatives virus of SARS-CoV, and the bat is not a direct storage host of SARS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is the same as the Bat CoV-HKU4 and Bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV are invading the virus with the same host receptor dipeptidease4 (DPP4).
MERS-CoV's RNA dependency RNA polymerase sequence is developed in the system closer to the corresponding RNA in bats Î²-CoV from Europe and Africa.
To date, no active MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV is only 87% nucleotide sequence of the same origin as its close relatives and bat CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, the bat may not be the direct storage host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East has shown that monofilament has a positive synthesis of MERS-CoV properties and antibodies, similar to the synthesis of many African countries originating in the Middle East.
The MERS-CoV, which is separated from the nasal swab, is the same as the virus found in the human body, further indicates that the unicorn is the true storage host of the MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that in the uterus of experimentally infected MERS-CoV, the general symptoms are minor, but a large number of viruses are dropped.
It is worth noting that the infected uterus not only transmits the virus through the respiratory tract, but also through the uterus, and the uterus is also the main means of spreading the virus by the bat.
However, the problem persists, as many MERS confirmed cases do not have a history of contact with snoring before symptoms appear, which may be attributed to people or unknown means of transmission, including animals that are not identified with MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homogeneity of bat CoV RaTG13, separated from Chrysanthemum bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the relationship between relatives.
In other words, a bat may not be a direct repository of the SARS-CoV-2 unless the same Bat coronavirus has been discovered in the future.
SARS-CoV-2's mid-range animal hosts should be among the wild animals that are sold and slaughtered in the South China Sea wholesale market, many of the first COVID-19 cases are related, which indicates that there may be a spread of animals to humans.
Recent studies based on macrogene sequencing have shown that a perilous small mammal, known as pangolins (mall pangolins), may also carry ancestry Î²-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin coronavirus genomes have 85-92% of the nucleotide sequences of the same source as SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to the RaTG13, with approximately 90% of the nucleotide sequence levels of homogeneous nature.
In the system development tree, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 virus subsystems, one of which has a more similar receptor convergence domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 and has 97.4% of amino acid sequences of the same source.
In contrast to the formation of this, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is much larger, even though the sequence of full genomes is more homogeneous.
A previous study on the diseased pangolin also reported that the virus heeping group was detected from a pulmonary sample, and the result was similar to the SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different assembly methods and manual treatment, and received about 86.3% of the total genome of the virus.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, since there is a difference in the Î²-CoV sequence associated with SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined.
Despite the discovery of the highest sequence homogeneity in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2-related Î²-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest total genome sequence homogeneity.
The highly similarity between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is highly speculative.
Another opposite view is that pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related Î²-CoV and RaTG13 are reorganised in the third species of wildlife.
As an evolutionary driving force, reorganization is widely available in Î²-CoV.
The origins of the direct human-to-human disease of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been determined.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, researchers have also studied the origins of zoonotic diseases for HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
The systemic developmental evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the Bat coronavirus, while the relatives of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus, known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), found in the North American tricolor bats, is closely related to the HCov-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has a genetic link with another bat coronavirus (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008) discovered in Ghana, and cytobacco animals are also suspected to be the host.
For clarity, Figures 1 and 2 summarizes the existing knowledge about the origins of animals known to HCov.
The system development analysis provides evidence for inter-generational transmission events in HCoV history.
By 1890, when HCov-OC43 infected humans from livestock across species, there was a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases.
The history of HCoV-229E is unknown.
Bat Î±-CoV, which is closely related to HCoV-229E, has been discovered.
There was an alpha-cov between the two.
There are several evidences that support the transmission of viruses directly from bats to humans.
First of all, human beings, not sheep, may come into contact with bats in a common ecological position.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with sheep and goats.
Second, the HCov-229E-related bat Î±-CoV is diverse and non-pathogenic in the bat, while the goat Î±-CoV causes an outbreak of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Sheep Î±-CoV have not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of obtaining Î±-CoV from human-related HCoV-229E cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human-borne viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipa virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats directly spread the HCoV-229E to humans.
Or, even though bat Î±-CoV acts as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, goats and single-peakers can be a medium host that spreads the virus to humans, which is exactly the same as MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is a good indication of the spread from bats to single peaks and from single peaks to human species.
The origin of Bat's MERS-CoV evolution is already well known in its initial determination, and the later discovery also reinforces the argument.
Obviously, bats provide a rich library of viruses for intergenic fragments exchange and intergenerative transmission.
Long-life and dense groups, tight social interaction and strong flight capabilities are favorable conditions for bats to become the ideal "viral spreader".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in single peak for decades.
It adapts well to these ripples, and the ripple has also become a stable natural storage host from the middle host.
MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains a relatively low mutation rate.
It is an accident on the dissemination of the human genome, and because it cannot be continuously dissemination, humanity remains the terminal host of the MERS-CoV.
The role of pangolin in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (if any) is different compared to the role of fertilisers in the spread of MERS-CoV.
In particular, pangolin Î²-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be SARS-CoV-2-related terminal hosts, similar to bees in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is necessary to identify or exclude several possibilities for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First of all, a bat may be a storage host with almost identical SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
Humans may use massacres or coal mines to share their ecological status with bats.
Next, pangolins may be one of the medium expansion hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related virus-related new invasions.
Humans are infected with viruses by killing and eating the game.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Antibody investigations are required for livestock and wildlife.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may be reorganised and adapted to the third species that are in contact with bats and pangolins.
The study of animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors in the virus also play an important role in promoting the spread of coronavirus across the barrier.
First, they have a higher mutation rate in RNA replication.
The mutation rate of the coronavirus is estimated to be "medium" to "high" compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, and the average annual replacement rate of each location 2 is about 10-4 times depending on the adaptation stage of the coronavirus to the owner of Shinjuku.
The coronavirus has a school-to-activation nucleic acid extra-cut enzyme, which removes it will lead to a very high degree of variableity and attenuation, and can not even survive.
Interestingly, known nucleotide-like remdesivir can inhibit corona virus replication by inhibiting this nucleic acid extra-crease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Radix is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of the coronavirus is about one million times higher than its host.
In addition, if the coronavirus does not adapt well to the host, its mutation rate will usually be high.
SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, suggesting that it is more adaptable to humans.
It can be assumed that it has adapted to another host that is close to humanity.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV that is well adapted to the single peak.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause the vaccine and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 to fail quickly.
Second, the larger RNA genome in the coronavirus has an additional plasticity in the modification of the gene mutation and reorganization, which increases the possibility of inter-synergistic evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of the new coronavirus when the conditions are appropriate.
A large number of unique open reading boxes and protein functions encoded towards the end of the genome 3' provides evidence.
Third, the coronavirus has randomly changed the template through a unique "copy selection" mechanism during RNA copying.
In the host of a hybrid container, a chain exchange occurs frequently during the CoV RNA transcription process.
Full-length and genome RNAs from highly homogeneous sources can regenerate to produce new coronaviruses.
System developmental evidence for natural regeneration has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animals such as SL-CoV and Bat CoV-HKU9.
Viruses related to the spread of the host interaction
In addition to the above three virus factors, the interaction between the virus and the host receptor is another key factor affecting the spread of the species.
This article uses SARS-CoV's reorganization as a typical example, showing evidence of positive selections in interstellar transmission events.
Based on a comparison of human-beer SARS-CoV separator strains, researchers believe SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through S protein RBD mutations to achieve this process.
In general, RBDs in the coronavirus S protein interact with cell receptors and are carefully selected by host antibody reactions.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located between 318 and 510 amino acids in the S1 segment, which is combined with the human ACE2 and its concomitant to get the virus in.
The RBD of SARS-CoV identifies ACE2 receptors for various animals, including bats, beavers, rats, and beavers, allowing the virus to spread across a variety of surfaces.
In fact, in RBD, only six different amino acids have been observed in RBD, of which 4 of them are in the convergence sequence of receptors that interact with ACE2 receptors.
K479N and S487T mutations exist in the RBD of SARS-CoV, which may increase the affinity of glutathione interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be essential to adapt to the virus.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S-protein S1 unit is 30%, which means that the combination of S-protein and human ACE2 may change.
Indeed, a study by a frozen telescope showed that the combined affinity between affinity and force is 10 to 20 times higher than the human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would also be useful to determine whether any other common receptor is needed in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also combined with ACE2, but combined with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E amino peptide enzyme N and HCoV-OC43 9-O-acetyl sulfate.
They may also explain why the above-mentioned coronavirus has successfully adapted to humans after cross-breeding from animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the effects of HCoV intermittent transmission are also affected by other host dependencies and limiting factors.
The difference between these hosts proteins between humans and natural hosts such as bats, single-peaks, and rodents can be a barrier to intermittent transmission.
HCoV must deprive the host of its dependencies and break the host's restrictions in order to successfully achieve inter-dispersion.
In this regard, the molecular decision-making factors of the virus-host interaction in this important area remain to be determined and characterised.
Using the latest CRISPR technology to perform unbiased full-genome screening of host dependence and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2 may yield results.
The emergence of new HCoV: Back to the Basics
The diversity of the Bat coronavirus provides ample opportunities for the emergence of the new HCoV.
In this sense, the bat coronavirus acts as a gene pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic regressions are also a driving factor for the evolution of HCoV, and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein encoded gene can completely change the form of the virus.
In SARS-CoV complementary proteins, it is found that they can encode different ORF8 proteins due to the separation of the SARS-CoV-related bat virus, so ORF8 is considered important for adapting to humans.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide deficiencies of SARS-CoV were found in the separate strains.
The ORF8 is divided into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered to be an adaptive mutation that facilitates host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may be over-reacting with Î±- and Î³-CoV spectral systems, where large numbers of smaller recombinant areas are found in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Reconfiguration is also found in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the popularity of MERS-CoV has experienced the reorganization of different spectral systems, which took place in the single peak of Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganization events are also observed in other HCoVs, where HCoV and other animal coronaviruses are reorganised in their unstructured genes.
It should also be noted that manual selection may result in unexpected changes in the virus genome, which is most likely due to the reduction of the choice pressure imposed by the host immune system, etc. that the virus faces.
An example of these effects is the lack of binucleotide in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, which results in a total ORF4 deficiency.
Although the full ORF4 can be observed in bats and swine viruses that are associated with HCov-229E, a single nucleotide insertion is shown, causing transcoding mutations.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the pressure of storing host choice.
After the bat is infected with the coronavirus, it is detected that there is no symptoms or only slight symptoms, indicating that the coronavirus and the bat adapt to each other.
From an anatomy and physiology point of view, bats seem to adapt well to the coronavirus.
For example, the activation defect of the bat inflammatory reaction effectively reduces the pathological changes caused by the coronavirus.
In addition, due to the regular regulation of the inhibitive natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and the main organizational compatibility complex Class I expression level is lower, the natural killer cell activity of the bat is suppressed.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen (ROS) produced by the bat high metabolism can inhibit the reproducibility of the coronavirus, and can be affected by the nucleic acid extracutaneous enzyme, thus providing a choice of high pathogenic pressure for the strain to enter Shinjuku.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus may also be regenerating, leading to new protein or protein characteristics to adapt to host.
There have been three new types of HCoV in the past 20 years, which are not accidental.
The coronavirus does not cause disease or cause minor symptoms in hosts such as bats and turrets.
They do a lot of copying without causing a strong host immune response.
This is why there are no symptoms of carriers and the causes of severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the excessive activation of the immune response and the cyto-factor storm, so the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung damage will be.
In contrast, among symptoms-free carriers, the immune response has been degraded from the coronavirus replication.
The same strategy that makes immune responses dechained may play a positive role in anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
Incontinence in the bats is particularly severe.
Therefore, the use of type I disturbances in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, there are defects in NLRP3 inflammation activation in the bat.
Based on this reasoning, using MCC950 to suppress NLRP3 inflammation may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a general theme based on the generation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although it has been discovered that 95% of bats with SARS-CoV have the same source of nucleotide Î²-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that is 96% the same source of nucleotide with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the beavers and other animals in the market have been carrying the same virus as SARS-CoV, direct intermediaries with SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolins with SARS-CoV-2 have been found to have a significant source of Î²-CoV, which indicates that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts, or that Î²-CoV may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally or unintentionally made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus has become the focus of attention.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our understanding of the importance of the origins of HCV and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.
Massive evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given the contact between humans and bees on the market, shutting down the wet market and killing the bee can effectively end the spread of SARS.
Similarly, given the discovery of multiple spectral systems of pangolin Î²-CoV that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from the wet goods market to prevent the spread of disease in humans.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals is still pending further research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long existed in single peaks.
These knives are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and fur products for locals.
It is widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to imitate the practice of the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and to control the MERS, killing all swine flu.
In order to stop the further outbreak of MERS, other infection control measures should be combined to develop an effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccine.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new gene types may appear, which can cause the outbreak.
A variety of human animals have the coronavirus circulating in the wild.
In particular, there is a high diversity of bat coronaviruses with the potential for common diseases in humans.
There are many evolutionary and reorganised opportunities for these people to live with the coronavirus, which leads to the future that is more easily spread and/or fatal in humans.
In some places in China, the culture of eating wildlife should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the rigorous testing of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we need to develop better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.
They stay in their own natural host until there are overflow opportunities.
Even though bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of the virus, if people are educated and away from bats and other wildlife, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife will be greatly reduced.
In order to better understand the ecological status of the coronavirus and its natural host, it is necessary to carry out continuous monitoring of the mammals, the fact will prove, which is very useful for preventing the spread of animals to humans and for future outbreaks.
Overall, the most effective way to prevent viral disease is to keep people away from the ecological status of natural hosts who share the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 has several defects in the origins of the disease.
First of all, if bats spread an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it makes sense to examine the situation in which bats and pangolins can share an ecological position.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how human contact with bats is still to be determined.
Thirdly, if the third type of mammal acts as a true middle host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, as many mammals, including livestock, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be carried out.
In the case of bats, pangolins or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical relatives will be found in the natural host in the future.
Continuing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases"
On February 6, 2020, our team published the Quick Recommendation Guide for Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) infections, which provides experience and learning from the global pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, based on ongoing research and clinical practice experience, and our awareness of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, diagnostics and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to an opinion on the above guidelines and provided the latest "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" diagnostic criteria under the latest COVID-19 treatment program (version 7) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which is now officially named the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), was named the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation guide and published it online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted a lot of attention.
But please note that COVID-19 is a novel disease, based on ongoing research and clinical practice experience, and our awareness of the disease is gradually improving; therefore, diagnostics and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) published a total of 7 versions of the COVID-19 treatment program between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, some of which have undergone substantial changes.
Now, our guide has received views from Zhou and others who have come up with a simple scoring program based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guide as well as valuable references to this global pandemic.
We would like to acknowledge and thank them for their important work.
However, their proposals also need to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 treatment plan (trial version 7) as well as recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (March 3, 2020), the confirmed cases need to combine one epidemiological historical feature with two clinical performance for a comprehensive analysis, if there is no clear epidemiological history, it is necessary to meet three clinical performance:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in a community that has reported COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 cases (nucleic acid test positive); (3) a history of contact with fever or respiratory symptoms in a community that has reported COVID-19 in the past 14 days of symptoms; and (4) a history of contact with aggregated confirmed cases (more than 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms, such as at home, office, school level, etc., within 2 weeks of symptoms).
Clinical performance: (1) symptoms of fever and/or respiratory tract; (2) visual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes in the early stages of the disease is normal or reduced; and the number of lymphocytes decreases.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases and have any one of the following pathogens or serologic evidence: (1) Real-time PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2; (2) Full-virus genome sequencing shows a highly homogeneous source of the known novel coronavirus; (3) Specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; or SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies change from negative to positive, or â¥4 times higher than acute periods during recovery.
We can see that the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) real-time PCR nucleic acid tests in respiratory or blood specimens have been added.
The fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth edition (February 8, 2020) have been added to the blood specimen pathogen test; the seventh edition has been added to the seroological evidence.
These changes are based on researchers' ongoing efforts to research the best nucleic acid test kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as specimens of respiratory tracts, including blood clotting, which increase the availability of different specimens and provide evidence for the inclusion of positive results of the special antibodies into the diagnostic criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence to remind us of atypical symptoms and symptom-free patients.
Therefore, the flowchart should be updated for people like Zhou as they do not classify people with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
Further certification is required in clinical practice and research.
Finally, we would like to see more direct evidence and ask the reader to give their views.
For diagnosis of suspected cases and confirmed cases, we recommend referring to and following the latest guidelines in the country where the case is located.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely manner to help.
5 new cases of COVID-19 fatalities were reported in Bangladesh, with a record high daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new cases of COVID-19 deaths.

Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to suppress the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the lockdown date to May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians will continue to receive compensation during the national suspension until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state's state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 votes for approval, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against it.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in Mecca and Medina to a full-day curfew; previously, the curfew was only valid between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended home orders until May 1.
Australia's stores reduce the maximum number of health papers per transaction
On Sundays and Saturdays evenings, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles have reduced the limit of each transactional sanitary paper purchase at all of their stores to two packs and one pack, respectively, nationwide.
ALDI has also launched a limited package on Mondays.
These restrictions are posted in the form of messages on the cashier or on the Facebook page that is posted to the chain store.
According to the report, buyers flock to goods because they are afraid of COVID-19, in case they need to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths limits the number of home-delivered hygiene paper purchases to a single package.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced a limit of 4 packs per transaction on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles reported in his March 8 press release that after implementing the restriction of 4 packs, "many stores are still sold out within an hour of arrival" and called the demand "unprecedented," at the same time, ALDI said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that it was "unprecedented."
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, last week's sales were "increased".
Last week, Costco stores in Canberra also allowed a limit of two packages.
To further ease the shortage, Coles ordered larger packaging from suppliers and improved the delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional inventory, while ALDI prepared the inventory for the planned Wednesday specials.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retail Consortium, said retailers were trying to increase their inventory, but the restrictions on truck delivery times made it difficult for local councils.
It is expected that as suppliers strive to meet demand, production costs will rise, and special events will decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early release of inventory, some stores will not be able to hold special Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Mr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Science and Technology, said the store will have a complementary inventory every night.
He said the toilet paper is a large item, so there are fewer inventory, and once it is sold out, it leaves a huge shelf space, which exacerbates the feeling of shortage of goods.
"The view of Coles and Woolworths is that if there are a lot of things on the shelf, goods such as webbers and hand sanitizers can be bought [to] and enough, you may not be so scared," Russell Zimmerman said to ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled health paper, said last Wednesday that they no longer have an inventory.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures sanitary paper and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent sanitary paper, emphasizes that they are working around the clock and are available on weekends to ensure supply.
The real estate site Domain.com reported that due to the less number of auctions held by buyers during the Labor Day weekend, some real estate agents will provide free health paper to the first bidder at a auction held in Melbourne.
NT News is a printed daily newspaper in Darwin City that contains 8 pages of interstitial pages in its Thursday edition of the newspaper, designed to be used as a health paper after cropping.
According to the ABC Australia report on March 3, the store initially did not want to implement a purchase limit, they said they did not plan to implement a purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, hand sanitizer, dry goods, hand sanitizer and face powder.
Similarly, outside of Australia, the British online supermarket OCado limited the purchase quantity of Andres Sanitary Paper to 2 packs per pack on Sunday night.
The World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was a pandemic.
Although the term "pandemic" only refers to the extent of the spread of the disease, not to the degree of risk of specific cases, the WHO points out the need to urge the government to take measures:
âAll countries can still change the process of this pandemic.
If the countries/regions test, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people as a response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO general director.
"We are deeply concerned about the degree of proliferation and seriousness and the degree of inaction."
Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the pandemic was âunprecedented.â
In a CNN statement in February, he said, "In addition to the flu, there has been no evidence of which respiratory virus has spread to the world since it has emerged."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said, "We have never seen the pandemic before."
He continued, "As always, we've never seen a virus pandemic that we can control before."
Prior to entering the new state of the pandemic, WHO identified a sudden public health incident that was an international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said the outbreak, "Most importantly, it is still deteriorating."
As of Thursday, the United States reported at least 126000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak was caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, a public health emergency with international concern on January 30, 2020, and a public health emergency identified as an epidemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 161 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories worldwide, with about 9.7 million deaths.
healing about 36.4 million people.
The mortality rate in China is about 4%, and the mortality rate in regions around the world is between 0.08% (New Zealand) and 13.04% (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and stress.
May be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory compulsive syndrome, etc.
The incubation period from contact with the patient to the disease is 2-14 days, usually about 5 days.
There are currently no vaccines or special effects antiviral treatment options.
Clinical treatment is focused on supporting treatment for the disease. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining a safe distance from others, monitoring suspected infections, and self-isolation.
Official institutions have taken measures such as travel restrictions, isolation, curfew, risk control and closure of workplaces.
The pandemic has led to severe shocks to the global socio-economic environment. Sports, religion, political and cultural activities have been deferred or cancelled, and panic shopping has increased the large supply shortage.
About 99.4% of primary and secondary school and college students in 193 countries and territories have implemented national or local discontinuation measures.
Because of the spread of false virus information on the Internet, there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East Asian and Southeast Asian genomes and appearances as well as groups in severe regions of the epidemic.
However, the reduction of travel and heavy industrial shutdowns have resulted in a decrease in air pollution index and a reduction in carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan (Hubei Province) reported a batch of unexplained cases of pneumonia, and began investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the wholesale market of South China Sea, so the new coronavirus is considered to be a human disease.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. Patients who first discovered were confirmed to have a disease on December 1, 2019, and had no significant connection with a number of cases of the South China Sea fresh market.
Two-thirds of the early cases reported in December 2019 were confirmed to be related to the South China Sea fresh market.
On March 13, 2020, South China Morning Post issued an unconfirmed report saying that the first case could be traced back to November 17, 2019, with patients aged 55 coming from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, according to the World Health Organization report, the number of new cases in China decreased, but the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea increased suddenly, and the number of new cases outside China exceeded the territory for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially mild cases.
As of February 26, the reported relatively small number of cases of adolescents aged 19 and under accounted for only 2.4% of cases worldwide. British chief scientific advisor Patrick Valens estimates that about 60% of the UK needs to be infected with the coronavirus in order to get effective group immunity.
The number of cases is the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have confirmed that the test results are positive according to the official plan.
As of March 23, the proportion of people surveyed in countries around the world does not exceed 3% of the total population, and many countries have issued official policies that do not detect light-sensitive people, including countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 showed that as of January 23, 86% of people infected with COVID-19 were undetected, with unrecorded infections being the source of 79% of recorded cases.
According to a statistical analysis released on March 30, Italy's actual number of infected people exceeded the number of reported cases.
The basic infectious numbers (R0) of COVID-19 were initially estimated between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study by the US Centers for Disease Control showed that R0 could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 can be rehabilitated.
Unrecoverable patients are most common from illness to death for a period of 6-41 days and 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 9.7 million people died of COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80 percent of deaths in China are in people over 60 years old, with 75 percent of deaths in combination with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics on COVID-19 deaths generally refer to those with a positive COVID-19 test result, according to an official program.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be far beyond statistical data because the data may not contain undetected patients, such as those who die at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic is 4-5 times the number of deaths from the official COVID-19 pandemic.
A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said: "We know that [publicly reported deaths] are lower than actual values, and rumors about U.S. data being underestimated have also confirmed the statement. Underestimating the occurrence of the 2009 H1N1 swine flu in the epidemic area is often occurring. On January 9, 2020, the first case in China was confirmed for death cases.
On February 1, the first case of death outside of China appeared in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first case of death outside of Asia appeared in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and regions across continents other than Antarctica reported deaths.
These figures vary from region to region, and are affected by population characteristics such as test volume, quality of health system, treatment program, time of the first outbreak of the epidemic, age, gender and overall health. The mortality rate is divided by the number of deaths within a given period of time to determine the number of patients.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The mortality rate in different regions is also different.
In China, the death rate estimate fell from 17.3% (1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (1 to 10 January 2020) (in patients with a condition after 1 February 2020). Some other measures also include the case death rate (CFR) and the rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of disease deaths as a percentage of the number of confirmed patients, which reflects the number of disease deaths as a percentage of infections (including those diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics have no time limit, and tracking is the entire process of solving a specific population from infection to case.
Many researchers have tried to calculate the above data for a specific group of people.
According to the Evidence-Based Medical Center of the University of Oxford, the overall mortality rate of infection is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimated value of this range is in line with the first random test conducted by Germany on COVID-19, and a statistical analysis study on the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says that the epidemic is controlled.
The peak of the outbreak and the final duration are not determined and vary by region.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University said: "If it is not controlled, the outbreak of communicable diseases usually enters the suspension period after the existing host is exhausted, and then begins to become accustomed to mitigation."
But it's almost impossible to predict when the crutches will appear."
Chen Nanshan, senior medical advisor to the Chinese government, said that if all countries are mobilized, the World Health Organization's recommendations on taking measures to stop the spread of the virus are expected to end the epidemic in June.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine, said the SARS-CoV-2 "may be repeated for two years."
A study conducted by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial College of Technology showed that it is necessary to maintain physical distance and other measures before the vaccine is put into use (it may take 18 months or longer).
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said: "This coronavirus is very infectious and I think it is unlikely to disappear completely," "may turn into a seasonal disease that explodes every year."
The re-emergence of the disease depends on the immune system and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific and some infected people may have no symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The most common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (sputum), loss of smell, stress, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, coldness, pimples, blood, diarrhea, diarrhea, or urination. According to the World Health Organization, about one-sixth of the patients turn to severe illness and have difficulty breathing.
The American Centers for Disease Control (CDC) lists breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden blurred consciousness, difficulty to soar, and redness of the face or lips as an emergency symptom; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately. The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hemorrhoids, infectious shocks and death.
Some infected people may have no symptoms, no clinical manifestations, but the test results are positive, so the researchers are advised to closely monitor and check closely with patients to eliminate the possibility of infection.
The percentage of people with no symptoms is estimated to range from very low to 44%.
The incubation period (time interval from infection to disease) is generally 1-14 days; the most common is 5 days. For uncertainty, it can be explained by an example: the proportion of patients who lost their sense of smell in COVID-19 was initially estimated to be 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Details on the path of transmission of the disease have not yet been determined.
At present, it is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted through near contact and when coughing, sneezing or speaking; near contact refers to an interval of 1-2 meters (3-6 feet).
Studies have found that unshakable coughs can cause the droplets to spread as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet) -8.2 meters (15-27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the droplets produced when people speak can also cause the spread of the virus for a longer period of time in the air. Although the virus usually cannot be transmitted through the air, people can also produce droplets when they breathe or speak.
This type of droplet can fall to the surrounding mouth and even inhaled in the lungs.
Medical procedures such as plugs and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause airborne transmission.
In addition, if a person touches the surface of the virus (including the skin), and then touches the mouth of the eye, it can also cause the virus to spread.
Some people are concerned that the virus may spread through urinary tract, but this risk is considered to be lower.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The virus was most contagious three days before the onset of the disease, but pre- and post-infection were also contagious.
A positive result can be detected as early as three days before the occurrence of the disease, indicating that the new coronavirus has been contagious before the occurrence of the obvious symptoms.
Despite the fact that the lab has been diagnosed with no symptoms, some countries have discovered symptoms of no symptoms during contact tracking surveys.
According to the European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC), although the spread of the new coronavirus is not yet fully clarified, one person in general can transmit 2-3 people. The virus survives on the surface of an object for several hours to a few days.
Specifically, the novel coronavirus is known to survive on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, one day on paper, and four hours on copper.
However, their survival time has also been affected by humidity and temperature, and there have been cases where pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can infect humans again, but the British authorities have advised people to wash their hands after contact with animals, just like other surfaces that could be touched by infected people.
SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that first separated from three pneumonia patients in a batch of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presented in nature-related coronaviruses. The virus can be extinguished with home soap before it enters the body, as soap can dissolve the protective membrane of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is currently treated as a human disease.
Genetic analysis shows that the coronavirus is genetically linked with the Î² coronavirus, which belongs to the Sarbecovirus family (B) and the two bat-source strains.
The coronavirus has 96% consistency with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that the virus in the pangolin body and the virus in the human body in certain parts of the genome sequence are only worse than one amino acid.
Up to now, the full genome comparison has found that up to 92% of the same genetic material between Pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is not enough to prove that Pangolin is an intermediate host.
Whether or not the virus is infected can be initially diagnosed according to the symptoms, but in the end, it is necessary to be diagnosed by the reversal polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretion.
A PCR vs. CT study conducted in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but with lower characteristics, many imaging features are reincorporated with other pneumonia and disease development processes.
As of March 2020, the American Academy of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used to diagnose COVID-19 or as the first test for the diagnosis of the disease."
The World Health Organization (WHO) has released several nucleic acid testing plans for SARS-CoV-2, the first on January 17.
nucleic acid testing uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Samples of respiratory tract or blood samples can be used for testing.
Results can be obtained in a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test can be done by nasopharyngeal swabs, and can also be done by nasopharyngeal swabs. Many laboratories and companies are developing serologic tests for testing antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, these testing methods have not been verified to be accurate enough and have not yet been approved for widespread use.
In the United States, serologic tests developed by Cellex have been approved and are used only in emergency situations by certified laboratories.
Typical imaging features of X-pieces and CT scans for patients with an illness include peripheral glass asymmetry and chestless volume fluids.
The Italian Academy of Radiology is developing an international online database for the visual performance of confirmed cases.
Due to reintegrate with other viral infections, such as adenovirus, images that have not been confirmed by PCR are limited in identifying the characteristics of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with the results of PCR, although the image for the identification of the characteristics of the infection is low, but the detection is faster and more sensitive, so it can be considered as a screening method in the pop area.
The AI-based convolutional neural network has been developed, which can be used in conjunction with X tablets and CTs to detect the image characteristics of the virus.
The measures to prevent the spread of diseases include good personal hygiene practices, hand washing, avoiding direct contact with the nose, coughing or sneezing, and using the towel to dispose of the trash.
People suspected of being infected should wear a medical surgical mask when entering public places.
It is also recommended to take physical distancing measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Many governments have restricted or recommended to avoid travel to and from countries and regions affected by the epidemic, where it is not necessary.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community, and some community residents never know where they are or how they are infected. Healthcare workers who are in contact with suspected infected people should take standard precautions, contact prevention measures and eye protection.
The government's use of mobile phone location data for tracking purposes has aroused concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations such as Amnesty International issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen team of experts are working on solutions with privacy protection features, such as the use of Bluetooth to record distance between users and other mobile phones.
Users who have been in close contact with people who have had a positive COVID-19 test result will receive a message reminder. Misconceptions about preventing infections continue to spread; such as washing their noses and mouthwashing is not valid.
There are currently no COVID-19 vaccines, but many organizations are actively developing them.
It is recommended to prevent the spread of diseases by hand washing.
The Centers for Disease Control recommend that people wash their hands frequently with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after washing their hands, before meals, and after nasal sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because the virus can destroy its protective cyst before entering the human body by using only home soap to destroy the cysts.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that alcohol-free hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol can be used without soap and free water nearby.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
The surface of the object can be disinfected with a variety of solutions (the disinfectant can take effect within one minute of the stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% hypochlorite sodium chloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyvinyl ketone iodine.
Other solutions such as benzene chloride and chloride Gluconate are less effective.
The Centers for Disease Control recommends that if there are suspected cases or confirmed cases of COVID-19 at facilities such as offices or daycares, sterilize all areas, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, and automatic money machines used by patients.
The Health Organization recommends that people sneeze their noses with sneezing elbows or tissues while coughing or sneezing, and immediately dispose of all contaminated tissues.
It is recommended that patients with suspected infection wear a medical surgical mask because wearing a mask can reduce the amount of droplets that are called when speaking, sneezing and coughing and shorten the transmission distance.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published instructions on the use of masks and how to use them.
Dr. Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, said, "The wearing of a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, and in the absence of hand hygiene, it is also a great source of infection."
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for taking care of patients with COVID-19, but the organization also recognizes that wearing a mask can help avoid touching their face.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage general public to wear masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China has made it clear that healthy citizens should also wear disposable medical masks, especially if they are in close contact with others within (1 m (3 ft).
Hong Kong, China recommends wearing a mask when travelling by public transport or entering crowded places.
Thai health officials recommend people to self-manage masks and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are strictly prohibited from wearing masks or covering their noses in public places.
On March 16, Vietnam required all people to wear masks in order to enter public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government states that all people are required to wear a mask when entering a grocery store.
Israel requires all residents to wear masks on public occasions.
China has produced 10 million masks since mid-March, and on April 1, it will require masks to be worn by trains and intercity buses.
Panama regulations must wear a mask on the go, and it is recommended that residents who do not buy a mask are self-made masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Infection prevention and control measures to maintain social distancing (also known as physical distancing) are designed to minimize close contact between people and thereby reduce the spread of disease.
Measures include isolation; travel restrictions; school closures, closures, and closures of sports venues, theaters, or shopping centers.
When it comes to social distancing, individual measures can be taken to stay at home, limit travel, avoid entering crowded areas, switch to contactless greetings, and maintain physical distance from others.
Many governments are now required or recommended to maintain social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The initial recommendation of the U.S. government agencies and health organizations for the largest population gathering was 250 people (in areas where there was no COVID-19 transmission), which quickly decreased to 50 and then to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned more than two people from public assemblies. Seniors and groups with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure and immune system damage are at higher risk for serious illness and complications. The German Centers for Disease Control recommend that such people living in the epidemic area as far as possible not go out. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organizations began to use "keep physical distance" instead of "keep social distance" to clarify its purpose to reduce physical contact, while still maintaining social connections, including virtual and remote connections.
The use of the word "keep social distance" has the meaning of requiring people to be completely isolated from society, without encouraging people to use other ways to maintain a connection between people and people. Some authorities have also published guidelines for sexual health during the pandemic.
The recommendations include sexual relationships with a partner who lives alone and is not infected with a virus or symptom-free.
COVID-19 is recommended for self-isolation at homes of patients and suspected infected individuals.
Health authorities have issued a detailed statement on correct self-isolation, many governments have forced or recommended self-isolation for all residents of the epidemic area.
In addition, the strictest self-isolation instructions were issued to high-risk populations.
Countries or regions that are likely to have been exposed to COVID-19, or have recently been exposed to the virus, are recommended to self-isolate for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Pandemic prevention and control strategies include containment/suppression and mitigation.
The aim is to track and segregate infected people in the early stages of the outbreak, while taking other infection prevention and control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to other people.
If it is no longer possible to curb the spread of the disease, it is necessary to take steps to reduce the spread of the disease and reduce the impact of the disease on the health system and society.
Control and mitigation measures can be carried out at the same time.
Suppression needs to take more extreme control measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic regenerations to below 1. Part of the work to control the outbreak of communicable diseases is to strive to reduce the peak of the epidemic, that is, the raping epidemic curve as we know it.
This reduces the risk of collapse in the health services system and seeks more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programs.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that control the epidemic include personal preventive measures such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-isolation; community measures designed to maintain physical distances such as discontinuation and cancellation of mass gatherings; community actions designed to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries and regions have also taken measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced large-scale screening and local isolation measures, and issued a warning on the activity track of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for individuals with self-isolation and provides substantial penalties for those who refuse to self-isolate.
China and Taiwan have increased mask production and imposed punishment on medical supplies suppliers selling goods. Simulated for the United Kingdom and the United States shows that mitigation (remitting but not preventing the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (twiping the spread of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
The best mitigation policy may reduce peak medical demand by 2/3, halve the number of deaths, but it will still lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of people, causing the health system to collapse.
Suppression may be a preferred measure, but it is necessary to keep the virus in the population to stop the spread (or until the vaccine is launched, whichever comes first), otherwise, once the relaxation measures, the spread will quickly bounce back.
Long-term interventions aimed at suppressing the pandemic will lead to social and economic costs.
No special effects antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19 yet, but research and development work is ongoing, including trials of existing drugs.
Taking non-prescription drugs, supplements, and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and breathing support may be required.
The use of steroids may lead to deterioration.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied to determine if they are applicable to the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also noted that some "traditional and family therapy" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
According to the World Health Organization, improving treatment capacity and adjusting medical systems to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic response to the pandemic.
ECDC and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization published guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for transferring resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating selective procedures, separating and segregating COVID-19 positive patients as much as possible, and improving critical care capacity by training staff and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
Guessing people about the origin of the first case (i.e., a patient with zero).
The first known case of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be traced back to December 1, 2019, in Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of new coronavirus cases in Hubei province has increased.
Most of these patients are related to the wholesale market of South China Sea, the market also sell live animals, a theory that the novel coronavirus is derived from one of these animals; or in other words, it originates from the human animal common disease. On December 26, the doctor of Hubei Zhongxi Medical Combined Hospital first discovered and cured a group of unexplained pneumonia patients, and on December 27 reported to the Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Center in Wuhan City.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital reminded their colleagues to be vigilant of an SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight doctors, including Wen-Liang Li, were trained by the police because of the spread of rumors, while the other doctor, Ephen, was trained by the police by the Rally Alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued an announcement on December 31 and reported it to the World Health Organization.
After receiving numerous unexplained cases of pneumonia from the Wuhan Department of Health, a survey was launched in early January. In the early days of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about every seven days and half.
From early January to mid January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, affected by the Chinese Spring Festival crowds and Wuhan as traffic hubs and major rail hubs.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including 2 cases in Beijing and 1 case in Shenzhen.
As of March 26, 2020, U.S. confirmed cases exceeded China and Italy, becoming the most confirmed case country in the world. As of April 9, 2020, the cumulative global reported cases exceeded 161 million; more than 9.7 million deaths cured more than 36.64 million cases.
In approximately 200 countries and regions worldwide, there are reports of confirmed cases.
Due to the influence of the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area have adopted measures to limit the free flow of people and establish border control.

On February 24, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside of mainland China.
On February 27, the public's concerns about the novel coronavirus outbreak have increased, including the Nasdaq 100 Index, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have seen the largest drop since 2008, representing a drop of 1,191 points, the largest single-day drop since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
The three major indexes have declined by more than 10% each week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH recognized China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative outlook.
The public's concern about the new coronavirus caused the stock market to plummet again, with the largest drop on March 16.
Many believe that economic recession is a high-risk event.
The Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the central banks and states for taking timely and urgent measures.
The central bank response was faster compared to the 2008 financial crisis.
The closure of public places such as travel bans, tourist attractions, and the government's recommendations to avoid the impact of travel, tourism has become one of the most affected industries.
Many airlines have cancelled flights due to a decline in demand, including British Airways, Eastern Airlines of China, and Qantas, while British Airways Flybe is unfortunately closed.
The shipping industry has never been more challenging.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic just happened during the spring season, because of China's spring holiday, it was originally an important tourist season.
The state and local governments have cancelled a series of activities that will involve crowd gatherings, including the annual Spring Festival, and private companies have also shut down their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disney Parks.
Many New Year activities and tourist attractions, including the Beijing Palace and traditional temples, are cancelled and closed to prevent mass gatherings.
Among the 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China, 24 regions extend the New Year holiday to February 10, requiring most businesses not to return to work before that date.
The total GDP of these regions accounts for 80% of the country and 90% of the exports.
Hong Kong, China will raise infectious diseases to the highest level, and announce the entry into the emergency state, school closures until March, New Year's celebration canceled. Retail industry is affected by the global, shop opening hours shortened or temporary closure.
Retail stores in Europe and Latin America have declined by 40%.
Retail stores in North America and the Middle East declined 50-60%.
In addition, the pandemic has resulted in a 33-43% drop in traffic in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world have taken additional measures, such as increasing health facilities, installing a heat scanner to measure the temperature of shoppers, and canceling some activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the economic recession caused by the pandemic could lead to an increase in extreme poverty in Latin America by 14 million to 20 million.
In January and February 2020, at the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about five million people were unemployed in China.
In March 2020, more than 10 million U.S. workers were unemployed and applied for government assistance.
According to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's estimates, the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to 4,7 million unemployed people in the U.S., with unemployment rates likely reaching 32%. India's lockdown has caused millions (daily pay) of Indian farmers to be unemployed. Angesrid Research Institute found that 44% of Canadian families experienced some form of unemployment.
In the second half of March, four million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and one million British workers applied for general welfare benefits.
Both France and the United Kingdom have adopted the German time-lapse compensation scheme.
The arts and culture industry has also been heavily affected by the pandemic, and the global organisation and the employees and individuals who are employed have not been spared.
The Organisation for the Arts and Cultural Industries is committed to upholding its mission (usually funded by the government) to demonstrate cultural heritage to the community, safeguard the safety of its employees and the public, and provide support to artists as much as possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, performing venues and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and original exhibitions, events and performances were forced to be cancelled or deferred.
In response to this situation, the parties began to vigorously provide alternative services through the digital platform. The recent outbreak will also cause many religious services, major sports activities and other social activities (such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows) to be forced to cancel, and the negative impact will be rapidly increasing.
The film industry was equally affected. Vatican announced the cancellation of the Christmas commemoration event to be held in Rome at the last week of Christian Pentecost.
Many parishes recommend that older Christians stay at home, and there is no need to participate in the Mass on Sundays; some churches hold worship ceremonies via radio, live online or television, and some churches allow in-car worship.
Due to the close of the Roman Catholic Diocese, there are no Christian pilgrims on St. Peter's Square. Other religious groups have also cancelled or restricted the worship or limited public gatherings at churches, mosques, Jewish churches, temples and priests.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the pandemic, and it was forced to close the holy place later, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the world's sports schedule to be the most devastating damage since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or postponed, including 2019-20 Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, 2020 Champions League, 2019-20 NBA Season and 2019-20 All-State Hockey League Season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics scheduled to take place at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would "reschedule after 2020 but not later than summer 2021". Casinos and other casinos around the world were closed, and live poker games were forced to be postponed or cancelled.
As a result, many gamblers turn to online gambling, multiple online gambling website reports that their new registration rate has increased significantly. Recreation industry has also been affected, various music groups have suspended or canceled the tour.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway Theatre, have also suspended all performances.
Some artists also try to continue to create and share works through the Internet in order to replace traditional live performances, such as live concerts, or create web "holidays" for artists to perform, publish and promote their works.
On the Internet, many Internet fans with the theme of the new coronavirus spread open, in the moment of uncertainty, many people began to turn to humor and transfer attention in a humorous way.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, prejudice, xenophobia, and racial discrimination against Chinese, Eastern Asian, and people from Europe, the United States, and other countries have increased.
Many countries and regions, especially Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia Pacific, have experienced fear, doubt, and hatred.
In February of this year, many reports (most of the cases were still limited to China at that time) recorded the racist sentiments expressed by different groups of people around the world about Chinese people, and believed that Chinese people should be infected with the virus or accept the so-called justifiable retaliation.
There has also been an increase in anti-African sentiment.
According to reports, many residents in Wuhan and Hubei regions have been subjected to geographical discrimination.
Both online and offline, there is a voice that supports Chinese people and people in areas with severe epidemics.
With the spread of the pandemic to other hot countries, Italy became Europe's first COVID-19 outbreak, and people from that country may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobic psychology. Some citizens from Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and other countries initially signed a petition to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to stop the spread of disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan (Chinese people come to Japan) topic is widely spread.
The Chinese, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported an increasing number of racist abuses and attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump is criticizing the novel coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" and critics believe that his statements have racism and anti-Chinese tendencies.
The Ukrainian protesters attacked a bus from Wuhan to New Sanzary with Ukrainian and foreign evacuators.
Students from northeast India (connected with China) and major cities in India have also been harassed by the outbreak of the new coronavirus.
Dilipp Gosh, President of the Indian People's Party West Bengal, said the Chinese were devastated by nature, "So God will punish them."
These statements have later been criticised by Chinese consulates in Kolkata, known as their "errors". In China, non-Chinese residents are affected by xenophobic psychology and racism due to the pandemic, and foreigners are described as "foreign trash" and should be the target of "waste disposal."
Many newspapers with paidwalls have removed the paidwall limits for some or all reports on the novel coronavirus.
A number of scientific publishers have published a number of scientific papers related to the epidemic.
Scientists have also chosen to quickly share their research results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Wild animal smuggling and animal coexistence: health risks associated with the sale of exotic wildlife
2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus laboratory testing methods include: to detect the presence of the virus and to detect whether antibodies are produced after infection.
RT-PCR detects the RNA of the coronavirus and determines whether there is a virus in the sample.
This is a characteristic test for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It can be used to determine whether or not you have recently been infected or have an active infection.
Antibody testing (Sensor tests) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with mild symptoms that do not report or have no symptoms.
The results of this test determine the exact death rate of the disease and the level of population immunity in the population.
Due to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country/region has been able to provide reliable data on the epidemic situation of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country has detected more than 3% of its population, and the number of tests performed in each country is significantly different.
This difference can also significantly affect the mortality rate of cases reported in some countries, which can be highly overestimated.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing using pharynx swabs can only be completed within the first week after infection, to obtain reliable results.
Results are generally available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests conducted by pharynx swabs can only be completed within the first week of infection, and can be reliable results.
After that, the virus disappeared in the throat, but the lungs continued to breed.
For infected persons who have been tested in the second week after infection, the sample can be replaced with a deep breathing extract obtained through the suction tube, or the cough (sputum) can be used.
In January 2020, RRRT-PCR was released at CharitÃ© Hospital in Berlin, one of the early PCR testing methods and became the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 23, 2020, the UK also developed a test method. On January 28, 2020, Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-based PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It is looking for all the "E" genes common to the Î² coronavirus, as well as the unique RdRp genes unique to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to obtain emergency approvals for the production of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has distributed the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostics panel to public health laboratories through the International Laboratory of Drug Resources.
The early versions of the tester box adopted three genetic testing methods, one of which was unable to determine the results due to a defect in reagents, and at the same time, the Atlanta CDC showed a test bottle; which resulted in the whole of February 2020, the average number of samples successfully processed per day was less than 100.
Contain two parts of the testing until February 28, 2020, which is considered reliable, at which point the state and local laboratories are allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the emergency use authorization. The U.S. Commercial Laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp announced that it will be able to conduct national RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing as of March 5, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics also announced the availability of nationwide COVID-19 testing as of March 9, 2020.
No number limit has been announced; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing is developed and produced by the National Center for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Federal Health Administration in Russia. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic developed a reagent box that could detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics' one test method was approved by the FDA, which can be tested in bulk within 3.5 hours, enabling a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued Abbott Laboratories an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott's m2000 system for testing. The FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, one of Cepheid's tests that took about 45 minutes to get the FDA's emergency use authorization.
The FDA has approved the use of temperature expansion technologies such as nucleic acid in place of PCR testing.
Since this method does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, a positive result can be obtained in just 5 minutes and a negative result can be determined in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 devices in the U.S., and Abbott is expected to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a testing method that uses monoclonal antibodies (specifically in combination with novel coronavirus nuclear casing proteins (N proteins)), hoping to provide testing results in 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 paper summed up such conclusions, "In the early stages of the virus, the diagnosis of chests is small, and CT [computerized scan] performance may be very evident, even before the symptoms appear"
Typical features of CT include dual-pulmonary multi-ferrous glass mirrors with peripheral asymmetry and rear part cloths.
As the disease progresses, there will be significant signs of the chest membrane, rocky track and lung changes.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan (the place where the initial outbreak of the current pandemic started) showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, but CT's accuracy was lower, and its many imagery features were associated with other pneumonia and disease hemorrhoids.
As of March 2020, the American Academy of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used for screening for COVID-19 or as a first-line testing tool for diagnostic COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC recommends using PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to the infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about 7 days after the start of symptoms to determine the immune status of the monitored population. They can be determined in the center laboratory (CLT) or through real-time testing (PoCT).
Many high-throughput automated systems in clinical laboratories can be identified above, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, although an immune response can be tracked through sequence samples, it is usually determined using an external blood sample.
For PoCT, skin piercing is generally used to obtain a blood sample.
There is no need to perform extraction steps before the determination, which is different from the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the test methods of 29 entity declarations, which are now able to distribute their antibody test kits.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA approved only one test according to emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the Omron Medical Laboratory Diagnostics Corp. and Epitope Diagnostics test kits were approved in Europe, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
Hundreds of samples can be detected in a matter of hours, so on virus RNAs, it is much faster than conventional PCRs.
In general, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the UK found that in the antibody test kit it purchased, there was not enough use.
Hong Kong has established a mechanism for suspected patients to be able to stay home, "the emergency room provides samples of test tubes to patients", the patient spits the saliva to the test tube, and then sends the test tube back to the test tube, and will receive the results later. The UK NHS announced that it was testing a plan for suspected cases at home, so that it can eliminate the risk of infection to others when the patient goes to the hospital, and the patient must sanitize the ambulance after using the ambulance.
In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that non-hospitals had the ability to perform approximately 12,000 tests per day and have tested 10,700 times in the last week.
If a medical examination is required, the cost of health insurance will be borne.
Director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany said Germany had 160,000 weekly total testing capabilities.
As of March 19, unmanned vehicle inspections have been provided in many major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of testers conducted in Germany is unknown, as only the number of people reported as positive.
A preliminary lab survey showed that as of week 12, 2020, at least 483,295 samples (including those within the 12-week 2020) were detected, with 33,491 SARS-CoV-2 positive. Researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and tested a method for simultaneous testing of 64 patient samples, i.e. aggregated samples, and only further tests were performed when the combined samples were found to be positive.
The laboratory was built in 5 days under the supervision of Wang Jian, the founder of China's genes, and the model showed that if the above test capability was not achieved, the Hubei case would be 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment isolation costs would double.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately followed the establishment of the fire eye laboratory, and currently in 12 cities in China to establish the laboratory.
As of March 4, 2020, the total number of daily laboratory tests is 50,000. The Origami Assays release of open-source, multi-route design allows COVID19 testing of up to 1122 patient samples only through 93 tests.
As of March, the shortage and shortage of reagents has become a barrier to large-scale testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some promoters to explore sample preparation programs that involved heating the sample to 98Â°C (208 Â°F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on March 31 that it has now tested more people with COVID-19 than any other country and is expanding the testing level to allow a large number of people to be tested.
The way to achieve this test capability is to use a drive-through test on the one hand, and to build a high-throughput laboratory to meet the testing needs of large-scale populations with Group 42 and HuaDa (based on its "fire eye" emergency testing laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, the world's first such large-scale laboratory operating outside of China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different testing methods for various parts of the coronavirus gene spectrum.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German method of testing and testing kits to send kits for low-income countries without resources to develop their own kits.
Germany's approach was published on January 17, 2020; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) program was available after January 28, limiting the ability to test the United States. China and the United States were facing test kit reliability early in the outbreak, and both countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient test kits to meet testing recommendations from demand and health experts.
On the contrary, experts believe that extensive testing in South Korea is very helpful in reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Thanks to the testing capabilities established by the Korean government in the past few years, it is mainly concentrated in the private sector laboratory.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to reduce the development of the COVID-19 pandemic. The widespread spread of the virus has resulted in a very large demand for testing, which has caused thousands of private laboratories in the United States to be tested, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents has become tense.
In March 2020, China reported the accuracy of its test kit.
In the United States, the CDC-developed test kit has a "defect"; subsequently, the government eliminates the bureaucratic barriers that hinder the detection of private laboratories. Spain purchased the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Yirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd., and found the test results are inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect test results may be caused by incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of test kits.
The Spanish Cabinet said that the return of the wrong test kits was replaced with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China were incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, and the results were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister MatoviÄ suggested that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. AteÅ Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said Turkey bought the test boxes from China "high error rate" and did not "use them."
Conduct testing and isolate people with positive test results and track the contact history of SARS-CoV-2 positive people to achieve positive results.
Researchers working in the city of VÃ², Italy, the first COVID-19 patient death site in Italy, tested a total of about 3,400 people in two rounds, each separated for about ten days.
About half of them have detected positive and no symptoms, and all reported cases have been isolated.
By taking travel restrictions on the community, it completely eliminates new infections.
With large-scale tracking of contacts, restricting inbound travel, testing and isolation, the 2020 coronavirus infection in Singapore is far slower than in other developed countries, and Singapore does not take extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail locations.
Singapore has canceled many activities, and on March 28, residents are recommended to stay at home, but the school resumes after the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries, such as Ireland and South Korea, have also controlled the spread of disease through large-scale tracking of contacts, restricted inbound travel, detection and isolation, and less aggressive lockdowns.
A statistical study found that compared to the number of deaths, the more the number of detection countries, the lower the mortality rate of their cases, the reasons may be that these countries can better detect only minor symptoms or symptom-free groups.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries with limited experience in handling COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 World Health Organization laboratories for verification testing.
Of the 16 laboratories, 7 were in Asia, 5 were in Europe, 2 were in Africa, 1 was in North America, and 1 was in Australia.
In the chart below, the "Detect positive %" column is affected by the country's testing policy.
In the same situation as in other conditions, the country where all citizens are detected (whether or not symptoms appear), only the inpatients are detected, whose positive detection rate is higher.
Hand washing, also known as hand washing, is to clean the hands by removing dust, grease, microorganisms or other useless substances.
Hand washing with soap prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and choke, in certain âcritical momentsâ every day.
If people do not wash their hands before touching their own eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common cold.
Wash your hands with soap five key moments in a day: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's hips or changing nappies, before and after feeding the child, before and after meals, or before or after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with grassy grays. The World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands in the following situations:
Before, during and after food preparation.
Care for the patient before and after.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the hips of children.
After rubbing nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food or animal.
Medical staff hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before delivery or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may harm the human body or cause disease.
Hand washing is especially important for people who work in the field of food processing or healthcare, but it is also very important for the general public to practice hand washing.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing contagious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality rate of infants at home.
A 2013 study showed that improving hand washing practices has a slightly contributing effect on the height of children under five.
In developing Chinese families, by promoting simple behavioral changes (e.g. hand washing with soap), the mortality rate of children related to respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced.
This simple behavior can reduce the mortality rate of the above diseases by nearly 50%.
advocating hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about one-third, which is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap reduces the incidence of diarrhoea by 48%. As self-released in homes, schools and communities around the world, hand washing with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
As a major acute respiratory infection, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five, and pneumonia takes the lives of about 1.8 million children each year.
A total of nearly 3.5 million children die per year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children's Foundation said that using soap to wash hands before and after meals can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, reducing the death caused by diarrhea by nearly half, and reducing the death caused by acute respiratory infection by a quarter.
As part of the water supply, environmental hygiene and personal hygiene (WASH) program, other health interventions are usually taken while advocating hand washing.
Handwashing can also prevent leukemia that can be transmitted through direct physical contact.
Handwashing can have a slight adverse effect, i.e. frequent hand washing can cause dry skin, which can cause skin damage.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand washing could cause skin irritation, fracture, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among medical staff.
Excessive hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive disorder (OCD).
In order to reduce the spread of disease, it is important to wash your hands with soap five key moments in the day: after the toilet (urinating, urinating), after cleaning the child's hips (replacement of nappies), before and after feeding the child, before and after meals, before and after handling food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
In order to prevent the spread of disease, wash your hands the right way in the following cases: before or after the incision or wound; after spraying, coughing or rubbing; after touching an animal's mouth or handling an animal; and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is low.
In 2015, a study of 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households use soap to wash their hands. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has reached 97%; the United States has reached an average of 77%; the United States has reached a minimum of 77%; China has a minimum of 23%.
The Philippines Ministry of Education's "Basic Health Care Program" is a model for taking large-scale initiatives to improve children's health and education.
At the heart of this national plan is to smear twice a year, with daily hand washing with soap and brushing with fluoride toothpaste.
The project has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Infuse in water with soap or detergent to better remove microorganisms from the skin.
The main role of soap and detergent is to reduce dissolving barriers and improve solubleity.
Only using water does not effectively clean the skin as fats and proteins (parts of organic soil) are not easily dissolved in water.
However, cleaning your hand sanitizer requires reasonable water...
Solid soaps can be reused, and bacteria that have been left in the past may be stored.
A small number of studies have investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap. The conclusion is that bacteria cannot be transferred because it will be washed away by bubbles.
But the CDC still claims that it is best to use contactless liquid soap.
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted in the public with a good sense of health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antimicrobials or disinfectants has selected antibiotic resistant microorganisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as trichloride sand, and trichloride sands have a large number of resistant microorganisms strain.
Therefore, even if the antibacterial soap is not selected for the antibiotic resistant strain, the antibacterial soap may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to surfactants and skin care agents, complex formulations may also contain acids (acetic acids, antibacterial acids, lactic acids), antibacterial active benzoic acids, and many more skin modifiers (anxiety, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the Oregon University of Public Health has shown that in terms of preventing disease and removing bacteria from hand, ordinary soaps are the same effect as consumer grade antibacterial soaps containing trichlorosap.
Hot water is very comfortable to wash your hands, but its heat is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow quickly at body temperature (37 Â°C).
However, when removing natural oils containing soil and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water.
Scientific research has confirmed that using warm water has no effect on reducing microorganisms in hand, which is contrary to the general view.
A water-free hand sanitizer or antibacterial hand sanitizer is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late twentieth and early twentieth centuries, non-water-based hand sanitizers (also known as hand sanitizers, antibacterial hand sanitizers or hand sanitizers) were popular.
Most of these hand sanitizer formulas contain acetyl alcohol or ethanol, and then add thickeners such as Capom (acrylic polymer) to form a gel, or add a humidifier such as glycerin to form a liquid, or foam for ease of use, and reduce the drying of the skin caused by alcohol.
Hydrogen peroxide added after dilution can further increase antibacterial activity. At least 60% to 95% alcohol-free hand sanitizer can effectively sterilize.
Alcohol hand sanitizer kills bacteria, multi-pharmaceutical resistant bacteria (MRSA-resistant) and antimicrobial bacillus (VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), nasal virus, pox, influenza and hepatitis) as well as fungi.
70% alcohol-based hand sanitizer kills 99.97% of the bacteria in your hand (less than 3.5 levels, similar to 35 decibels), and 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 levels) after 1 minute of hand sanitizer.
Alcohol hand sanitizer is almost ineffective against viruses like the NOROvirus (also known as the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal arthritis) such as the Norwalk virus. It is necessary to use sufficient antibacterial hand sanitizer or alcohol hand sanitizer to completely wet or cover your hands.
Rub the hand and back of the hand and between the fingers and at the end of all fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingers must also be thoroughly cleaned and hand sanitized in both palms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that it is best to wash your hands instead of using hand sanitizer, especially when your hands look dirty.
Since these hand rubs are easy to use and can quickly cause the microorganisms to lose their activity, they are increasingly being used; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-free hand sanitizer can cause dry skin, unless the formula has been added to the moisturiser and/or moisturiser.
Add glycerin and/or other moisturisers to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying of the skin caused by alcohol.
In clinical trials, alcohol-free hand sanitizer containing botanicals can significantly reduce skin irritation and dryness compared to soap or antibacterial cleaners.
Sensitivity to dermatitis, contact measles syndrome or allergies to additives in alcohol or hand sanitizer is rare.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizer is less likely to cause irritable contact with dermatitis than hand washing with soap and water, which is one of the reasons why it is attractive.
Although water-free cleaners are effective, they do not remove the organic matter from the hand, just disinfect it.
As a result, hands-free hand sanitizer is less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens than soap and water, as these pathogens are still in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer largely depends on the ingredients and formulas, which have always been much more effective than alcohol and hand sanitizer.
Recently, the formula for using benzene chloride has been confirmed to have a continuous, cumulative antibacterial activity after use, which is different from alcohol, alcohol has been confirmed to reduce the effect after repeated use, may be due to the gradual cause of adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap and can use grass ash or soil instead.
It is better to wash your hands with grass ash or soil than using water alone, but not soap.
One of the problems is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may accelerate the spread of disease rather than slowing the spread.
Like soap, grass ash is also a disinfectant, because it will form an alkaline solution after water.
WHO recommends that if soap is not available, soap can be substituted with turquoise ash or sand.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the correct way to wash hands to prevent the spread of diseases is as follows:
Humidify your hands with flowing warm water or cool water.
It is recommended to use water because the vertical basin may be contaminated, and the water temperature does not seem to be related.
Use plenty of soap to rub repeatedly to create foam while washing the back of the hand, between fingers and nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies have shown that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when washing their hands with soap instead of using water alone.
Wash for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing results in friction, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, the longer the time it is rubbed, and the more bacteria it is removed.
Clean thoroughly with water.
Hand washing in the basins can cause re-contamination.
Wipe dry or dry naturally with a clean towel.
Wet hands are more prone to recontamination. Thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and nails are the most overlooked areas.
Artificial nails and cracked nails may hide microbes.
It is usually recommended to use moisturizing lotion to avoid dry hands. Dry skin can cause skin damage, thus increasing the risk of infection.
In the case of limited water supply (e.g., developing schools or rural areas in China), water-saving hand washing solutions can be used, such as simple taps and other low-cost methods.
The technique is simple, hang a water tank with a rope, then pour a small amount of water into your hand through a foot pedal, then use soap.
Effective handwashing is an important step in the process of handwashing, but there are still some debates on the most effective handwashing methods among public health.
More and more studies have shown that tissues are healthier than electric dry cell phones provided by many health care providers.
In 2008, the University of Westminster conducted a research sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium in the paper towel industry, comparing paper towels, warm cell phones, and more modern jet-type dry cell phones.
After hand washing, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by 194% and the total number of bacteria on the palms increased by 254%.
The total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by 42% and the total number of bacteria on the palms increased by 15%.
After hand washing, the total amount of bacteria on the fingers is reduced by 76% on average, and the total amount of palm bacteria is reduced by 77% on average. Scientists have also conducted various tests to determine whether various methods of handwashing can cause cross infections among other health users and health facilities.
It is said that the jet-type dry cell phone sprayed the air at 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h) and was able to blow away the microorganisms on the hands and body, which could pollute other health users and health facilities within 2 meters.
Using a warm-air dry cell phone can transmit microorganisms to places other than the dry cell phone 0.25 meters.
The results of the use of hand sanitizer showed that there would be no serious microbial transmission. In 2005, TÃV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess the different methods of hand sanitizer.
The following changes have been observed in the number of bacteria:
The study was conducted by a number of different handset manufacturers, comparing these handsets with handhelds.
During the trip, you can choose to wash your hands with hand sanitizer wipes without soap and water.
The alcohol content of alcohol-free hand sanitizer should be at least 60%.
Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered that hand washing was effective in preventing the spread of diseases in hospitals in 1846, however, a long time later, it was mandatory for medical personnel to wash their hands.
The hospital uses electronic devices that provide feedback to alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found that infection rates decreased after using these devices.
Physicians wash their hands for at least 15 seconds and use adequate amounts of soap and water or gel when washing their hands to produce foam and rub off all parts of their hands.
Hands are rubbed against each other.
If there is a residue between the nails, it can be removed with a hard brush.
As there may still be bacteria in the remaining moisture in the hands, it is necessary to thoroughly clean and dry with a clean towel.
After dry, use a towel to close the tap (use a towel to open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands due to contact with these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogen microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid transmission.
The report in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that in most medical settings, hand washing still does not reach an acceptable level, and a large number of medical staff often forget to wash their hands before touching patients, leading to the spread of microorganisms.
A study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the blood flow rate associated with tubes by 66%. The World Health Organization published a worksheet demonstrating the standard method of hand washing and rubbing in medical institutions.
The organization has also published a draft Hand Health Guide on its website for public opinion.
Whitby and others have made a similar statement.
If compliance is required, commercial equipment can be measured and validated for hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization recommends "five moments" of hand washing:
After contact with blood/body fluid
Before and after aseptic operation and
After taking care of the patient, adding antibacterial chemicals to the soap ("poison" or "antibacterial soap") can cause the bactericidal effect of hand sanitizer.
This type of sterilization operation may be required in an environment where there is a large amount of antibiotic resistant microorganisms before or after surgery. In order to do the operation and "wash" the hands, there must be a water dragon head that can be opened and closed without contact, a chlorinated or iodine-based hand sanitizer, a sterile towel for dry hands after hand washing, a sterile brush for cleaning and other sterile tools for cleaning nail sticks.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands, forearms, until the elbow, usually 2â6 minutes.
It does not require long cleaning (10 minutes).
When rinsing, it is necessary to prevent the water from flowing back into the front arm.
After washing your hands, use aseptic cloth to dry your hands and wear surgical clothing.
In order to reduce the spread of bacteria, it is best to wash your hands or use a wash-free hand sanitizer before and after contact with the patient.
In order to control the bacterial infections in the hospital, it is found that the maximum benefit of cleaning hands is limited when the frequency of washing hands reaches 20%, when the frequency of cleaning hands is increased to more than 35%.
Handwashing with regular soap causes more than three times the proportion of bacterial infections that are transmitted to food than using antibacterial soap. After handwashing with alcohol is compared with handwashing with antibacterial soap (30 seconds respectively), it is found that the proportion of infections with handwashing with alcohol is 26% lower than with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizer for reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and the Clostridium difficile spores. It can improve the hand hygiene of medical institutions by training employees to wash their hands, increase the supply of alcohol hand sanitizer, and provide written and oral reminders to employees.
Further research is needed for which interventions are most effective in a variety of medical settings.
Hand washing with soap is considered as a cost-effective tool to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces has made widespread hand washing a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even if there is a cheap way to build a hand sanitizer, it is very rare to have a hand sanitizer near each private toilet or public toilet.
However, the low frequency of hand washing can also be a deep-rooted habit, not because of the lack of soap or water.
The promotion and promotion of the use of soap hand washing can affect policy formulation, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavior changes in residents.
In order to be effective, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
Through systematic evaluation of 70 studies, it was found that in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to increase the proportion of hand washing, the community-based methods are effective, and social marketing activities are less effective. One example of the advocacy of hand washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Foundation for the implementation of the " Samsung Method", in addition to other health requirements, schools are encouraged to take simple, cheap measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum level is reached, the school can rise from one star to the highest of three stars.
Hand-washing activities can include building a hand sanitizer to reduce disease and mortality among children.
Another example of raising awareness of hand washing is World Handwashing Day with the aim of trying to achieve behavioral changes. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF promotes the use of a handwashing emoji.
There is very little study on the relationship between the total cost-effectiveness of hand washing and the age of disability adjustment (DALY) in developing Chinese households.
However, reports show that the cost-effectiveness of advocating hand washing with soap is more significant than other water and sanitation interventions.
The first to recognize the importance of handwashing to human health - especially for those who are physically weak (for example, a mother or wounded soldier who was just born in a hospital) - is a pioneer in the mid 19th century two hand health fields: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the UK's founder of modern nursing care.
At that time, most people still thought that the infection was caused by a bad odor known as a venomous odor.
The outbreak of food-borne diseases in the twentieth century and medically-infected, prompting the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively advocate hand hygiene, emphasizing that hand hygiene is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of the 2009 swine flu and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have made many countries more aware of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.
For example, Germany hangs the "correct hand washing method" poster next to the toilets in public health, office building, and airport hygiene.
The term "hand washing is not done" means that a person declares that he is not willing to take responsibility for something or not willing to take part in something.
It derives from the content in the Gospel of Matthew, and Pontius Pilate washes his hands after deciding to bury Jesus, and later becomes widely used in some English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare's McBean, Mrs. McBean began forced handwashing in attempts to clean the dirt in her imagination, suggesting that she felt guilty for her crimes and forcibly committed her husband's crimes.
Research shows that people who think or think about unethical behavior tend to wash their hands more often than others, and often cherish the washing facilities more often.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after thinking about unethical behavior, it is less likely to engage in other "cleaning" compensation actions, such as volunteering.
Religion requires hand sanitizer for health and symbolism. The symbolic hand sanitizer that washes hands with water but does not use soap is part of many religious symbols, including the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith, Hinduism, the bath-style (tevilah) and the netilat yadayim, the clean hand sanitizer in Christianity and the cleanness in Islam.
Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic mandates to wash their hands after a toilet.
Wash hands before and after meals are required by Hindus, Buddhism, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam.
COVID-19 prevention in the workplace
COVID-19 workplace prevention and control refers to the use of occupational safety and health measures to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Whether risk control in the workplace is appropriate depends on the specific workplace and work tasks, and should be decided based on risk assessment of exposure sources, severity of community diseases, and risk factors that may come into contact with individuals who are susceptible to COVID-19.
Under the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low risk of exposure to occupational exposure is minimal to the public and other colleagues, so basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay at home after illness, complying with respiratory rituals, and cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Moderate exposure risk work includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
Includes staff who have access to the general public, such as schools, high-profile work environments, and some large-scale retail environments.
In addition to the basic infection prevention measures, the group should also use efficient air filters and spray protection devices for ventilation, wear personal protective equipment and take other dangerous precautions when in contact with COVID-19 patients.
OSHA believes that exposure to medical personnel and cabin workers who are known or suspected to have a high risk of exposure to a known or suspected COVID-19 patient becomes extremely high if a worker performs an operation that produces aerosols for a known or suspected COVID-19 patient, or collects or handles specimens from it.
Hazardous control measures for such personnel include engineering control, such as pressure ventilators and personal protective equipment suitable for their tasks.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a serious impact on the workplace.
Staff may be absent due to illness, need to take care of others, or fear of exposure.
The business model may also change, including changes in demand for goods, or changes in the way in which these goods are received (e.g., purchases during off-peak hours, or use delivery or drop-off services).
Finally, product logistics from the severe COVID-19 region may be disrupted. Communicable Disease Prevention and Response Programs can be used for guidance and protection actions.
These programs address the level of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from home and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers, such as seniors or groups with chronic diseases.
These plans also provide an overview of the preventive measures needed to address these risks, as well as an emergency plan for situations that may arise due to the outbreak.
Communicable diseases prevention and response programs may require adherence to recommendations from countries or regions.
The goal of the epidemic is to reduce the spread of staff, protect the risk of adverse health complications, maintain the operation of the business, and minimize the adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the measures will also have a serious impact on the communities in which the company is affected.
The hazard prevention and control level is a widely used prevention and control framework in occupational safety and health for grouping of hazard prevention and control measures in accordance with the effectiveness.
If COVID-19 can't be eliminated completely, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control refers to the separation of employees from work-related dangers, rather than relying on the behavior of employees to control, which is also the lowest implementation cost solution.
Administrative control refers to changing work policies or procedures that require employees or employers to take action on their own.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering control and administrative control, but helps to prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE should be selected according to the risk level faced by the staff, and should be equipped according to the applicable conditions (such as respirators), and must be worn properly, inspected and maintained regularly, and replaced if necessary, and removed, cleaned, stored or treated properly to avoid pollution.
Under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low risk of exposure to work is minimal in professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all workplaces take basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, isolation of sick employees at home, compliance with breathing rituals when coughing or sneezing, providing towels and trash cans, preparing for the remote office, working out when necessary, encouraging employees to use other people's tools and equipment, and keeping the workplace clean and sanitized.
Identifying and segregating potential contagious individuals in a timely manner is key to protecting workplace staff, customers, visitors and others.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have demonstrated acute respiratory symptoms should be isolated at home for at least 24 hours until they determine that there is no fever, fever signs and any other symptoms, and the sick leave policy should be flexible to implement, allowing employees to take care of their family members at home, and should clearly inform employees of the policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk work includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within 6 feet (1.8 meters), but may result in an individual being infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the workplace or a recent COVID-19 outbreak.
These types of staff include working in schools, high-density environments and some large-volume retail environments will be exposed to the general public. Engineering control measures for the group and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, improving ventilation effects, transparent plastic spraying protection devices, and installing off-the-shelf windows to provide customer service. The administrative control of the group and high-risk groups includes encouraging sick employees to stay at home isolation, creating a fault-tolerant rotation system, eliminating unnecessary travel to COVID-19 locations, setting up emergency communication programs, including a forum to answer staff questions, providing staff with the latest education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and prevention behavior, providing protective clothing and protective equipment to workers who need protective clothing and protective equipment, providing training to help improve personal health resources and work environment, requiring hand washing, restricting staff and public access to clean-place, and other preventive measures for handwashing COVID-19 and other protective measures.
It is best to have a respirator.
If a person is ill on board the aircraft, protective measures should be taken to protect the staff and other passengers, including arranging the patient to be 6 feet away from other passengers, specifying a crew member to serve the patient, providing a mask to the patient, or requiring the patient to use a paper towel to cover his or her mouth when coughing or sneezing.
A disposable medical glove should be worn by the crew during the care of sick travelers, contact fluids or potential contaminated surfaces. If the crew members experience symptoms such as fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, they should also wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other disposable items should be kept in a biohazardous bag for cleaning and disinfection of contaminated surfaces. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, dangerous control measures are also included to delay travel if they are ill. If there is a fever or other symptoms on board, self-isolate and immediately notify the medical room on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up visits should be carried out indoors in isolation. For schools and children's conservation sites, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that if an infected person has appeared in the school, the appropriate schools and children's conservation sites should be shut down for a short period of time, regardless of the spread of the community, for a complete cleaning or disinfection.
Social distancing strategies can be implemented for low- and middle-level community transmission, such as canceling large-scale gatherings such as field trips, assemblies and sports classes, choral classes or self-catering restaurants, increasing the distance between the desks, and restricting non-essential visits, as well as arranging health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
In addition to the social distancing strategy, if the community spreads heavily, it is also possible to consider extending the suspension time. For law enforcement officers who perform routine activities, the Centers for Disease Control considers their immediate health risks to be lower.
It is recommended that law enforcement officers who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or suspect individuals act at the same level of protection as first aid medical technicians, including equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the arrest, the staff should first clean and disinfect their working belts and equipment before using the home cleaning spray or wipe after cleaning, and should follow the standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures as well as laundry sealing and cleaning procedures.
OSHA believes that certain healthcare and hospital workers face a high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk workers include healthcare, support, laboratories, and medical transport workers who actually have contact with people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
The risk of exposure is extremely high if a worker performs a missile generation process for a known or suspected COVID-19 patient, or collects or handles specimens of an infected person or suspected infected person.
Droplet generation procedures include insertion, cough teasing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or collection of cavities.
People who are at high risk of exposure include those who have been diagnosed with or suspected of COVID-19 in their lives; and those who are at higher risk of exposure if anatomy is performed. Engineering measures for this risk group also include isolation rooms for COVID-19-accidents or suspected cases, including when carrying out a drop-in generation procedure.
Some health care facilities and sedation rooms can also be equipped with a dedicated pressure-ventilating system.
Biosafety level 3 precautions should be taken at the time of treatment.
The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends a different waiting area for patients depending on whether or not they have COVID-19 suspected cases. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that people working within 6 feet of known or suspected infections with SARS-CoV-2 and persons carrying out the drop-in generation process wear a respirator.
The U.S. requires N95-approved filters or better masks to be used in a comprehensive breathing protection program environment, such as health testing, training, medical examination, etc.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve the comfort of the staff. WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO recommends that entry point screening personnel only need to wear a medical surgical mask.
For workers who need to collect respiratory specimens from COVID-19 patients and provide care or transfer services to patients without the need to carry out a drop-in production process, the WHO recommends the use of medical surgical masks, gloves, or masks.
In order to perform a waveform generation procedure, a medical surgical mask must be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 mask.
Due to the lack of supply of personal protective equipment worldwide, the WHO recommends the use of the same respirator, monitoring and coordinating of personal protective equipment supply chains, and reducing the need for personal protective equipment by means of measures such as remote medical, transparent windows, allowing direct care personnel to enter the room of COVID-19 patients, using personal protective equipment only when it is necessary for specific tasks, and continuing to use the same respirators as patients with multiple diagnosis results.

This year, we have faced some difficult situations.
In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are clearly aware of the fate of all mankind, and we are aware of our responsibilities to each other.
We are faced with unprecedented challenges, but we know that the best measures to tackle this challenge require people all over the world to feel, work together, and build a community that is at the core of Wikimedia.
All of our colleagues communicate love and care to each other by email, phone and chat, which fully proves the difference between our colleagues and why we have the privilege to work with you.
I am incredibly grateful and proud to be with you all.
Last week we were grateful for our work.
They made me realize how important it is to have access to Wikipedia all over the world at this time, and that it also made me realize the symbolic power of this critical resource to keep it working properly for people around the world.
Whether your work is responsible for the operation of the website, the payment of salaries, or the safety of the community, the normal operation of Wikipedia does not pay you much effort.
The world today needs more information from Wikipedia than ever before.
At this stage, the content of our work and the way we work will have an important impact on the world.
With the importance of this mission and the responsibility of our colleagues, we will start making some important adjustments to how we work together from next week.
Working style and timetable adjustment
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team had a meeting last night, discussing the company's work and schedule in the next few days to a few months.
At the meeting, we considered appropriate measures to address the challenges facing the company today, as well as best practices to ensure that the company remains sustainable during the pandemic.
The senior management team agrees to reduce the pressure for the company's employees, so that everyone can support the company's mission for a long time.
We support you to reduce your work pressure.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week), subject to change without notice.
This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you can work longer each day, we will arrange tasks for you according to your working hours.
However, given the unforeseen circumstances of the world today, we will prioritise your personal needs, such as caring for your family, shopping on the go, or seeing a doctor.
We do not track your work time.
If you are sick, please leave work.
It's not easy to explain, but we want to remind you, please rest assured.
You don't need to ask for sick leave or paid leave, but you need to tell the manager and help your team revise the work calendar and schedule to make sure that the key areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please inform Bryan of the talent and cultural operations department, which will support you and ensure that your situation is well cared for by the management.)
For regular employees, we will pay the full amount of the salary.
We have expressed our commitment and are committed again to our commitments to contractors and time-workers.
The salaries we pay to all of you will continue to be calculated based on their remuneration for completing their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
Even if you are sick or unable to work.
If you are willing to work, we will support you.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through work and release their own pressure.
Our work can lead to incredible returns, especially in such a time as this.
However, taking care of yourself remains the first priority.
We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we can understand your latest situation and make adjustments accordingly.
Prioritize important work.
We need to maintain the normal operation of some important tasks.
Web reliability engineering team, human resources operations team, trust and security team and fundraising team (and other teams) work is essential, which may require additional support.
We will begin to work with all departments to assess the current project objectives, and will move the focus of our work to support issues that are critical to our mission.
We all have a lot to do, but we all need to focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down will not affect future development.
We do not plan to "overtime progress" after the epidemic.
We won't ask you to track your work overtime, as it doesn't seem to be realistic right now.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new goals and schedules as appropriate.
What are the changes to the app (annual plan)?
To adapt to the new reality and daily working hours requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for the 2020-2021 schedule.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan, to replace more time for budgeting, so that all employees can prioritize key tasks and take care of themselves and their families; at the same time, adjust work arrangements for employees who need or want to reduce their workload in the next few weeks.
Extending the timetable can significantly reduce the workload of the organization's current schedule and reduce the workload.
We will make the above proposals to the Board next week. If the proposal is approved, we will update the follow-up work arrangements with our representatives and teams as soon as possible.
Thank you to the team for their leadership in the process.
Office conditions, exposure and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that a colleague at a San Francisco office may have been exposed to COVID-19.
However, with caution, we employ some antiviral cleaners to completely disinfect the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-level disinfection solutions to disinfect various surfaces as well as the halls and elevators leading to our floor.
The Office Building is implementing its Notice of Obligation Agreement to use the corresponding products to ensure the safety of the tenant.
We believe that when everyone decides to return to work, the office is fully prepared to welcome everyone.
Our Washington, D.C. office uses the WeWork office, and we share the COVID-19 protocol with us and with all our Washington, D.C. staff.
As of last week, the Washington, D.C. office has been moved to a full-time remote office in accordance with the guidelines we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as the colleagues of some New York offices have already known, we have also been discussing issues related to renting locations in Brooklyn.
The discussion will continue, but it may be delayed.
For the first time, members of the public contacted the remote office.
Some of the other long-term co-workers of the Office would like to provide some advice on how to adjust these co-workers:
The meeting time should be controlled within one to two hours.
For a longer period of time, consider dividing the contents of the meeting into multiple dates.
Identify the objectives of the meeting, develop the agenda, and send out the reading materials in advance.
Use video conferencing as the default conferencing method while collaborating and connecting online using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
In each meeting, arrange a host to host a meeting, arrange one person to monitor the questions in the chat window and keep track of changes in the list of speakers, arrange another person to be responsible (or collaborate with multiple people) to help with the meeting record.
If you need a comfortable headset, please contact the technical support department by email.
Use your health benefits to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack and discuss distributed work with colleagues
Human resource operation team is researching the human engineering guidance in the form of webinars to help all Foundation colleagues to improve work efficiency during distributed offices.
Last week, we asked all community beneficiaries to cancel wikimedia-sponsored public events before the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
These requests for cancellations and other restrictions may result in these community recipients being unable to complete the original donation activity, and we have informed them that we understand the point and have also promised that no one of them will be punished for deferring or modifying those goals.
Over the next week, we will continue to provide more guidance at Wikimania and other regional community meetings and topical community meetings.
The global community seems to be lurking in the grief caused by the pandemic, but it also reflects the comfort of being able to clearly care about their communities, Wikipedia, and others.
In the future, the CRT team will create a page on Meta-Wiki, providing a space for the community to monitor impact and keep track of community interactions with us.
Stay in touch with COVID-19 related issues
We plan to hold a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 (when coordinating the world) / 07:00 (Pacific time), and we will send you the relevant invitations in your calendar later.
At the meeting, we will share some up-to-date information, answer your questions and leave some time for discussion.
We are committed to helping you here.
At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and keep all information in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees in countries/regions that are currently severely affected by the pandemic.
If you have any questions about travel, events, main workflow, or insurance, or need other assistance, please feel free to contact the CRT team and work with them.
We are here to provide you with the support and contact you need.
If you have sensitive or confidential questions, please contact Bryan Judan, Head of Human Resource Operations, Global.
Although we face these changes, we cannot give up on our own work and obligations as a result.
Instead, the pandemic reminds us that we may need to make adjustments to our work and obligations in ways we have never done before.
We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to support each other to continue their work, to provide the support we need for our actions, and to continue to bring the services they depend on throughout the world.
Plan ahead and don't be afraid to challenge.
Let's work together to create space for the next few weeks or even months of important work.
We need everyone to contribute to achieve this goal, so please take care of yourself and your family so that we can maintain the best state of mind when needed.
Finally, please keep your hands clean and don't touch your face.
Katherine, CRT Team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) of the lungs, arteries, the heart, the kidneys and the kidneys.
ACE2 is expected to be a drug target for treating cardiovascular disease by reducing the content of vascular tension hormone II and increasing the level of Ang (1-7) to inhibit the activity of associated angiotensin-converting Enzyme (ACE). ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronaviruses into the cells.
The human version of this enzyme is commonly referred to as haACE2.
Vascular Tentrolase Conversion Enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing enzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains a N-End Peptide M2 structure domain and a C-End Collectrin transfer protein structure domain.
ACE2 is a single-way type I membrane protein whose enzyme active structure is exposed to the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
Another enzyme known as sheddingdase cracks the outer structure of the ACE2 cells from the diaphragm structure, releases the soluble protein into the bloodstream and eventually excretes it into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane, mainly the lungs type II pulmonary foam cells, small intestine epithelium cells, intravenous cells of most organs and intravenous intravenous cells and intravenous smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression has also been found in the cortex, tattoos, hypothesis, and brain stems.
The main function of ACE2 is to balance ACE.
ACE disintegrates vascular stress hormone I into vascular stress hormone II with vascular stimulation activity.
ACE2 (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) hydroxyl endocrine hydroxyl phenylalanine with vascular proliferation (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down many other peptides, including dealinine 9 slow peptides, apelin peptides, neurodepressants, morphine peptides A and gastrointestinal starvation.
ACE2 can also adjust the membrane transport of neutral amino acid transfer protein SLC6A19, and is related to Hartnup.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronaviruses into the cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (a virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (a virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 S1 stab proteins are combined with the enzyme structure area of ACE2 on the cellular surface, resulting in an intravenous entombment, allowing viruses and enzymes to be transferred together into the nucleus of the cells.
This entry process also requires the activation of host serine protein enzyme TMPRSS2, which is currently researching whether inhibition of the process can be used as a potential treatment method. Some have suggested that reducing the level of ACE2 in the cells may help to fight infection.
However, a number of professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.
A system review and pellet analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group."
In addition, "for patients with higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with spontaneous and heart failure, treatment with ACE inhibitors can also reduce the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, but the results are less reliable than reducing the overall risk of pneumonia."
ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered to be a new way to treat acute lung damage, which seems to improve the acute respiratory pulmonary dynamics indicators and blood oxygen balance due to fatty polysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in the human body is approximately 10 hours, with a duration of 30 minutes and a duration of 24 hours.
Some studies have shown that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with classic Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or diseases with elevated levels of cyclic vascular tension II. The therapeutic effect of rhACE2 injections on acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.
The b'COVID-19 app is a mobile software designed to help track close contacts and identify individuals who may have been infected with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some regions and jurisdictions develop or propose a lot of applications with the support of the official government.
Many frameworks for building close contacts tracking applications have been built.
Privacy issues have also attracted a lot of attention, especially if some systems need to track the geographic location of the app users.
A less invasive alternative includes using Bluetooth signals to record distance between users and other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would integrate this Bluetooth-enabled app directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government and the payment company jointly developed an application to support citizens to self-examination of contact with COVID-19 patients.
This app is currently used in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an app called TraceTogether.
The app is developed by the local IT community as an open source software release and handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona!" to track the exposure of potential infected people, helping medical institutions to respond quickly.
The app is developed by the North Macedonian Ministry of Communications and Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the Close Contact Tracking app has entered the advanced stage of development and will be available in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are also planning to launch a similar app (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the Singapore-based TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol to develop similar apps. Russia plans to launch a geo-fencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow to ensure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, lists some practical issues that may arise in the application system, including false positive error messages, and may lack effectiveness if only a small number of people use the application.
In order to avoid the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple has set restrictions on the type of organization that can publish coronavirus-related applications in the Apple App Store, that is, limited to "official" or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy rights activists expressed concerns about large-scale monitoring of the use of coronavirus applications, especially after the threat of the epidemic eradication, should be removed as a monitoring infrastructure to cope with the coronavirus epidemic.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on this type of monitoring.
There are eight requirements to be met for government projects:
The monitoring must be "legitimate, necessary and symmetrical";
Monitoring and monitoring expansion must have the "sunset" terms;
The data collected will only be used for the purposes of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected, and evidence shows that it is effectively protected;
Digital monitoring must avoid exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization.
Any data sharing between third parties shall be defined in accordance with law;
It is necessary to provide safeguards to prevent data misuse and provide citizens with rights to respond to data misuse;
All "relevant stakeholders" are required to "actually participate", including requiring public health experts and marginalized groups to participate in them. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also released a checklist.
The Google/Apple Agenda is designed to address ongoing monitoring issues and remove them from the device operating system once they no longer need to be tracked.
Some countries use location tracking based on the network rather than the application, and the user does not need to download the application, but also avoids the case of being tracked.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
A network solution with access to raw location data can cause serious privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server require access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that only use a central server to communicate with each other have been created (see below).
South Korea launched a non-application-based system to perform contact tracing tasks.
The system does not use specialized applications, but instead chooses to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combines this information to send notifications to potential infected people via SMS.
In addition to using this information to remind potential close contacts, the government is also allowed to publicly disclose location information, as the country has made significant adjustments to the information privacy law after the outbreak of the MERS epidemic.
This information is available to the public through many applications and websites. There are also countries (including Germany) that consider using a centralized system and a privacy protection system at the same time.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been announced.
Privacy protection close contacts tracking is a well-known concept with a large number of research papers dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts have researched privacy protection solutions such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record distances between users and other phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordinated solution that includes a centralized and distributed approach, not a single protocol. Dispersion protocols include distributed privacy protection near-by tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, originally known as contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols, and mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT).
Under these agreements, personally identifiable personal data will never leave the device, and all matches will be carried out on the device.
The MIT Media Lab's privacy team has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection technologies when collecting and using location or path cross-data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the White Paper Research Content Development, released in March 2020. In addition, Enigma MPC, a company originally founded and committed to the development of privacy technology at the MIT Media Lab, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to support users sharing sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, some groups collectively formed the Global TCN Alliance, which aims to reduce fragmentation of information and support global interoperability of tracking and alarming applications, which is a key to achieving a wide range of applications.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that its official government application was using the Open Source BlueTrace protocol.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, who respectively control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a close contact tracking program that combines Bluetooth low-power technology with privacy-protected encryption technology, which plays a role in protecting privacy.
They also released the core technical specifications used in the system.
Apple and Google said that the system plan was launched in three phases:
Introduced some tools to support the government in creating an official coronavirus tracking app that protects privacy
Integrate this feature directly into iOS and Android systems, Google and Apple plan to first launch the system through the OS update, and after the pandemic threat will also remove the system in the same way, in order to solve the problem of follow-up monitoring.
A drug repositioning (also known as a drug repurposing, reassessing, redistribution or treatment conversion) refers to the use of an approved drug for treatment of a disease or medical condition that is different from its original research and development purpose.
It is currently a scientific research course for the development of safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the recovery of blood transfusions. There are about 66 proteins available for use in pharmaceuticals, each with multiple combination points.
Analyzing these combined locations provides a reasonable solution for developing effective antiviral drugs targeting COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papaya-like protein enzymes, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, decyclases, S-proteins, and ADP RNA diphosphase.

The use of the drug by pregnant women or pregnant women may be unsafe.
A study on Lopinave/Letonave (the combination of antiviral drugs Lopinave and Letonave) concluded that "no benefit has been observed."
These drugs are designed to inhibit the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by combining them with protein enzymes.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to refine drugs to find compounds that can be combined with SARS-CoV-2 protein enzymes. The scientific community criticises the use of resources for drugs specifically developed for HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
The World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced Lopinave/Litonavein to the International Unit Test.
Radixive is a drug created and developed by Glyde Scientific Inc. to treat Ebola virus and Malburg virus infection. Radixive Scientific Inc. later found that Radixive has an antiviral activity in the body against a variety of viral viruses, pneumonia viruses, side-stick viruses and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is that resistance through mutations can lead to more serious diseases and spreads.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that Red Seaweed may have a higher resistance to the drug genetic barrier. Several clinical trials are currently underway, two of which are conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for patients with moderate symptoms and the other for patients with more severe symptoms.
There are currently three vitamin C intravenous injection clinical trials for patients with severe COVID-19 hospitalization; two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one non-traditional test (Italy).

b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against COVID-19.
While there is no vaccine to complete the clinical trials, there are many attempts to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said there would be no vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 within 18 months.
In April, five candidates were enrolled in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was reported in December 2019.

Many organizations are developing potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using a previously released viral genome.
CEPI proposed a vaccine development plan in April, stating that the urgency of its mission is speed, productivity, mass deployment and global accessibility.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were working on and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines in early 2020.
Key Platform Targets for Access to Phase I Security Studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (stage I developers and candidate vaccines: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (stage I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus carrier)
CEPI scientists reported in April that there were a total of 115 candidates in the early stages of development, of which 78 were recognized as ongoing projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 were announced, with little or no public information (predicting being planned or designed).
Phase I-II tests are conducted for initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually for random and multiple points of comparison of placebo, while identifying more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests often involve more participants, which include a control group, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring the adverse reactions when the best doses are taken.
Among the 79 actively developed vaccines (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated (still in the "preclinical" study).
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it is studying the potential of a molecular tungsten vaccine, which can be genetically modified for viral proteins to stimulate immune response.

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities concentrated resources combined with cloud computing resources from HP, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to access IBM's supercomputers.
Some vaccines have a heterogeneous effect, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that in addition to prevention of disease, they also have other benefits.
Further random trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health care workers.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or ineffective.
Early studies using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other experimental animals, and non-human-talented animals, to assess vaccine efficacy have shown the need to take biosafety levels of containment measures for living viruses, and coordinate internationally to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, no SARS treatment or preventative vaccine has been available.
According to the research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS are urgently needed by governments and public health authorities around the world.
In the context of the MERS epidemic, it is believed that existing SARS studies can provide useful templates for the development of vaccines and therapies targeting MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I human clinical trials, as well as three vaccines under development, all of which are viral carrier vaccines, two are adenovirus carrier vaccines (ChaAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA carrier vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
A variety of social media articles contribute to conspiracy, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and is already available for vaccination.
The patents referenced in various social media articles refer to existing coronaviruses (such as SARS) strain gene sequences and vaccines.
2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and stress.
Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle soreness, diarrhea, pharynx, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The incubation period from contact with the patient to the disease is 2-14 days, usually about 5 days.
Although most cases are mild, some cases develop viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, the total number of cases reported in 210 countries and regions worldwide exceeded 224 million, with more than 153,000 deaths.
Currently, over 568,000 people have been treated for rehabilitation. The virus is mainly spread between people through close contact, often by the droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
Even though the airflow produces a drop, the droplets usually fall to the surface of the ground or a variety of objects, and do not cause long-distance transmission.
In addition, if someone touches the surface of the virus and then touches the mouth of the eye, it may also infect the virus.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on the surface of the object.
Although the pre-release and recovery period may also be spread, the most infectious three days before the occurrence of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is to conduct a real-time reverse retrenchment polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test.
Masks are recommended for people with suspected viral infections and their caregivers.
The public's recommendations for wearing masks vary, and some authorities oppose wearing masks, while others require wearing masks.
There are currently no COVID-19 vaccines or special effects antiviral treatment options available.
Most of the six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
People with viral infections may have no symptoms and may have suspected flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and stress.
Urgent symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or chest numbness, blurred consciousness, difficulty in being sober and tingling on the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
Some cases may be accompanied by symptoms of upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, runny nose or throat pain.
In addition, different proportions of gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as vomiting, vomiting and diarrhea are also monitored.
In some cases, only heart and chest symptoms are present in some cases in China.
Some cases may develop viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death.
We call this the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but it can range from 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected people show symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, according to the report.
The role of symptom-free people in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully defined; however, the preliminary evidence suggests that symptom-free people may promote the spread of the disease.
The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases did not show any symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has included symptom-free cases as of April 1, with 130 (78%) of the 166 infected people on the day being tested.
Sputum and saliva can carry a large number of viruses.
There is more talk than a normal talk.
A study in Singapore found that unshakable coughs could lead to the spread of a droplet of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although these viruses are generally not transmitted through the air, the American National Academy of Sciences recognizes that the virus RNA-positive samples may be detected by an air collector in the corridor outside the ward.
Medical procedures such as plugs and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause airborne transmission.
Some people are worried that the virus may spread through urinary tract, but this risk is considered to be lower. When a patient develops symptoms, the virus is most contagious; although the symptoms may spread before they develop, the risk is lower.
According to the European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC), although the spread of the new coronavirus is not yet fully clarified, one person in general can transmit 2-3 people. The virus survives on the surface of an object for several hours to a few days.
Specifically, the novel coronavirus is known to survive on paper for a day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% pure copper products for up to four hours.
However, their survival time is also affected by humidity and temperature.
If used correctly, soap and detergents can also be used to kill viruses. Soaps can reduce the cellulite layer of the virus and cause it to lose activity while removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzene chloride and chloride Gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China showed that an average saliva sample was collected two days after admission.
5/6 Patient's first sample has the highest viral load and 1/6 patient's second day has the highest reported viral load.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), first separated from three pneumonia patients in a batch of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in nature-related coronaviruses.
Before the virus enters the body, it can be extinguished with household soap, as soap can destroy the protective membrane of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the initial SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most severe organ affected by COVID-19, as the virus enters the host cells through vascular stress-transformation enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the highest in lung type II lung buoy cells.
The virus merges into the host cells through a special surface glycoprotein called "stab" (cylindrical particulate matter) with ACE2.
12% of patients receiving treatment in hospitals in Wuhan, China found acute heart muscle damage, with a higher proportion of patients with serious illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms are higher because of the deterioration of the condition, but acute cardiovascular damage may also be related to the ACE2 receptor of the heart.
The ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in the heart and is involved in the regulation of heart function.
The thrombosis (31%) and intravenous thrombosis (25%) of ICU-controlled COVID-19 infections are higher and may be related to pre-employment. COVID-19 has been found in the patient's body examination to cause comorbid lung damage (DAD) and lymphocytes inflammatory immersion in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is ludicrous to respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2, people with severe COVID-19 may experience an excessive inflammatory response to the whole body.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells in the COVID-19 patient's body are related to the raising of inflammationd IL-6 secretion mononuclear cells and severe lung pathology.
The body was also reported to have lymphocytes inflamed.
A number of disease testing programs have been published.
The standard test method is to use real-time reverse regression polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually tested for samples of respiratory tract obtained through a nasal swab; however, a sample of sputum or sputum can also be used.
Generally, results can be obtained in a few hours to two days.
Blood test can also be performed, but the blood sample is required to be collected twice for a period of two weeks, and the result is almost no immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the coronavirus strain and publish genetic sequences to enable independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing agents in laboratories around the world to detect infections.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (not only to detect active infections, but also to detect whether a person has previously been infected with the virus) is still under development, but has not been promoted.
According to China's experience, the accuracy of testing is only 60% to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. FDA approved the first real-time diagnostic reagent and was put into use at the end of the month. A diagnostic guide published by the University of Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital proposed the method of detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Early infections are more likely to have double-pulmonary multi-fertilized glass shadows, with peripheral asymmetry and postpartum cloths.
With the development of the virus, there may be obvious under the chest membrane, rocky road signs (the gap between the thicker and different degrees of lung enrichment) and lung real changes.
There is very little information about COVID-19 micropathic injuries and pathology.
The main pathology of the body was found as follows:
Eye examinations: chest infection, heart attack, pneumonia and pulmonary musculoskeletal ulcers
Four severe levels of viral pneumonia have been observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary musculoskeletal, pulmonary cell proliferation, large amounts of atypical pulmonary cells, interstitial inflammation associated with lymphocytes, and formation of multi-nucleic acids
Severe Pneumonia: A pulmonary bubble damage (DAD) is accompanied by a pulmonary bubble drain.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory comorbidity syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Recovery period pneumonia: pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary cavity depletion and inter-pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular blood clotting (DIC); pre-pregnancy-pregnancy red blood cells reaction
To reduce the chance of infection, preventive measures can be taken: stay home; avoid entering dense areas; wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintain a good respiratory health; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends shoving your nose with a paper towel when coughing or sneezing; if you don't have a paper towel, it is recommended to use a side mask inside your elbow.
It is recommended to wash your hands properly after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends wearing a mask on public places to prevent the spread of virus to some extent. The core of the social distancing strategy is to close schools and workplaces, restrict travel and cancel large public assemblies, thereby reducing the chances of infection exposure to large-scale groups.
In addition, the social distancing guidelines regulate the retention of at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) of distance in interpersonal relationships.
There is no effective way to prevent COVID-19. As vaccines are expected to be developed by at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the pandemic are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, which is known as the "lapid epidemiological curve".
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when there is obvious dirt in the toilet or in the hands, before meals, and after nasal sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
In addition, it is also recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content, but only when there is no soap or water around them. For areas where water-free hand sanitizer is not available, the WHO offers two formulations for in-house production.
These formulas stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropyl alcohol.
Using hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a "hand disinfection active substance."
Add glycerin as a hygienist.
Provide supportive care to people, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other important organ support affected.
The CDC recommends that a suspected viral carrier wears a simple mask.
The external membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to relieve symptoms of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still pending.
It is recommended to maintain personal hygiene and promote healthy lifestyle and eating habits, thereby enhancing immunity.
Support for sexual therapy may be effective for people with early stages of infection. WHO and the China National Health Commission have launched an initiative to call for proper care for COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.
U.S. experts in critical illness and pulmonary specialists have compiled a comprehensive list of the treatment recommendations offered by various agencies and are available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, COVID-19 treatment has not been developed.
For some symptoms, some medical experts recommend the use of paracetamol ( against acetylaminophenol) in place of ibuprofen for first-line therapy.
Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission and to complete operations that may produce aerosols in a medical environment, such as plugs or by means of ventilation, especially when taking precautions.
For caregivers of COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that in addition to standard precautions, contact prevention measures and airborne transmission prevention measures, patients should also be transferred to the airborne transmission disease isolation room (AIIR). CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If possible, it is best to use a respirator instead of a mask.
N95 masks are permitted for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of such masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is mainly used to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (such as dust), but for other purposes, it cannot guarantee effective isolation of specific biological agents.
If there is no mask, the CDC recommends that the mask be used, and if necessary, can also wear a self-made mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are relatively mild and do not require the use of mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
Doctors are actively conducting research to provide breathing support for COVID-19 patients who have symptoms of respiratory failure. There is evidence that fluorescence through high-traffic oxygen treatment of the nose or positive pressure of the biphase gaseous ventilator can be avoided.
It is not clear whether the above two treatment options have the same effect on patients with severe illness.
If conditions allow, some doctors tend to use innovative mechanical ventilation, as compared to high-traffic oxygen therapy through the nose, this technique can also limit the proliferation of aerosol particles.
In many developed countries, the number of beds per capita is insufficient, and due to medical conditions, the medical system cannot cope with the severe situation that requires hospitalization due to the surge in the number of cases of COVID-19.
A study in China found that 5% of patients had to be sent to a intensive care facility, 2.3% had to be mechanized and 1.4% would die from this.
About 30% of COVID-19 admitted patients in China are eventually sent to ICU.
With the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical ventilation has increased and the difficulty of oxygen has increased.
In this case, the ventilator with pressure control mode and high PEEP should be used to maximize the oxygen delivery, while minimizing the risk of ventilators causing lung damage and chest.
Old ventilators may not be able to achieve high PEEP.
Since January 2020, we have started researching potential therapies, and there are currently several antiviral drugs in clinical trials.
Radix is considered to be one of the most promising drugs available today.
Despite the possibility that new drugs will be developed in 2021, some of the drugs that were tested have either been approved for other purposes or have entered the advanced testing phase.
Patients with severe illness may try to use antiviral drugs.
WHO calls on volunteers to participate in potential therapeutic effectiveness and safety trials. The FDA has temporarily authorized the restoration of phased blood transfusions as an experimental treatment to treat life-threatening critical illness patients.
No clinical study has been conducted to prove that the therapy is safe and effective for the treatment of the disease.
In February 2020, China released a mobile application to curb the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number upon request.
This application can detect "close contact" by monitoring data, and thus determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
The app will not only recommend self-isolation, but also alert local health officials once potential risks are detected. Integrated use of mobile phone data big data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected people and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government approved security agencies to track mobile phone data for suspected coronavirus carriers.
The purpose of this measure is to force the isolation of individuals who may have been infected.
In March 2020, German Telecom shared aggregated mobile location data with the Robert Cochlear Institute of Federal Government in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect persons who are in violation of the quarantine regulations.
Giulio Gallera, an Italian regional health commissioner, said mobile operator data showed that "40% of the citizens are still walking around."
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid is calling for innovative solutions globally to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Isolation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of infection, all of which can cause trouble.
BBC cites Rory O'Connor's point of view, "The feeling of social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn is the perfect storm that hurts people's mental health and well-being."
The disease is milder, and the symptoms are rare or even do not show symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
A mild case can usually be recovered within two weeks, while a critical or critical case can take three to six weeks to recover.
According to other similar viruses (such as SARS and MERS), pregnant women develop a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, but lack of support for COVID-19 data. COVID-19 may have an impact on the lungs of some people, causing pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into an acute respiratory comorbidity syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure, hematopoietic shock, or multi-organ functional failure.
COVID-19 related complications include anemia, coagulation anomalies, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% of COVID-19 admitted patients have an abnormality in coagulation, especially during the initial period of coagulation enzyme, while 4% of patients experience abnormality in kidney function.
About 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (derived amino enzymes).
According to the same report, the average duration of hospitalization from illness to death is ten days, with the average duration of hospitalization being five days.
However, the average time for hospital admission to ICU is seven days.
Early case studies have found that the average time from the occurrence of early symptoms to death is 14 days and the overall time range is 6 to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Council of China (NHC) found that the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
The body anatomy of the lungs sample tissue pathology examination shows that both the lungs have a roll-over lung damage with cell fiber mucus secretion.
Pulmonary cells observe viral cell mutations.
Pulmonary images are similar to acute respiratory compulsive syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, 11.8% caused heart damage as a result of a higher level of compost protein or cardiac arrest.
According to data released in the U.S. in March, 89% of admitted patients had a pre-existing medical history.
Due to regional differences and methods of difficulty, the results of disease mortality estimation vary.
Underestimating mild cases can lead to overestimate mortality.
However, if death is caused by a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 patients and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death. People are worried about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority in China found that the lung activity of some people with disabilities decreased by 20% to 30% and the lung scan showed organ damage.
In addition, after rehabilitation, you may be faced with a syndrome after intensive care.
As of March 2020, it is not yet clear whether existing infections can lead to long-lasting immunity for survivors.
According to the behavioral characteristics of other coronaviruses, it is possible to develop immunity, but it is reported that some COVID-19 cases will soon be tested for positive coronavirus.
These cases are considered to be continuous infection deterioration rather than re-infection.
The virus is considered a natural virus, originating from animals, by overflowing infections.
The actual origins have not been determined, but as of December 2019, infections are almost entirely intermittent.
The first 41 COVID-19 case studies published in the Willow Knives in January 2020 showed that the earliest period of disease was December 1, 2019.
The earliest delivery date for the WHO official publication is December 8, 2019.
Numerous methods are used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region, and are affected by population characteristics such as test volume, quality of health system, treatment options, time of the outbreak, age, gender, and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07.1 to the laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, and assigned U07.2 to the clinical or epidemiological diagnosis infected with COVID-19 but not tested in the laboratory. The mortality rate is equal to the total number of deaths within a given period divided by the total number of cases identified.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The mortality rates in different regions are also different. Other measurement criteria include Case Death Rate (CFR) and Infection Death Rate (IFR), which reflect the percentage of disease deaths as a percentage of the number of confirmed patients, and the percentage of disease deaths as a percentage of infections (including both confirmed and undiagnosed).
These statistics have no time limit, and tracking is the entire process of solving a specific population from infection to case.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infected people.
Castiglione d'Adda is a small town with only 4600 people and currently 80 (1.7%) die from the pandemic.
At Gangelt, the epidemic spreads through various ordeals, and even affects young people, but the mortality rate is relatively low, not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
Germany's medical system is not overcrowded.
According to the Blood Donor Assessment, about 3% of Dutch citizens may be antibodies.
To date, 69 people (0.004% of total population) have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate varies by gender.
Studies in China and Italy show that the mortality rate for men is higher than for women.
Males aged 50-60 are at the highest risk of death, with a gender gap of only 90 years old.
The mortality rate for men in China is 2.8% and the mortality rate for women is 1.7%.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown, but may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
According to gender-based immunological differences, women have a lower rate of smoking, and men have aggregation (such as high blood pressure) age lower than women, resulting in higher mortality rates for men than women.
In Europe, 57 percent of men are infected, up to 72 percent of men are killed due to COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that the effects of viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS are different for both men and women.
Women's health workers (especially nurses) have higher rates of exposure to the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease was officially named "COVID-19."
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the WHO, explains that CO stands for "corona", VI stands for "virus", D stands for "illness", and 19 stands for the first outbreak of the pandemic (December 31, 2019).
The reason for choosing this name is to avoid reference to specific geographic locations (e.g., China, animal species or population) in order to comply with international naming recommendations for preventing stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, WHO is also using the "COVID-19 virus" and "a virus that causes COVID-19" in mass transmission.
Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak of Wuhan, people generally refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, according to a 2015 guide on the use of locations in disease and virus names, 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases are recommended as the names of temporary viruses and diseases.
On February 11, 2020, the official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released.
Due to the limitation of capacity in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers began printing health care materials such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
For example, an Italian hospital urgently needs a ventilator valve, and the supplier cannot deliver the parts within the required time, a local start-up company reverse engineering, and print out the 100 ventilators needed overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, error messages, and false information about the origin, size, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease spread quickly through the network.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
Research evidence that no virus replication has been found in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
Government agencies, academics and industry researchers are actively researching and developing vaccines and drugs to treat COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a "combined test" to assess the treatment effects of the four existing antiviral compounds that are most likely to have a therapeutic effect.
There are currently no vaccines available, but all levels are actively developing vaccines.
Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have entered human cells through the ACE2 receptor, previous work on SARS-CoV is required.
Three vaccines are being developed.
First, researchers plan to develop a full-virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, is intended to stimulate the rapid immune response of the human body when it is newly infected with COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop a vaccine that is designed to stimulate the immune system to make sensitive reactions to certain subunits of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, these studies focus on complementary virus invading the S stab protein of the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a novel vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the experimental vaccines developed by these strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched their first vaccine clinical trials.
Vaccines contain a harmless sequence of genes that have been copied from viruses that cause disease. People have always believed that antibody dependence augmentation could be a major challenge in the development of the SARS-COVID-2 vaccine, but there is a dispute.
As of April 2020, there were more than 300 clinical trials carried out.
Seven tests have been evaluated and approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydrochloride or chlorine.
Conversion of antiviral drugs accounts for the vast majority of research in China, with nine Phase III clinical trials being conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review has been conducted on the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs. Several existing antiviral drugs that treat COVID-19 are currently being evaluated, including Redseve, Chloroquine and Hydrochloroquine, Lopinave/Litonave and Lopinave/Litonave combinations of interfering agents.
As of March 2020, the efficacy of Radsey's treatment has been initially confirmed.
It has been observed that clinical symptoms have been relieved in patients treated with sympathetic drugs.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy at this stage. In February 2020, China launched a study of chloroquine (previously used to treat malaria) and achieved preliminary results.
However, the study was asked to conduct a peer-review.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking 1 g per day while reminding you that the dose is extremely dangerous and may even be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for chlorine and hydrochloroquine, but the doctor has the right to decide whether to use the above two drugs to treat COVID-19 patients. The Seventh Edition of China guidelines also propose the use of disruptors, libavaline, or hydrochloric acid Abidoll to treat COVID-19.
Preliminary data shows that high-dose libavirin has a inhibition effect on SARS-CoV-2 in the body.
After confirming the low-density inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, further in-body research is recommended with nitrosinine. Studies show that the original spear proteins caused by transmembrane enzyme serine 2 (TMRSS2) are a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors to interact with the human body.
Whether or not used in combination with Azithromycin, chloroquine and hydrochloroquine studies have serious limitations, and the medical community is unable to accept these treatments unless further research has been done.
The cytokine storm can be a concomitant post-diagnosis treatment for people with severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydrochloroquine may have anti-cellular factor storm characteristics. After completing a small study, the National Health Commission of China included the Tobu antibody in the treatment guide.
Following the positive test results for patients with inherited critical illness, Italy is conducting a national phase 2 non-random test.
Combined with serotonin protein blood test, the detection of cytokine storms is designed to curb the development of the disease, and cytokine storms are considered to cause death of some infected people.
In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, the FDA approved the use of leukocytes 6 receptor-based antibodies to treat steroids that are caused by other reasons, the CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no randomized evidence to prove that the beads can effectively treat CRS.
It is currently researching the extraction of pure enriched antibodies produced by the COVID-19 recovery immune system, injecting them to people who need antibodies, as passive immunotherapy prior to the successful development of the vaccine.
This strategy was tried during the SARS epidemic, but the effectiveness of the treatment has not been determined.
Antibody therapy for both passive and passive therapy is an expected action mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 immunity defense.
However, some other mechanisms, such as antibodies-dependent cell toxicity and/or phasing, can also achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy are currently being developed, such as the use of artificial monoclonal antibody.
The amount of rejuvenating serum production may increase and is conducive to rapid deployment. The serum is composed of the liquid portion of the rejuvenating patient's blood, which contains special antibodies to the virus.
Coronavirus disease, a closely related syndrome
Dr. Wen-Liang Li, a hospital in Wuhan City, raised awareness of the spread of the coronavirus, and later died after being infected with COVID-19.
