Students at the Zhejiang University Annual Conference sing the main character of the research results to open the brain hole - New China Network
Hand washing with air, hakou air to judge the disease, the exact search of the source of the zodiac last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-holes opened academic results were recognized.
The main researchers of these results are students, research covering the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and other major fields, students from a curious point of view, created a number of high-end inventions with application value, some of which have been awarded in the domestic international awards.
Biosensor: Your Family Medical Examiner
The Department of Biomedicine Engineering, a PhD student from the Department of Biomedicine, presented a smartphone-based biosensor, which is only half the size of the smartphone.
"You only need to breathe a little, and the instrument can initially detect your physical health from the gas components you breathe."
The sensor is connected to the smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after the gas is called out.
The market can detect the health status of the smart ring, the general test is temperature, pulse and other physical parameters.
The biosensor uses graphene as a new material, and its target is chemical elements, and the sensitive "smelling" allows it to be more profound and accurate in terms of physical health.
Smart surgical lamp: high-energy eyes of a doctor
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won the Silver Award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Master Zhu Linjing of the School of Optoelectronics Science and Engineering, Shen Junfei team opened a new idea in the defects of traditional operation lights, invented intelligent LED operation no shadows.
"A lot of early detection and removal of diseases are related to the lights used in the operating room of the doctor."
She said, for example, when early cancer screening, if the doctor can not see all the tumor tissues in a timely manner, then the cancer cells will spread.
This smart surgical light has four discs to increase the difference between different organizations in the light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectra, color uniformity and no shadow rate at any time according to the operation needs and personal habits.
This smart surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated with Shaw Run Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated with Children's Hospital.
Last October, the invention received the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, a lot of rubbing soap, pointing hand sanitizer, and other college students have invented a set of "air-air hand sanitizer".
As long as the washing machine on the stand, our weight can be reduced by air compression.
"It's like a gasket.
Exhausted air, formed fluids at the head of the water, and combined with water.
That way, we can wash our hands!'
Colorization reactions and bacteria retention verification: the effect of hand washing through this method is the same as the normal hand washing method.
This device only relies on our own gravity as a drive, both to ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free and energy-saving.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Major Challenge Summit, the invention was the only gold award to be won among the top universities in the world.

A certificate that makes you feel very important - First Aid
This is one of the most important certifications I've ever had in addition to my driver's license.
General: First aid measures are actually emergency relief in the event of an emergency, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is still time in the process of ambulance after the accident, which is the most important time.
This is a time when first aid is needed.
If I really have heart disease, brain overflowing, and breath stops, then the window of our life is only four minutes, and the golden four minutes!
It's important for people to understand how important first aid is!
When we fall around someone, we can rescue him by professional knowledge, not silly standing there at the same time can not do anything, such a helpless feeling is too terrible to be felt.
“In China, our official data shows that three million people die unexpectedly every year, and the most dangerous cardiac arrests happen.
In the U.S., an average of 15 per cent can be saved.
Seventy-eight percent of casino hotels in Las Vegas can save, and Shanghai and Beijing are lower than 1%."
This was the first reaction of the founder.
If a person has a heart stop, no breathing, no heartbeat, you have no effect.
It is necessary to take artificial breathing and pressure outside the chest to save people.
I found that very few of us now have this awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it is not enough, so I urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in a timely manner in the face of sudden circumstances.
It is impossible to save a person's life!
First aid certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross Training Center, I am registered at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai, students also have benefits.
PS: The last map is to record the goal to be completed before the age of 25, adding the first aid certificate to the target list is also a few months ago, but it really is done!
Then go to the other certificate you want to test, plan to go to a diving certificate, before you see a diving first aid certificate in the small red book, this certificate seems to have a first aid certificate to take, so in fact, the first aid certificate is very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
There are 13 of them!
Not tested
What's the name of #name?
One to 13 yuan?
Last night #PRS_ORG, the food was leaked, and this one gave me something to eat!
It's clear that it's valid when I enter the code.
First of all, I personally think that the Four Seas is a comprehensive distro, from a variety of meanings.
But you want to say that this movie is not a highlight or not, and that it is not at least a good choice.
There are many kinds of monkeys, so that you can go to sleep in the cinema, let you see the angry filling of the same, "Four Seas" for the audience is like a monkey on the Emei mountain, it can innumerable ways to light up your fire.
In this respect, the South Korean cold is truly altruistic.
The most painful part of this piece is that it looks like a piece of cylindrical fiction, it is difficult to name, and the gap is like a blouse on Little Margo.
Even after reading it, you'll be wondering if there's a hidden metaphor for the director here, but when you think about it carefully, you'll find it's actually a shit.
First of all, there are a few things that I find difficult to understand.
The man's place of residence should be a small island in the southern part of the island, and his grandmother lives with him.
Her grandmother had a desire to see the snow, and then arranged a small van in her neighborhood to take her to the northeast to see the snow.
Old man looking in the snow from the south to the north??
He and his family are very supportive of this.
Then the old man was gone.
How do you get a business license from your sister on a abandoned cruise ship?
Why is it so easy to get around a mountain road??
Then the truck that sent the steel in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and the truck driver was not found nearby.
The feeling of this tool is too obvious.
Why does a small mixed-flying car party have a suspected violation of the law become an assistant police officer?
Why is it so hard for the police to ask the police in the movie?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the hotel with a room card, and then forced to arrange not find the hotel boss, sit outside the room and sleep?
This amazing episode is filled with the whole movie, and it hurts me when I remember them because the episode was too much from the spectator.
In addition to the plot, even worse is the subject of the movie, or that the movie does not have a subject at all, is a face detestable treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous.
At the beginning of the film you will think that he wants to take a comedy film, 20 minutes later you guess it might be a inspirational film, half of the time you feel it may be a drama that you want to reflect the youth of the small town to survive is not easy, after all, you do not know exactly what you saw, and then it is your own deep doubt, why over the years to go to the cinema to appreciate the stool.
For most people, it is also very familiar with all kinds of movie routines, such as if you want to shoot motorcycle rider, then encourage + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented bird is going to be successful step by step.
If you want to shoot a love film, then you old and true talk about the complaints between the young town of motorcycles and the service sister.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your circumstances do not appear contrary to the normal world.
(e.g., the new motorist Yin Zhengming was just burned, and then he could sing the character), can not go out of some of the kennels that Kendid saw all the remains of the brain.
As for the actress obviously not weak intelligence can be expressed in some aspects like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know whether it is the reason for the acting or the director's request.
I don't even know why I'm so excited to add a crash scene to my own movie.
Is there a way to make a movie like this in the spring?

Dr. South Africa: Omicron transmission power, but much more light
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the variant of the coronavirus Omicron is smaller than the variant of Delta, although the spread is faster.
According to the U.S. news agency, with the spread of Omicron variants in South Africa, more than 5,000 physicians in South Africa form a medical organization report that the symptoms of COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively minor, such as physical pain and coughing similar symptoms to flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said he saw dozens of patients every day, but no patients needed to be hospitalized.
"They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who had been more likely to get into severe illness due to coronavirus infection.
He said that in comparison to the previous wave of delta epidemic, he treated COVID-19 patients "with difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first reported Omicron mutation in Southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting enough data takes several weeks, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases summary: Only 30% of COVID-19 patients who have been admitted in recent weeks are seriously ill, half of the previous wave of severe illness; the average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, and 20% of cases of early outbreaks in South Africa.
"At present, almost all signs indicate that it is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, citing the data and other reports of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.
He added: "Now is the early stage, and we need to get some later data.
Usually, the hospitalization and death takes place late, and we are only two weeks into the pandemic."
At the same time, scientists around the world are monitoring the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while simultaneously testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite the fact that delta remains the world's leading COVID-19 strain, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, including South Africa as a center for the pandemic.
According to health officials, the new cases found in the province of Hauden in the first week of December increased by 400%, and the test showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of the cases.

Detailed information on where to buy the code
Education: What does it take to save a child?
If the class "no sales" the famous public welfare advertising language, then, in a good environment without the need for "absorption", crowd control, all-inclusive anti-absorption, so that the trade is not profitable, high risk, high cost, such crimes will not be rampant.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security's Bureau of Criminal Investigation kidnapping developed children's disappearance information emergency release platform line.
It is an online information platform to establish an authority channel for the release of child disappearance information, and to retrieve the kidnapped child in a timely manner.
Listen to this app called "Round", and it feels warm.
The new technology means not only the name "art", full of love, and the use of information is appropriate, practical and effective.
The primary goal of the kidnapping law is to find the kidnapping child to protect his personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list a lot of "big words."
However, prioritizing the personal safety of the victims should be given priority before the case of abduction is broken.
Important relief, under the purpose of urgent 'forgivation', such as 'whether the child should be killed or not should be put to death', the topic of discussion can be paused, and should be discussed with caution; but the things to save the child should not be put to death.
Based on the experience of these cases, the person is usually far away from the location of the case as soon as possible after obtaining the hand.
The kidnapping takes more than a minute, and the child may be far away from the parent step, and the difficulty of the case is increasing.
In this case, it is actually a practical action to draw out a platform such as the "turn around" platform that directly helps to break the case and find effective ways for children.
After all, "briefing" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to be done.
To fight crime, protect the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of justice, and the confidentiality of law enforcement, there is no need to carry out the care of "care for the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child abuse can also be improved from the family to the society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at the train station, and the parents slept well before they woke up to discover that the child was missing.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
Parents and children are at least a means of preventing kidnapping.
From the other side of the police's smuggling crime, the person who bought the kidnapped should also be concerned and remedied.
An illegal act is often just one part of a long chain.
According to the Criminal Code of China, the legal prison sentence for kidnapping is 5 years; the situation is particularly serious, can go to the death penalty, and the property is confiscation.
High prison point, the highest sentence, under the trend of "light criminalization", the crime of kidnapping is obviously a more serious crime.
There are still a lot of cases of abuse every year.
As can be seen, some people in the concept of raising children, the legal consciousness is weak.
The legal education of this person should be followed.
In order to effectively control the crime of kidnapping, it is not possible to rely solely on the official strict law enforcement.
If the take-off of the "market" exists widely, the shopper's keenness, constantly innovative means of selling, the formation of a "fighting" situation with law enforcement, the take-off of the situation will inevitably fall into inefficient mud.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness, popularizing the common sense of law, also helps to root the crime of kidnapping and acquire children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil.
virgin olive oil or natural olive oil, is directly from the fresh olive fruit from the use of mechanical cold press, after filtering and treatment to remove the oil obtained after the foreign object.
There are three levels of acidity:
Extra Virgin: The highest grade, highest quality olive oil, is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, there are light and elegant plant fragrance, the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin: slightly acidic, but not more than 2%, tastes pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Oil: The taste and flavor is good, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained after more than 3.3% acidity, or become a "secondary oil".
Olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to blend the taste with the color and sourness of less than 1.5%, transparent light gold yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil extracted from oil residues and refined by dissolving the method.
You should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It is important to note that olives, like grapes from different regions and different olive varieties, produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and temperature, daylight, air humidity, and rainfall conditions for oil olive growth.
In addition to the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted in sub-districts.
Major Area of Origin (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc.
The month of oil harvesting:
Every year from March to June, is the time of the oil olive trees to open the fruit, July to October fruit began to develop and mature, the fruit from the green transition to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is a fruit picking season (Olive oil freshness is very important).
The nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monohydrates and fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, linoleic acid, linoleic acid, linoleic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.

After the Democratic Summit, Biden says the fire of freedom will never cease
Hosted by U.S. President Biden, government with 110 countries worldwide, as well as civil society and private sector leaders attended the Summit for Democracy on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and the rule of authority can never be extinguished.
He also said he plans to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Hong Kong democratic human rights activists who are currently in exile in the United Kingdom, Luo Guanyi, spoke at the Summit the next day.
Biden said: "We know what great work it is to be put in front of us.
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, as I have said before, as this summit shows that the democratic world is everywhere.
The dictatorship will never extinguish the free fire, it will burn in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world."
Biden also said it needed a joint effort to defend democracy as a whole.
"As a government leader, it is our responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen democratic fences, to promote reform, to achieve transparent accountability and governance, to better resist the power of impunity and impunity, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest," he said.
The theme of the "Democratic Summit" Day 2 is to defend human rights, defend democracy and the fight against authority, and fight against digital authoritarianism and affirmative democratic values.
This is the "International Day of Human Rights."
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Guterres, said at the opening of the conference that day that the cause of democracy is facing global challenges, especially the emerging digital technology challenges.
"Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic tragedies.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires the reprimand of all forms of populism, domesticism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution."
A pre-recorded video by Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights Activist Mr. Luo, spoke at the Summit, reminding participants to keep an eye on the human rights situation of ethnic minorities such as Hong Kong and Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been accepting the rise of China, but there is no mechanism to criticise it.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders need to work together.
We must make use of everything we have (resources) to ensure that the resurgence of democracy is our top priority."
He also called for the freedom of the world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid to be upset by the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't want to lose, maybe some of you are unaware of the threat of our democratic values."
This is the reason for our failure.
This is one of the reasons we need to change. "
In the round table discussion of the "warning digital dictatorship and affirming democratic values" of the Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan of Taiwan stressed that Taiwan stands at the front line of the front line against the regime and authority through a video release of the National Declaration.
He also shared his experience of fighting the coronavirus through information transparency and mutual trust.
"We have always stood at the forefront of global aggression against authoritarianism and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
In the midst of the pandemic, governments around the world have shown signs of a recession in global democracy, in terms of public health and collective interest, rationalizing human rights violations.
But in Taiwan, we don't have to lock the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to pull it down to beat the fake information."
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Finance announced sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China, North Korea, who have been identified as serious human rights violations, while also implementing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that utilizes surveillance technology to assist human rights violations.

Hello, the chicken that came from the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid to stick to it, so I'd like to find a little bit of money first.
Not friendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not distinguish, then your normal situation will be cheaper than the friendly, such "entry" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very low strength, the ball hit the beat above, the vibration is very large, the hard ball top can not be, the master is difficult to drive.
The logic and subterfuge of their existence is -- tennis is so difficult, knowing that you won't learn, and knowing that you don't want to buy expensive, do a cheap mischievous trick you, you play twice, you won't play again, so this shot is cheap, you don't feel sad.
If you really can distinguish good and bad, indicating that you have made progress, when I come here to buy the expensive, I win twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand good shot, choose Prince, or Dung Pu, the two brands are enough is not famous, so the good shot is also not worth the money, the new shot 500, 600 is very good, the second-hand 200 pieces, with a thousand yuan shot enjoyment is not bad?
Friendly to newbies, but after a new stage in the chicken rib, but most of the people, especially girls, can not have a new stage.

The People's Republic of China - The Gulf Cooperation Committee meets the common challenges
The stops of King Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia include Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a ban on Qatar in the middle of 2017, King Mohammed visited Qatar for the first time since the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, and implemented a comprehensive ban on Qatar supporting terrorist organizations while having a close relationship with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions had a profound impact on the internal unity of the Haitian Union and had a negative impact on the economy of the region's countries.
Four Arab countries have blocked land and sea routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Committee Summit in January 2021, and the Gulf States signed a "unity and stability" agreement with the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened the border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making the first effort to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.

The access to both countries up to 725 km will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integration of the supply chain for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and both companies have signed 13 Memorandum of Understanding worth $3 billion.
Saudi Arabia's visit to the Gulf State coincides with the rescue of Iran's nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA), a treaty in which the Gulf Arabian State finds it impossible to resolve the issue of the Iran missile.
All Gulf countries have treated Iran as a long-term "competition" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threatening threat" to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that there is no solution to the problem of Iran's missiles and no action to contain Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia and Iran have a direct negotiations in the context of nuclear negotiations between major countries and Iran that do not meet the wishes of all Gulf countries.
The goal is to reduce the tension in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the reduction of the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Commission.
The upcoming Summit on the Sea will be the first summit of the State of the Sea since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.

The name of the new mountain super run airflow is the most!
This car is a dream come true for many of us!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4!
It is worth about $2 million, a year of road tax $1000, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, how fast can you imagine?
That said, the data says that the acceleration of 0-100 km/h takes only 2.9 seconds, and it is quite likely that the small myvi will reach 100 km/h when it reaches 30 km/h.
The low body, the scissors door, the huge imports around the body, and the endless 6.5 v12 engine on the next glass, perfectly interpreted the style of Lamborghini.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, its own Google is good, a small set of some of the things Google does not have to say!
It's too hard to see where everyone's going, it's too uncomfortable! ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((())))))))))))))))
1 km oil money at RM1 (the owner is not at all care)
It's hard to get on the bus (because you can't get off the bus and get stuck in half).
The engine is too loud and you can hear it when you get off the bus. (but it's still very loud)
The car is too big, the parking lot will be very narrow, afraid to be opened by the next door!
It's a little lonely, because there's no one on the road to talk about it (it's not related to the driver, haha).
Don't be fooled, this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you would like to take a video of your car, please contact us!

A group of Asian Americans complains about discrimination in Ivy's Ivy League schools, including Yale
Xinhua News Agency Washington on May 23 (Reporter Xu Jingmei) filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on May 23 against the three permanent Ivy League schools, Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College for discrimination against Asian students during their admissions.
The Asian Alliance for Education held a press conference in Washington that day.
In the press conference, the group's president, Mr. WU Yu-qi, said the number of Asian applicants meeting the U.S.'s eligibility criteria has doubled, but among the three U.S. universities, the proportion of Asians is basically maintained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities apply to Asians in the course of so-called “integration considerations,” “long-term and systematic discrimination against Asians.”
In 2014, the study of scholars such as Sanders showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asians had the lowest access rate among all ethnic groups.
The data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools in China, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentage of Asian students, and Yale and Brown University have applied to Asian students for more than 20 years.
After filing a complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and Justice can conduct investigations and take steps to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also hope that the complainant will be able to take the initiative to address the issue and change the admissions policy for Asians.
At present, the three high schools have not responded to the complaint.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained of discrimination at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it for procedural reasons.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups, including the American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

It is not easy to look at the house, the deposit is given, and the house is also ready, but the seller does not sell, which makes Mr. Land helpless and angry.
Mr. Land then appealed to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
The trial court concluded that the two parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, can not only be attributed to the defendant, should be reasonably presumed as negotiating not, therefore the case should not apply a fixed penalty rule, the defendant is not required to bear the double return deposit default liability.
After the trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second trial court maintained its original trial.
*Regardless of the nature of the transaction, the necessary attention should be paid to the obligations of the client.

The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, the implementation of 'democracy reform', unilateral sanctions, mobilize the 'color revolution', resulting in catastrophic consequences."
"Democracy has become a "massive weapon" for the United States to intervene in other countries.
The summit is a demonstration of Biden's commitment to the election.
A two-day conference was held in a video format, where 111 national leaders from around the world were invited to the conference, including Taiwan leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia confronted the United States with their own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
The international and American voice has also questioned, such as criticizing the invitations to the conference, including some leaders with authority-controlled tendencies, such as the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, some people suspect that the true intention of the Biden administration is not for democracy, but to organize the summit for geopolitical purposes.
The former German Prime Minister, Shores, also took part in the Video Democracy Summit
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said on Saturday, "Today's U.S. democracies are showing, monetary politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial contradictions, poverty disparity and so on.
In a speech, President Joe Biden said, "As a government leader, it is our responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen our democratic fences, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, more resistant to the power of impunity and impunity, and those who want to pursue power before the public interest is negligible."
"Democracy is not meant to be a matter of course," he added. "We must constantly update it among every generation, and this, in my opinion, is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that when global democracy and human rights are "in the face of persistent and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend."

Education Thinking: How to make the "school" and "school" get their own - Xinhua Network
Three students at Lanzhou Jiaotong University write a letter to the school leadership, reflecting the confusion of college exams, and propose to improve the difficulty of the exam, change the exam question type, so that the exam really reflects the actual level of the student's appeal.
In fact, for a long time, college exams have been a "hot topic."
In the university campus, students come from five lakes and four seas, the ability level is different, plus the degree of study is different, the learning situation is different.
There are different feelings for groups with such diverse characteristics, it is difficult to assess.
Of course, if the test question type is single, high repetition rate, the question is too simple, it will certainly lead to another very different feeling.
Students who do not work may be able to pass the pre-examination, if they want to think about other methods, it may be possible to achieve a multiplier effect.
In this way, the occurrence of "school grounds" can also be overly related, even high scores; "school barge" will never fail to take lessons, work, notes are like good, the exam is not higher than the "query status."
In this way, students at Lanzhou university reflect that the problems in the university examination are not endless, and I believe that this situation is not only the state of Lanzhou university.
In this context, it is important to note that these three students have a clear understanding of the situation.
In fact, the people who have passed the university are clear, the emphasis on the preparation of the exam, want to a variety of ways from the teacher 'situation' exam, for the scope of the exam, to get the 'focus guidance' before the exam, the phenomenon is not very common, even in the exam to take a small copy, after the examination of the teacher to raise your hands is not a surprise.
In the opinion of the author, as a teaching quality assessment guide, to measure the qualification of a university exam or not, is more in the teacher's full grasp of teaching and learning, and on this basis the scientific proposition.
Enter the undergraduate level of the university, the professional start in detail, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge of a subject is the content of the university examination to examine.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of science and basic common sense, from the point of view of knowledge, the space of change is not large, basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics at the University 20 years ago is still being studied and focused."
However, the knowledge point is basically unchanged, and does not mean that the test type is unique, and the test question is repeated.
In many universities, the exam will generally be formed into a topic group, and then by the academic senior teachers integrated into the exam paper, the exam paper is also responsible for the department's entire teacher participation, so that to a certain extent, it can overcome the duplicate of the question.
However, to prepare a set of teaching and learning practical test questions, according to the overall situation of students learning, it is difficult to be positive distribution, but also need to master the situation of teaching, comprehensive analysis of the degree of student learning, so that the test title is difficult, the question type has a dynamic grasp, both highlighting the basic knowledge inspection, but also take into account the ability of the test, while the topic type for innovative design.
The examination is the commander of university education, what kind of examination, students will have the corresponding preparation program, long time, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For students' recommendation letter, Lanzhou University has a high emphasis on rectification program has been deployed throughout the school.
To require teachers of each teaching unit to carry out research and curriculum end-of-course examinations in accordance with self-examination, to develop test title and related systems, while strengthening the test title and audit section of the supervision and examination, detailed performance evaluation, and to strengthen the comprehensive assessment of the curriculum and teaching sections.
From the mechanism to solve the question type of single, double and other problems is the college examination needs to face the issue, of course, the corresponding system, but the work of expensive in the day-to-day, the need for teachers to fully master the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student learning situation, both eat through, teaching and learning will be better intertwined, forming a good interaction, the exam will also be more in line with the actual, so that the 'learning hegemony' and 'school grounds' to get their own.

20 Years of Bloodthirsty Killing in the U.S. Oil Pipeline Video - The New China Network
(Video source: Oil Pipe)
On December 11, a micro-recorder called "The Killing Machine" on the pipeline platform caused widespread concern.
The film tells the United States of America to wage war in Afghanistan under the name of "terrorist", to export American democracy through war, 20 years of poor soldiers, bloodthirsty and innocent killings, and to commit various types of anti-human crimes.
To distort human nature and set up a murder group in civil places such as unmanned aerial bombing hospitals and schools.
Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians have been killed by U.S. troops in 20 years.
The U.S. military set up a "jail" to impose a variety of torture and personal humiliation on "suspected" criminals.
An anti-human crime sparked the hatred of more Afghans.
As the video says, the American "terrorist" war "the more fear".
The war did not bring peace, democracy and plentiful hope to the people of Afghanistan, but only a state and countless killings and destructions.
Join us to reveal the truth of the United States' "anti-terrorism", bloodthirsty killing, and the fake face of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from the business point of view and the preservation period to talk about why this customer to bond the logistics company in the area to help make cans, although the cans belong to deep processing, does not belong to the bonded logistics company's business scope, here is the text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I go to the manufacturer of a lot of milk powder, contact the production line of a lot of milk powder.
In fact, their raw materials are the same as the milk powder they are wearing, and there is no difference.
The question is, why is the shelf life of the bag a year, and the shelf life of the garment is two years or longer?
Or ask yourself, why is the price difference between the earphones and the bag?
In fact, from this point of view, a lot of consumers, or at the mother level, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
The raw materials are just as good as you think they are.
There is also a consumer reaction from this mindset that the sound or taste is different!
Now I'm going to talk about the reason why you're here, where are you?
Why is the price of raw materials so different?
Because the majority of manufacturers at the price when considering if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are low, or that there is no profit, what do the manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, at the price of listening, they have a large increase to protect their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers are focused on listening, not on backpacking.
Do you want to have hundreds of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars per year?
We all want to know.
So, with the development of society, the marketing costs of the market, such as: the promotion staff of the mall, the display cost of the mall, the product's gift costs, advertising costs, etc. are constantly increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are listening, and their prices are constantly increasing, which is actually a new product as the cost of the market increases.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials to increase will not exceed 3 or 4 dollars.
There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, do not choose the means, with the hospital's doctor hang, by their help product promotion, from a single listen to the profit from $30 to $80.
The relevant laws of China are absolutely not allowed to operate this method, in fact, this method is harmful to consumers.
It is recommended that you buy the milk powder in the bag under the premise of having a can in your home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and does not have any impact on children.
Also, do not think that the shelf life of the listening is longer than that of the bag, if the sound is the same as the shelf life of the bag after the package is opened, just say that the bag is not easy to save after the package is opened, it is susceptible to tide deterioration.
The food was served late, the food was cold, it was dry and hard, there was no way to eat at all.
The tomato sauce is also simmered.

Don't Be Afraid of the Dark - The New York Times
When visiting the city, you can often feel the explosion of successful textbooks.
Today's successful academic books, a lot of publicity is "the best principle" - that is to assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what needs to be done "what."
This is the most important and fundamental part of "how to do it".
That's why these books all have one common feature - whether it's a good idea to do it in a hurry, or simply something; whether it's 100, or 0; or if you're at Dun Tai Shan, or you're just sitting there.
This "best principle", so that whoever sees it will recognize it as "right," but 99% of people will be afraid to fall in front of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you want to be determined by pain, re-manufacture, the next big 180 degree transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who keep the rule of ink, keep the old and refuse to change, you prefer to shout "You want to change" in his ear, and undoubtedly self-deception, against the bullpen.
The vast majority of people will be afraid of the word "transformation" in front of the two words, wrapped up before, it is difficult to determine the determination; or with a moment of impulsive pain of the determination to "transformation", and bravely took the first step, but often the good prospect is not long, insisting that more than a child can defeat, it is difficult to see the continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From the beginning of tomorrow" is the most legendary expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the door is too high, it tends to exceed the capacity limit of ordinary people, so that the vast majority of people "see the door".
Perhaps, the "good principle" is a way to get more ordinary people on a relatively successful path.
The core of the "good principle" lies in the "reduce the door hinges" - it encourages a "small to win" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, only do the same: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Taishan, just climb the small sand dunes at your door also, because it is always stronger than the original.
In general, as long as you do something, it is not always stronger.
Since the door is greatly reduced, it increases the possibility of ordinary people to insist, and everything as long as you insist, the probability of success will also increase.
But only follow the "good principle" of the road to success, its path is a little longer.
Overall, "the best principle" Despite hitting the flag on the surface to make everyone succeed, it can eventually be encouraged, in fact, there are few; and "the second principle", in order to effectively motivate more people, as much as possible to make more people benefit.

Qinghai Lake's net food storage volume increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Xining on December 11, the reporter (reporter Yuyaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) learned from the Qinghai Agricultural Rural Bureau, the latest monitoring results show that the amount of net food storage in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, a cumulative growth of more than 40 times compared to the early protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake is known as the 'fish', which is a rare species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in the safety and biological diversity of the ecological chain of water-fish-birds in the water-bird ecosystem of Qinghai Lake.
In the 1970s, due to the increasing deterioration of the environment in the breeding and fishing waters, the number of nudity in Qinghai Lake decreased, and the nudity of nudity in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons in 2002.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake was listed as a endangered species in the Red List of Species in China.
Since 2003, the Qinghai province has implemented a ban on the fishing of all units, groups and individuals to the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and the lake, and the sale of the products of the nudity is prohibited.
At the same time, through the artificial proliferation and clearance of Qinghai Lake mainly into the lake river river, the design of scientific and reasonable "fishing channel" and other measures continue to increase the protection, Qinghai Lake nudity resource storage volume increases every year.
The Deputy Director of Agriculture and Rural Development Bureau of Qinghai Province, published that until now, Qinghai Lake has accumulated an artificial proliferation of nearly 1.8 million yuan, and the contribution rate to the recovery of resources in Qinghai Lake is more than 23%.
Qinghai Sanjiangyuan is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of western desertification to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan and Qinghai Lake waters, protect the aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Plateau. Since this year, Qinghai has issued a ban on water conservation in Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and built a comprehensive ban management system.

The question is, is there a store in a bag?
We only see one bag.
I want to know if it's missing or if we've taken it away, thanks.
It's been over an hour and it hasn't been delivered yet.
I just read an article on a vacation that is too long.
To the man who doesn't know the sci-fi.
The majority of girls experience their first public holiday on a day between the ages of 13-15 and close around the age of 50.
Physical health will be more regular once a month.
But it is not a rule to accurately predict, about a week or so tolerances, need to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the airborne difference will also be turned off (abruptly a few days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, the severity of the pain varies from person to person, some three days, some a week; some people have little flow, some big blood collapse; some people have no response, some people suffer to the ambulance transport, pain with time will change, and the previous pain does not mean that life is painless.
The month cannot be controlled, beginning to end within 24 hours of bleeding, can only be done with sanitary napkins or sanitary cotton strips to prevent bleeding to the clothing chair.
Pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandin, and the physiological period has not yet come and when the pain of the period rushed to eat buprofen can effectively relieve the pain of the month, the pain after the beginning of no more use.
Before the physiological period, due to the uterine ingestion and too much prostatin release, it is easy to pull stomach.
If the cycle is about to occur, it will be covered in the month of May, basically within two days.
It is best to replace the sanitary napkins two or three hours a day, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, except the sleep time, the worst case is to replace 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is, 42 tablets, if plus the portion prepared in advance may be 50, not one tablet per month.
(Please note that there is no need to change the hygienic cotton strip, which can be changed in about five to six hours, up to eight hours)
Menstrual period hormonal fever may be more aggressive, ovulation period will also be due to instability of hormone changes in the body, is very mild, the body makes the hormonal themselves.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control emotions is very high, and there is no excuse for emotional problems.
The flow is not just blood, it contains the decayed endometriosis.
After the end of the month, the inner lining of the inner lining is the thinnest, after slowly thickening, it can be understood that the uterus is the house, each month is built (the inner lining is thickened) ready to welcome guests, guests do not come, all removed (the month is discharged) the next month to build a new house, weekly start again.
The lunar period is not convenient, for several decades, every few days 24 hours bleeding, but also abdominal pain, who is willing?
But a man can be born because his mother came through the month, and the month is to prepare you to come to the world for the first time to stay 10 months of the house, you should thank your mother for the healthy month.
Before the women a lot of things were pressured, the society to wash women said is dirty, ashamed, everyone thought it was the same, but the times changed.
If someone feels bad after the month, feel that women's body for the preparation of life to make bad behavior, it should not be said in the general public, girls stand up, no longer think, never experienced, this life will not experience, nor how to understand the men, do not forget the negative do not know well, this attitude is good to face their mother, how do you want your own children?
Finally, it is very useful for the sisters to try the hyaluronic acid.
Today is the winter to holiday, send the wrong comparison to disappoint.
Make an extra meal for your child
I'm looking forward to checking out the stores.
Is the foot and foot numbness leaked?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot health care, and today the United States will answer the question, hoping to help friends.
With the increased awareness of people's health care, foot tubs are increasingly loved by consumers, and in the market, there are also a large number of different products, from more than 100 to thousands of yuan of foot tubs, to give consumers a great choice space.
In the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, the health care products such as foot baths sell fire, but the foot baths do not have special industry standards, so there is a certain safety hazard.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!"
Mr. Lee told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath to give his father a birthday present, but when his father blew his foot, he felt numb.
Mr. Li initially thought that it was caused by the vibration function of the foot tub, did not think about the vibration function, the father still felt the foot hemp.
Mr. Lee first tested his laptop, and the laptop was still lit, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find that the water on the foot tub was still carrying electricity.
He later contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was correct, although he retired, Mr. Li was still dissatisfied.
Because he found out that this popular foot bath now has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of setting the highest temperature, which crowds are suitable for, which materials are harmless, etc.
However, under normal circumstances, the foot bath will not have electricity problems, but will not rule out a few products in the factory did not strictly shut down.
Therefore, a split foot bath is selected at the time of purchase.
Hydroelectric separation, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can also take a laptop.

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance for more than 30 years after our loved one's death, especially since I made a call on friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Today, most of the parents of the victims have died, and the widows have also grown up to work as a family.
It's your turn to help us make the most of our difficult times.
The COVID-19 pandemic is raging around the world, and most donors have retired every year.
Therefore, I am eagerly asking you to abort the sufferings of Tiananmen’s Mothers, a humanitarian campaign that should have been perfected long ago.
"And I will remember your love forever, and I will be persuaded that your deeds will be remembered forever."
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please let my friends understand!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Pottery Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of the United States of America (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF) in humanitarian relief for 32 years.
In the process of humanitarian aid, the United States and Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project is often cross-sectoral.
(Apple Daily Photo: Tiananmen Mother's website is managed by Tao industry.)pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Rescue funds are often unable to successfully deliver to the hands of the six four victims.
In 1994, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mother", which unified and responsible for the receiving and distribution of humanitarian funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the June Fourth Orphan Education Fund. After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after graduating from all June Fourth Orphans University, MCDF established the June Fourth Orphan Emergency Relief Fund.
These projects are funded mainly by campus and social contributions from the year of June 4, generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Brother University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour and Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the victims finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong on behalf of the year.
Human Rights in China has also independently implemented its Humanitarian Assistance Program.
We understand that teacher Ding stopped to donate, is for donors to consider, we are indeed some retired elderly people, income is not as abundant as before retirement, thank you for the letter of "friendship" of Ding teacher.
We will respect the decision of the victims, terminate the project within two years and, if necessary, restore it immediately.
We would like to express our gratitude and respect to those who have been generous for many years and are at risk of delivering humanitarian aid.

The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere and two small cats play with each other.
We are working in Beijing, the building of Beijing good points need to queue up half a year in advance, colleagues in Beijing shot, I saw the film just so.
I am looking for a place with a soul in mind.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, I feel that this is also a short version of most people, the photographer bright brother will capture, record the natural wonderful moment.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-design, a fine team.
We, and everyone around us, are unstoppable.
It has been recommended that the honey past, and the honey just looked at the film just as happy.
I hope that this kind of studio should not be buried, and more people find it to be their own style, not a thousand times.
Thank you very much for the five-star review of eagle, Jingling, two are very creative new people, we are creative studio, as long as the customer likes us to complete as much as 200 percent of the strength to complete, thank you for meeting with each other.

How do I make money?

No riders received
The restaurant staff called me.
A program that wants to share personal experiences.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you do not have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself, after all, training will cost a lot of money, and it also takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter the industry, training is a very good choice, especially those who are self-motivated and weak, training is a very good choice.
If you choose to be more self-motivated, you can choose to be more self-motivated, but only more.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, look at the academic strength of the institution, if the academic strength is not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning, of course, some new training institutions of the academic strength is not particularly strong.
Second, before the choice to explore the training institutions, it is best to explore the institutions of students, after all, only the institutions of students know what the institutions are like, the lectures are good or bad.
Hello, I don't really know how to answer this question, because for your own situation does not do a certain presentation, and learning this and your own situation has a great relationship.
For example, professional, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or the computer profession has graduated, then if the time is sufficient, I personally recommend self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, and now a lot of offline training institutions are really good, but a high cost to study, two time more, the basic need to focus on training 3-6 months.
But if I said these things, self-study is very convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the web are free, or b station there are a lot of training resources, if you don't find resources, you can also contact me through a brief introduction to get free resources, or a detailed consultation is also done.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video integrated learning.
If you are not computer professional, but can also pay for some study money and time costs, then it is recommended to go to the training institution to learn, so learning does not need to be expensive, the teacher's explanation is also very detailed, there are problems there are also people special answers, in addition to learning planning or supervision also help.
And now, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are increments, after learning recommended to the company, so after the job search interview section can also save a lot of things.
The above is my opinion, as mentioned above, because you do not understand your situation, so the presentation is only not detailed, if you have other suggestions, you can always contact me for communication.
When I first saw it, I saw it in the app.
What to call
I'm not finished, what are you doing?
I, undertake a variety of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioning, toilets, hobs, hoods, hoods, fixtures, glass towels, professional beauty, home services
Thank you to those who have been silent to me, for their hard work and hard work to live, but to continue.
Life will not live up to every effort of people, like to pay attention to me, thank those who silently praise me.
Life is so, others only see the results, their own support process, the face of life, we in addition to strong, is to continue, do not have the choice, the road can look back but can not go back......
Cleaning is a job, it is also a responsibility, life is beautiful because of the service, the service is wonderful because of the heart.
Although we do the dirty life, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer clean, see the customer satisfaction smile and thumb up, the moment all the accumulation is worth, pay the ultimate return!

It's not a bad thing in all of the industry now!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough to insist, enough to work hard, I will be a little better than others, at least better than always sitting to complain!"
One day is counted in the morning, all the beauty from the beginning of the morning hope you carry happiness, luck, health, if you wish to start the day, to keep a whole day of good mood.
At a young age, happiness is a thing, with happiness; after growing up, happiness is a goal, to achieve happiness; after being mature, found that happiness is originally a mentality, understanding is happiness.
Be the best kind of self, walk according to heart, regret this life; a life of a way, go your own way; life of two jewels: good body, good mood, beautiful and beautiful to live to the old!
There are different challenges in every stage of life.
Sometimes, it's not the ability to hold you back, but the courage to face it.
Since it can't be avoided, it is more straightforward to face.
The more you fear, the more difficult it will be to be defeated; if you meet difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
The first biennial exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua
The first biennial exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia (Reporter Wang Haizhou Hu Guan) was officially opened to the public on December 12 at the Diriejajax Art Zone in northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China.
The biennial exhibition is co-curated by the Saudi Diriye Biennale Foundation and the Chinese UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, and the Chinese UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Chang Tian Fuyu, serves as the Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Touching the Stone River", which metaphorizes the reform strategy adopted during the socio-economic transition period, but also reflects the current situation of the development of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of about 12000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Touching the Stone River", "The Legacy as an experiment", "The Edge of Thinking", "The Beautiful New World" and "The Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of the exhibits, including painting, installation and performing arts in various forms; 12 Chinese artists have the same concerns, some artists use recycled materials in a new way for the creation, such as Xu Bing in the " Behind the Story Series of Creek Mountains" (2014), reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste.
Barkley, CEO of the Diriye Biennale Foundation, said that he hoped that this biennale could establish an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to learn about the vibrant cultural industries and creative communities in Saudi Arabia and strengthen their interactions.
"The goal of the Biennale is to have the Saudi contemporary art involved in the global dialogue, and the Saudi audience into the modern world."
It is understood that during the biennial opening week, a series of lectures will also be held, where artists, curators and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: unified management of public welfare in rural areas - New China Network
On December 12, Xinhua News Agency Kunming (Reporter Lin Bifeng), in order to continue to do a good job of working for the poverty-stricken population, to strengthen and expand the achievements of poverty-stricken, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the revitalization of rural public welfare in rural areas, and to help promote the revitalization of rural areas.
At present, Yunnan has developed 44.83 million rural public welfare posts for the settlement of rural vulnerable groups such as poverty-stricken workers, in order to help the poverty-stricken people to achieve employment gains, strengthen poverty-stricken achievements, and effectively enhance the ability of public services in rural areas.
The new regulations are jointly issued by Yunnan people's society, rural revitalization, finance and other seven departments, mainly on the grassroots recruitment of rural public welfare staff, the scope of funds management, job development, job management and other aspects of unified standard.
In terms of job development and setting up, the new regulations are clearly set up in accordance with the principle of "on-demand employment, hiring people, dynamic management, total control" "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one-person employment, voluntary public and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the procedures of announcements, declarations, audits, publicity, hiring, pre-employment training and arrangement of post-employment.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly specify the rural public welfare job development major responsibilities, rural public welfare job subsidies and subsidies, the rural public welfare job development departments should be rural public welfare job placement personnel to buy accident commercial insurance, the relevant departments regularly on the rural public welfare job subsidies to monitor.

Second, although the right party in the history of the era of ambition, but not long, so the short is because it is wasted to the point of sunshine, drink the point of water to sweat; slightly willing to look forward to Shu, the hit of the beard will be attached.
In fact, the right-wing party has played an active role in the progress of society.
From the end of the cultural revolution to define the standards of truth, the development of economic and technological advancement, and the promotion of administrative system and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right side is not the negative.
Third, in my opinion, although not fully agree with some of the words of Li Weidong, I am very concerned about his statement, and also respect the person Li Weidong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and the social problems of China are also serious about it.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I think that the anti-revolution, revolution will inevitably lead to social upsets, people damaged, political group fisherman mixed mud, and then foreign use.
Fourth, change or improve China to be patient and responsible for the people's attitude, political speculation attempt to pick up the chestnuts, that is not the right, is a mixture.
Talk to the left again.
On the left is a political and political retreat.
If the right has a positive effect on society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right arguments and analyze their thinking when it is necessary, so the left does not make it, because the left is what the Communist Party has thrown away the bad!
5. Recently, I have seen some friends side by side with the anti-terror side, but also move forward, I feel that it is not necessary.
Don't try to explain it to the left or to the right, it's a slippery slope.
Don't try to prove that we are right, or that you don't want to admit that you are right.
And I said to my friends, "When you insult your five hairs, when you insult your right dog, it just proves that our middle path is right."
Many young people also have ideals, but they forget the ideal, or pursue the ideal, but are biased.
And the ideal gradually, and even the massacre of youth to end the evil.
Left and right, I feel that generally refers to the constraints and freedom, and China from the congenital genes of history and culture, resulting in China's overall should be biased.
And the right-wing freedom, focus on efficiency and development, the left-wing strengthening supervision, more focus on fairness and safety.
Today, the general public wants to pay more attention to fairness, while the US-China conflict, the left is positive, and it is estimated to last for many years.
Even if you don't understand it, you are welcome to complete it.
I don't know what to say, it's such a struggle.
In the past two years, the locking and blocking of Huawei chips, not only makes Huawei into an unprecedented dilemma, but also makes the "American System" enterprises suffer huge losses.
China's chip industry pressures itself and allied enterprises to lock down China's chip industry at the same time, the direct result is that the global chip suppliers' orders and profits are affected, resulting in lower R&D investment in chip production enterprises, production capacity declines, resulting in a global shortage of chip supply chains.
Today, the core has been affected by the global industry, such as car enterprises to stop production, mobile phone prices, almost all of the industries used chips have been damaged.
In order to master the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' scientific and technological giants began to "to beautify" the road.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control, dominate the development of China's semiconductor industry, recently the old American motion frequency, is the host of the "chip summit"; is also invited 64 national giants to set up a semiconductor alliance, and subsidize support U.S. domestic scientific and technological giants, such as, Meditate's old-name technology giant Intel in order to regain the dominant position in the chip field, and pay 200 million U.S. dollars in Arizona to build two wafers and factory, and open the chip foundry business.
When most people think that Intel's action will cause a certain impact on TSMC's electricity supply, and it is likely that it will steal the "food bowl" of TSMC's electricity supply.
The reason for this affirmation is that Intel, as a U.S. veteran science and technology giant, has been in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, must be able to quickly rise in the short term, to defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC's founder was reluctant to pay attention to this decision.
At the "2021 Great Master Intelligence Library Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhong said amazingly, for Intel to build a crystal round factory this action, Zhang Zhong was careful and straightforward: Intel to build a chip factory, quite ironic.
The reason why Mr. Zhang is disheartened about Intel's entry into the crystal circle is because Mr. Zhang was still very concerned about the win-win situation of TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
Intel has always been a pearl in the U.S. empire manufacturing industry in the 1970s. The location of the world's peak is the domination of the world's semiconductor industry.
By the 80s, the world semiconductor high-end chips have been mastered by few.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by an IDM model, from design, manufacturing to seals are all done by a factory, Intel is the representative of that era.
However, this model makes some small businesses overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge production line construction costs that can only slow down.
In the sense of market demand, into the 80's, the chip industry began to develop a division of labor, in 1984, Zhongli heard that there is a company dedicated to chip design, since there is a specific design, then you can set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Shortly thereafter, the idea of Mr. Zhang was transformed into reality, and TSMC's electric power came into being.
TSMC's main business aimed at the "crystal wafer processing" this single section, not designed, only the wafer manufacturing of OEM services.
At that time, the power supply was small in front of Intel's huge unbearable.
In order to obtain capital support, Mr. Zhang found Intel's investment, but at that time, Intel heard that Taichuang electric power only the chip industry manufacturing link, obviously some self-esteem is very high, do not look at Taichuang electric power, and suddenly refuse to invest in Taichuang power.
Mr. Zhang also confirmed that Intel was not looking at the crystal round process service at the time.
I don't think the giants who don't look at wafer manufacturing services this year, but now also want to start a wafer foundry.
Therefore, Mr. Zhang felt that Intel entered the crystal round manufacturing is very ironic.
Today, the market value of electricity has surpassed Intel.
In the face of the strong attack of TSMC, Intel naturally does not dare to self-lock.
Today, TSMC has spun its 3nm chip, while Intel is still 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to oversimplify.
Not waiting
To 19:06, place an order for 2 hours 😅
Let's take a look at some of the weird hot spots today.
What is normal behavior?
The random choice of three hot searches: February two dailong head, friend price increase, marathon event, the spread of the wave formation, and then [index drop] (smooth curve) eventually dispersed, if the occurrence of the second life of the phenomenon will have a small peak again.
They seem to be different from the orbital evolution model they have shown.
What is an abnormality?
Choose six heat search of the same event randomly, showing "solitude peak", "shaft silhouette", or "cliff cliff silhouette".
[Lonely peak] that is artificial heating, quickly punching in the heat search, causing public concern; [Shales of teeth] that is cyclical heating, to ensure that the hot search list of the topic; [Scattered cliff] that is collective evacuation, the heat search to complete the "function", received a new mission, to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of an event is just another event of the valley, time is not good seconds, must be a group of navy to take the task, to open a new round of attacks.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches at the same time on the list, which attract attention, which are responsible for science, which lead to war, which shifts the line of view, which influences cognitive, which misconceptions, which incites emotions, which pinpoint decision-making, black accounts batches, section granularization of the battle, almost considering all the elements of the spread of the phenomenon.
Communication is a science, leaving a stand, emotion of all subjective factors, only from objective data, black public relations will be everywhere.
Whenever we have to leave a trace, we will excavate it together.
Data Source: Hot search time machine.
For the first time, Omicron strain infections have been found in countries such as Mauritius.
On December 12, Beijing News Agency reported that for the first time, the Omicron strains of COVID-19 have been found in Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infections in the country for the first time on October 10.
According to a report by Mao's Minister of Health, Kelesh Jagutpal, a person infected with a visitor who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other infected with a local resident of Mauritius, who was in contact with a person who recently returned from South Africa, had a positive nucleic acid test on November 30.
After isolation from the hospital, the results of both nucleic acid tests were negative and have returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cypriot Ministry of Health announced the country's first diagnosis of three Omicron strain infections.
All three of them were students and returned from overseas earlier this month, due to mild illness, and did not attend hospital treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron drug strains, the Sikh government is constantly increasing its anti-control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th, passengers over the age of 12 will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The U.S. Department of Health also announced that it will begin vaccination for children between the ages of 5 and 11 in the country.
Malawi's health minister, Kumbize Chippond, said the country has discovered 3 Omicron strain infections for the first time.
The national health department carried out a genetic sequencing of the 12 novel coronavirus samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and discovered these three cases of infection.

DAILY 360 Integrated Home Furnishings
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Home, No. 156 Huancheng South Road
At first, I was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to look at my initial budget was 70,000 to make a basic renovation.
A series of frauds began in the shop.
The first time I came to the store, I just gave them a look at my house map, they didn't go to the field of the house, they could give me a quote that my 135 houses 70,000 can do, probably to see their materials and I don't know what they are brand material.
Their second set of tricks is that you will drag you to the store to pay the deposit (and once the money has been given you will never go back, unless you have enough experience and they fight theory).
When I doubt whether or not to pay the deposit, they will invite the so-called manager to tell you, you just have to give the deposit today how much we can give you.
This is a big hole, I am the example of life being cheated, and when the brain is impulsed, I give more than 10,000 deposit.
He gave me a lot of questions about 70,000 excluding hydropower transformation, excluding any door and cabinet bathroom, and these three are the cost of the base unit.
The cost of removing these points of service is also higher than other companies.
I lost confidence in the company and didn't say anything at the beginning to let me sign a contract.
When I look for them, they show a very experienced look, and have a dedicated team to deal with you.
In any case, it is the customer's responsibility.
Various pull-down responsibilities, there are many details, do not want to say one by one is all tears, do not choose them in general, because my friend looking for their renovated house is also poor quality, and in the future will give you a variety of expenses.
They are the original bluff decoration, now changed to beautiful, seems to be closed and changed to others.
Therefore, everyone chooses such a boring repair company.
In the future, we will be more than a hundred to look at these consultations, because the renovation is not a small amount.

The weather forecast for the 14th of July is very hot.
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin on December 12 (Journalist Zhou Yunjian), as the last large-scale meteor shower this year, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere will welcome a huge meteor shower on December 14.
Beijing astronomy lover Ankuku shot a pair of meteor showers in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor showers are comets in cycles, but the parent of the pair meteor showers is the 3200th asteroid Faeyun, a Apollo asteroid.
The second meteor shower that is currently known is not a meteor shower that is "born by comets".
Tianjin Astronomy Society director, astronomy science experts to reform the presentation, just like the greeting of the big film, the twins meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, "the release date" can continue from December 4 to 17 days.
The meteor shower is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, along with the quadrant meteor showers and the incense meteor showers.
A significant feature of the twin-seat meteor rain is that the meteor body is slower, rich in color, and the fire meteor is also a lot, both suitable for the visual, but also suitable for astronomy photography beginners for shooting.
The twin-seat meteor shower was shot on December 13, 2020 in Tianjin, China.
The weather forecast shows that this year's twin-seat meteor shower will be about 15 December, when ZHR (in ideal conditions, the number of meteor showers seen every hour when the radiation point is above the top of the head) is 150.
Double-seat meteor shower recommended index map.
“Last year, the twin-seat meteor showers impressed people, but this year, the twin-seat meteor showers will be disturbed by the moon, and the degree of excitement will be a slight discount.
On November 14th, the lunar calendar November 11th, the moon is relatively prosperous, bright moon will cause interference to the observation, so that in the latter half of the moon will fall, at this time the bilateral meteor shower radiation points will also rise higher.
Those who prefer meteor showers can be observed at the hours of the following half-hour after the fall, but beware of the cold and warm weather. '
How can we see more meteors as much as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, in the suburbs or rural areas, you can choose a high altitude, small light pollution, the perspective facing northeast, and then patiently wait until the moon falls, the vision can be observed.
It should be noted that the flow of the twin-seat meteor showers in all directions is very large, and when it is observed, it does not have to stare at the twin-seat meteor shower radiation points.
For those who like to take pictures of the beautiful ' meteor showers', it is best to choose the lens with wide angle and large aperture, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, tripods, spare batteries and shutter lines are also essential.
The reconstruction of the syllogism says.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, traditional TV should refer to LCD TVs, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TVs in market positioning, mainly in the following two points:
First, the laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is significantly more focused on the big screen market, or said that laser TV itself is a product produced for the big screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV is more than 55 inches to 65 inches, and the size of the laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, the largest is more than 100 inches, to fully meet the needs of users for large screen television.
In recent years, the global share of output and sales of laser TV has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of total television sales of 80 inches and above.
In 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140% and continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason why the big screen market has such good results is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in the eye care.
Based on the imaging principle of the laser TV diffusion, the light generated by the laser light source is not directly into the eye, compared to the back light of the LCD TV, the imaging process closer to the natural conditions of the object imaging process, the stimulation of the eye is also less.
China's Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute Sixi Laboratory and Beijing Concord Hospital ophthalmology experts, through the same conditions of the population to watch the strict comparison test of laser TV and LCD TV, resulting in 144 sets of test data.
Data shows that laser TV does have a strong eye protection properties, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
In view of the growing importance of vision health, laser TV not only attracts more and more users, but also opens another breakthrough in the color control market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the constant price of LCD TVs, the price of the current marketed laser TVs is mostly more than a million dollars, with the upgrading of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
What's the price of a cable TV?
It is certainly justified.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, there are many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is shorter compared to traditional projectors, and it can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, which requires little space, and the host is small and occupy little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
The heating capacity is lower, the equipment is less damaged, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and other cutting-edge technology, which can bring a more shocking audio-visual experience to users.
Not to talk about the false demand, but the demand for detailed products, the quality of the pictures and input ratio, laser TV is not a video player's dish, I want to take the large screen and watch the environment is insufficient, you can try, everything has advantages and disadvantages, weigh their own judgment, afraid to listen to the words.
Simply put, the ultra-wide angle near-focus projector - the laser TV, in order to stick to the near-screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lens and reflector, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of a microstructure of the curtain, high cost, 80 inch price can basically replace a 65 inch liquid crystal.
Also, I especially like the projector manufacturers to bring in the reflection of the eyes of such a point of sale, byto, the light on the eyes can be seen on the curtains for the eyes is direct light, you are reflective to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, not more real LCD TV is also "direct", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Also, the projection screen does not look like a mirror if it is not a diffuse reflection.
Ignoring the hot spots (spots) effect of the high-gain curtain, a large amount of light reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, that is really difficult.
The quality of the shopping cart is not available at the moment.
With the WeChat appointment date, the lady sent me the option to schedule the time, the response information is relatively timely.
Before going to the shop to see the shooting work, more is the outdoor wedding dress, the shooting is very beautiful, it involves a lot of shooting style.
After that day, she and her sister simply exchanged their ideas, and very patient to help me try two sets of my settled style clothes, and finally decided to start makeup styling ~ photographer will put some props before shooting, will guide action, and the details are more refined.
But maybe it's because I don't have a specific photography idea, so it's not the style I want to take out, but it should be nice 🙊
The photographer will help to select the photos, exchange the later style, and feel very careful.
It takes about a month and a half to get the effect.
For the second time in the photo class, most of the clothes can choose one shot.
Finally, we chose a black dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, make-up + shoot, responsible for shooting photographer is 95 after the brother, feel a little or a little green, I hope to give more suggestions after the customer shooting action guide, the shooting process is more enjoyable.
A selection of quality photography services
Go to the top of the page and see Queenie.
Before you go to the store, fill in the name phone and then select clothing, wedding dress can be selected, in exchange for three or four sets of clothing and also be patient, after the selection of makeup for a long time, the service attitude is also good, after the shooting will teach you how to style, is the feeling of shooting is very big, refined said to be half a month, three and four days have been sent, feel as if there is no difference from the original film
The environment is good overall.
There are a lot of clothes to choose from.
There are about three spots for makeup, and there is a photo booth on the side.
The service is very warm and attentive.
The stylist is patient.
The photographer will also take you seriously.
Dissatisfaction, the photographer will also make a follow-up.
[Experimental] It may be a bit slippery, and the original double eyelid is covered with three eyelid.
The eyebrows were also shaved, and it was a bit annoying for the day.
The photo has been given for 10 days, but the effect of the picture is not satisfied, I feel that the two eyes paste are very obvious.
Since it is unclear what style to try two sets of results to pick up or choose a black dress, Mrs. said that this set is compared to Hepburn's vintage style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to make make up hairdresser and cosmetic lady are all super patient in helping me to do the effect of very satisfied.
The whole process of taking a picture of the photographer was very easy for me.
After the auction, he carefully selected the four favorite refining brothers said within 15 pieces, the ending is very satisfied ~
I haven't responded in 3 days...I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system doesn't recognize my credit card!
The most surprising thing is that I use the same credit card every time I make a payment.
I'm going to pay the shipping fee every now and then.
Can I get exempt from my monthly fee until you have investigated it?
Do you want to buy a small amount of rain insurance?
Small rainstorm is an internet insurance broker platform.
From the setting conditions: In accordance with the Insurance Agency Regulation (Revised in 2015), to become an insurance broker company, we must meet the three key words: shareholders, promoters for the last 3 years with no major violations record, the minimum limit is RMB 5 million before it can be established, must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three articles are actually very harsh, in summary, to have the strength, to be approved by the national authority of the bank insurance board (supervised national insurance companies, banks), shareholders to have a good style, as insurance broker companies small rain insurance, insurance brokers do not need to question too much about the small rain insurance is normal or not, after all, there are these three doors, not what insurance companies can achieve.
In this regard, it is trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Xiaomu is a supermarket insurance, many companies of star serious illness are sold on this platform, such as the latest and Tai Super Mary 5 serious illness, legal claims and insurers are all live in Taitai, Xiaomu insurance is just a third-party intermediary, do not have to question its masculine nature.
From the point of view of the pay model: the Internet platform products, because of the lack of business network operating costs, and the cost of staff salaries, so the general cost of Internet products is relatively high, and the pay method is flexible, support monthly pay, reduce the insured's pay pressure, while at the same time to maximize the leverage of the insured's insurance.
This point is very correct.
Can be considered.
From the professional point of view of the business: this is especially important, because insurance is a professional requirement very strong industry, many Internet product customers can insure themselves, which will have a lot of mistakes, health information and career, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when in insurance, feel healthy or fit, so easily there are many claims risk of rejection.
I have done insurance phone sales, just like a small rainstorm, and it is also the Internet insurance broker platform, and I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true, it is also a mirror, not a mirror is people, the Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are a lot of sales errors.
For example: 1 yuan insurance six million, to buy insurance to send a mobile phone, free to collect 60,000 serious illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not right, but to avoid the burden of light, will not tell the insured, the first month 1 yuan, the next month needs to be charged according to the normal fee, a few to 200, many customers with a two-year charge is not clear.
Think you can spend 1 piece of money, insurance company compensation 6 million (dropped biscuits in the sky).
Free mobile phone, is the end of the policy, such as 6666,8888 such special policy sent only, and if the winning SMS sent, they do not exchange, and no one to remind.
(This is for the insured, it is another pit) free to collect 60,000 serious illness insurance, is short-term, if only this, there is no other commercial risks, in the event of serious illness, 60,000 can do well, can not solve the problem, the future life began to run bare.
At present, there is a serious misunderstanding about the sale of Internet insurance.
So overall, the platform is no problem, the product is no problem, the problem is the professional and professional ethics of the staff.
Suggested topics are carefully considered, in fact, a lot of offline insurance brokerage companies have a wide range of products, customers can choose the opportunity and products more, some products are more cost-effective than the Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, covered offline products, and the premium saved 2000-3000 yuan per person per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
I: Mingya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of enterprise management and training experience, service nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will start from the customer's needs, for the customer to customize insurance products, insurance, for the customer more than three, to do the best for the customer to seek the best underwriting results, after insurance, for the customer to do a policy sorting, insurance hosting, so that customers worry-free.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope that my answer will be helpful to the topic!
According to the definition of insurance supervision department, the Internet insurance is the insurance business of the insured can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need a signature, the insurance consultant does not need a signature, all steps can be done independently by the insured.
Although the insurance of the Internet insurance does not have a "ceremonial sense", it may even have a printed version of the paper contract is not, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model, somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" general pipeline operation, but such purchasing insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is - the subsequent service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract of up to a few decades, when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about it, the "intermediate" we choose, is it a "insurance intermediaries" that can be with us for a long time, and many years later will also provide us with services?

No problem, remember that there is no need to reschedule, I have purchased another, I don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help
Since then, I have been opposed to any form of defamation and slander, and I can't accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can embrace everything, but it is to eliminate such a villain.
If you don't see political parties and factions, you must first resist, which is the uncivilized style.
From the moment you start sending a request for a friend, post an ad-hoc post, and then you try to post the so-called home location and father's name on social media, I have already taken an unresponsive attitude.
After your changes, not only according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also with your so-called friends on the face and continue to talk about some hidden, humiliating statements about my appearance, body shape, good nutrition, what kind of strawberries on the bed, do not insert comments, I...
How do you know I've received a number of friends to upload a comment about your photos and sexually harassing ingredients on your Facebook friend's account.
I'm sorry, but as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After the news of my alarm was uploaded, you did not receive anything at all, but more and more frequent.
I don't understand what political background you are, no matter what your status is, in our society, we need gender respect.
Yes, you can continue to use this tactical, implicit, humiliating, humiliating statement, and you can continue to say that you care and care about me, you can continue to think that it is not troubling, you can even deny that it is not your image, or you can continue to publish all offensive statements.
I can't, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I neither know you, nor do I want to know you, nor do I need your opinion.
I don't even know what kind of girl I want to be so humiliated.
My friend asked, "Is it better?"
I'm not saying you won't believe me.
I don't think any of the girls would be able to feel that way again.
Whether at work, in society, in politics, or in the business world, only those who have no basic morals can choose to use this way to harm any woman.
I believe that justice is in the heart.
I cut out some of the comments to everyone.
Your self-esteem shouldn't allow anyone to take advantage of you.
All I can say is that you are an enemy of civilization.

The U.S.-sanhang mistress gathers the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam 2022-01-17 Dovid Migrant Media Dovid reported: The latest satellite image shows that three U.S. mistresses are consolidating around China; U.S. media also discloses that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arms library is rare to visit Guam, releasing important signals to allies and enemies of the U.S. in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to China's intelligence library "South China's strategic situation perception platform," on January 9, satellites found the USS "Carvinson" (USS Carl Vinson) mother ship near the Barabbas Strait.
The Barabbas Strait connects the South China Sea and the Suzuki Sea and is a strategic gateway to the First Island of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the F-35C fighter jet and the CMV-22 "fish eagle" carrier.
Now a U.S. naval navigator, in addition to the "Kar Vincent" number, and the "USS Abraham Lincoln" number from the U.S. on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" was also the first time the F-35C pilots were deployed, which was the 314th fighter jet attack squad of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the above aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia Pacific region and the USS Ronald Reagan is still standing on the Japanese plane.
The navy fighter groups also included the "Sampland Lake" missile cruiser, the "Stockdale" missile launcher, etc.
On January 17, 2022, "South China's strategic situation perception platform" released the latest satellite picture, showing that the three U.S. mistresses are converging around China.
(Microblogging@South China's strategic situation perception) U.S. Sanhang mother gathers the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam on January 17, 2022, the U.S. Navy carrier CMV-22B flight route.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's stockpile was rarely visited in Guam last weekend, according to the U.S. Cable Television News Network (CNN) on January 17.
The Ohio-level nuclear submarine with 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear bombs, the U.S.S.S.S. Nevada, sailed into the U.S. Guam Marine Base on Saturday (January 15).
The U.S.-sanhang mother gathered around China's most powerful weapons with rare access to Guam, said it was a signal to allies and enemies in an increasingly stressful situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
It was the first American ballistic submarine to visit Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 80s.
U.S. Sanhang mother gathers the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam China in recent years to build a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands.
China's permanent summer island in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-level nuclear submarine "Neerda" strengthened cooperation between the U.S. and the region's allies, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, state of war, and ongoing commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
The ballistic submarine is commonly referred to as the Boomer submarine.
The track of 14 "Rachel Submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet is usually strictly confidential.
The secret behind the ballistic missile submarines makes the "Rade Submarine" the most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity, which also includes well-launched ballistic missiles located in the U.S. territory, as well as rockets that carry nuclear bombs such as B-2 and B-52.
With a recent meta drop of 26% and a surge of $2510 billion in market capitalization, Zuckerberg responded to the "previous competition" why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is a real advertising company, mainly from advertising, today's money-making advertising company, is a mobile channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and more, regardless of the function, are all Meta traffic channels.
Not only that, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps external to Meta ads, through Meta's advertising platform is to achieve transformation.
But the time has changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is no longer difficult to get the user's data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it's clear whether or not users allow apps to access their own information, and most people's normal response is certainly not allowed.
If Google has a knife, it will have a greater impact on Meta's revenue.
Second, the Chinese factor in previous Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain how high, but it does exist).
We all know that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of the income comes from China, mainly from companies that do business by sea.
Meta has hundreds of offices in Hong Kong, with several agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is the only advertising channel, and most of the burning money is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is one of the main competitors of Meta, but the first two years of Meta have made a lot of money from the byte.
All of the agents in the country are advertising in the link section of Meta, and the performance of Meta in the Greater China region is also very good.
I haven't had a clear understanding recently, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
China's large-scale company burns money overseas.
Third, the new flow channel expansion is not satisfactory.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not only looking at income, but more importantly, looking at the future.
Clearly, the expectation is not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke about the "metaverse."
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the metaverse has a longer cycle of implementation, and the story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in these two or three years.
In the next two years, it will be a more difficult time.
