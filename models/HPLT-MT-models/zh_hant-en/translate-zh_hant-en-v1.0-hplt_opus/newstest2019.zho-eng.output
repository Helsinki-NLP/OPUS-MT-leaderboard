According to the British media, the U.S. Navy's Deputy Secretary of War William Moran will say that even if the U.S. Navy is reinvigorating so that the U.S. will continue to expand the region to include the Indian-Asian-Pacific region as the focus of the Navy, even if the U.S. Navy is reinforcing its strength to deal with the increasingly disturbing Russia on both sides of the Atlantic.
On September 24, the United States released a new defense strategy in the United Kingdom, China and Russia as a strategic competitor.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has resumed its second fleet in order to fight Russia more directly.
These initiatives sparked doubts and concerns among allies and analysts who feared that the U.S. Navy might stay away from the Obama administration's "Asia Pacific Rebalancing" strategy.
However, the United States Navy's focus remains on the West Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at a round table discussion in Washington, D.C., the National Asian Studies Agency, he said, "There was no significant change for us."
"The focus is still on balance, focus shift, or whatever you want to describe it."
He noted that the relationship between the United States and the United States is very close.
"We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do," he said.
Although Moland pointed out that the overall policy of Russia belongs to the U.S. Department of Defense, he warned: "Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but historically, it proves that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough."
As part of the U.S.'s efforts to combat Russia, China, and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying its troops as a "new combat mode," which will help keep opponents out of the U.S. naval battles or other assets at any given time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and naval forces support it - the concept of war is unpredictable, and we should not appear again and again in the same place, almost like a rule - that's how we do it."
The first attempt to this new practice was the "Harry Dulumen" Marine Battalion, the early deployment of which included a work visit to the port and a patrol usually only through the area.
At present, the U.S. Navy is working to ensure that allies know that these ships will still be patrolled in traditional regions, and that they will also address logistic and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
The Australian Navy commander of the Royal Navy, Michael Nuan, will also speak at the event, saying that the Australian army could cooperate with the U.S. navy-fighting group.
He said that as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more escort ships equipped with the "Zeus Shield" as a combat system, this situation will continue.

Japan's ITOCHU business on Friday recognized the loss of $13 billion in value-added shares in China, due to the impact of China and the U.S. trade tensions on its largest corporate investment transactions.
In May 2016, a man from Tokyo, Japan, walked through Maruhong Corporation headquarters.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has suspended its financial transactions in terms of agriculture, according to Maroon.
Previously, some heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies in Japan announced the latest performance, has warned the impact of trade friction between the United States and China, and today, these Japanese trade companies have also joined the line.
U.S. and China tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of goods mutual tariffs, U.S. President Trump threatened, if the dispute could not be resolved, to expand the scope of taxation to more than 50 billion U.S. dollars of Chinese inflation goods.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Chief Financial Officer of ITOCHU, said that next year's trade dispute could have a greater impact on China's economy.
In 2015, Itochu Business and Thai Pompeo Group invested US$1 billion to earn 20% of their equity interest in CITIC.
According to Hachimura, ITOCHU has lost 1.43 billion yen (US$13 billion) in this part of the holding, as it believes that the stock price of CITIC will not rise in the near future.
Itochu Business maintains a profit forecast for the financial year ended March 31, 2019 at 50 billion yen.
In July, China imposed 25% import tariffs on American soybeans to counter the Chinese government's measures in trade friction.
"Our grain business has been hit by trade friction in the United States and China," said Mr. Maruhong's chief financial officer.
He said the financial transactions in his own account have been suspended since September.
A spokesperson for the company Pat Burke said in a statement on Friday that the move was "in accordance with internal policy restrictions and lack of market opportunities."
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions will not lead to a reduction in employment.
Maruhong maintains an annual profit estimate of 239 billion yen, which is supported by papermaking and power generation businesses.
The home-buying business announced a 16% increase in earnings between April and September, highlighting "the trade issues between the U.S. and China have led to uncertain prospects."

Mitsubishi has also announced a new business plan, aiming to raise the profit of the financial year as of March 31, 2022 from the estimated 6,400 billion yen this year to 9 billion yen ($79.8 billion).
On November 5, a comprehensive report of the United States mid-term election has been indicted.
On November 4, President Trump and the Democratic Party fought with their core voters to "go vote".
Both parties noted that the voter turnout rate would be the key to the election.
Trump was busy at the Republican candidate's position 48 hours before the U.S. public vote, while former President Obama went to Indiana to vote for Joe Donnelly, the presidential candidate for the Democratic House of Representatives, and shouted to the crowd the final appeal before the election.
On November 4, Trump went to Mayau, Georgia to host the Republican presidential candidate, Brian Kemp, who said, "You have to go to the polling place on Tuesday and you have to vote."
"It is impossible for this election to be more clear than it is."
Voters' political enthusiasm rises to rare peaks, with early voting in some states far beyond usual.
Former U.S. Presidents face the first half of the election, and the number of seats in the political party is often reduced.
According to the Washington Post and ABC News, while the Democratic House elections remain a positive side, Republicans can benefit from the economic assessment and Trump's serious concerns about border security, according to a new civic censorship released on 4th of the Washington Post and ABC News.
Voters prefer the Democratic House of Representatives more than the Republicans, with 50% to 43% compared to August's leading 14 percentage points.
Another referendum by the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also shows that Democrats are still ahead of the Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is reported that Obama said to the crowd in the legislature of Donoly: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there must be evil consequences."
Democracy can't work when people can only lie to themselves in a self-deprecating way. '
"The only way to stop these Republicans now is by you and your vote."
The Democratic Party has faced the most difficult election in decades in the Senate, and currently has more than 51 seats in the Republican Party.
But the House of Representatives is more favourable, and the Democratic Party needs to win 23 more seats to take control of the House of Representatives with 435 seats.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com predict that the Democratic Party will win as much as 85% of the House of Representatives.

In the same way, many science and technology enterprises in the patent technology licensing, patent technology use and other aspects encountered a small amount of infringement wave.
At the end of 2017, the three people from Guangdong province relying on patent infringement, the developer of the app Beijing Xiaoshuo Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoshuo Technology), the operator of Didi Travel Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Travel), and the seller of the Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Guangdong Pacific) complained to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
Three Plaintiffs appealed to the court that three defendants immediately ceased to manufacture, sell, promise to sell, and use the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Magistrates' Network released a "copyright infringement lawsuit with Beijing Xiaoyang Technology Co., Ltd. and other intellectual property infringement lawsuits", revealing some of the details of the case in which the app was prosecuted for patent infringement.
The Plaintiff believes that the patent owner and inventor of the patent-based carpooling service system and method based on the mobile terminal, and the entire operation process of the "Window" application in the "Die trip" APP corresponds to the patent protection technology program, which constitutes patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Xiaomei believes that the Oriental Pacific is not a suitably Defendant, which only provides a free download on the network of the case involving APP "Die Travel", does not implement the patent method involved in the case, there is no direct or indirect infringement behavior, should not be listed as the defendant in this case.
Second, the case is not in the east.
In accordance with the law, the infringement of the patent involving the case should be the place where the patent involving the case should be fully implemented, therefore, the jurisdiction of the court proposed objections, requiring that the case be transferred to the defendant's place of residence court, the Beijing Court of Intellectual Property.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court believes that Defendant provided the app on its network platform for alleged infringement. Plaintiff listed Defendant as Defendant.
And the defendant is located in Guangzhou City, which is within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.

Other cases of the case have not yet been reported, and journalists will closely monitor the follow-up details of the patent infringement case of Didi Travel.
Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Research Institute for Science and Industry: Significant achievements in Australia-China scientific and technological cooperation
“ Chinese science and technology has developed rapidly in the past few decades, and the two countries in Australia and China work together in the field of science and can achieve fruitful results. ”
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Australian Federal Research Institute for Science and Industry, said in an interview with reporters from China News Agency in Beijing that from responding to climate change to co-operation in the "Skyscraper" project, Australia's cooperation in the science and technology sector showed a booming vitality.
As the largest national research institute in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and more.
CSIRO maintains close cooperation with scientific research institutes such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's a long-lasting friendship that contains the tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with our partners," Marshall said.
In May of this year, China's 500-meter spherical radio telescope - "China's sky eye" installed the world's first 19-band L-band receiver.
This is currently the most advanced 19 wave feed receiver in the world, jointly developed by China and Australia scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on the CSIRO years of technology accumulation, after the activation, the FAST cruising speed will be increased by 5 to 6 times, at the same time, will expand more scientific and visual goals.
"This is the power of CSIRO to contribute to FAST."
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO is also building a km2 telescope, research and development of new fuel technology, energy conservation and other aspects of cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions.
"In the past, scientific research was often focused on problems over a hundred years later, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems in front of us."
Marshall believes that the two countries in Australia are complementary in the field of scientific development, while the two countries face a series of challenges in the development.
Extreme weather, such as global frequency, drought and flooding, has caused food shortages, and food shortages have severely affected human development.
At the same time, population explosions, ageing, chronic diseases and other problems are also a serious challenge.
"In recent years, the cooperation between the two countries in Australia and China has focused mainly on solving these current problems."
Marshall said that CSIRO and Qingdao Ocean Science and Technology National Laboratory jointly established the International Southern Hemisphere Ocean Research Center, its focus is to observe the phenomenon of El Niño and La Nina phenomenon, study the relationship between the two extreme weather, and establish a warning facility for extreme weather; CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly developed to overcome the new grains of extreme weather, can also alleviate the food shortage caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete independently, it requires a very high cost, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is especially important today."
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs, which is also the meaning of strengthening cooperation under the framework of "one Belt and one Road" between the two sides in Australia and China.
“Strengthening bilateral cooperation is a technology-focused collaboration for us. ”
Marshall, for example, CSIRO has developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, and many countries would like to find a method for reducing environmental pollution.
“We are willing to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the results we have achieved in our partnership with the Belt and Road Initiative. ”

On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Li Yonghao said the United Nations would continue to impose sanctions to deepen North Korea's distrust of the United States, and North Korea would not be able to give up nuclear weapons on its own under such circumstances.
Mr. Lee said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has adopted a "very friendly approach" in the past year, including stopping missiles and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and committed not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we didn't see any response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we have no confidence in the security of our country, and in such a case, we can't give up our weapons on our own."
Although Mr. Lee has repeatedly complained about North Korea's "stage-by-stage" denuclearization of the United States, his speech is of great significance because there was no single denuclearization of the country as before.
Lee Yonghao mentioned Kim Jong-un and Trump's joint statement on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," and Trump promised to protect the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The U.S. has also declined to lift its sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclearization' and increases sanctions pressure to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even rejects the declaration of the end of the war," Lee said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us kneel down for forgiveness is that we don't know who our people are dreaming daydreams.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our distrust.
Lee Yonghao did not mention the United States President's second Special Fund meeting earlier this week.
On the contrary, he emphasized Kim Jong-un and Korea's President's speech at a three-time meeting in the past five months, saying: "If the other side of denuclearization is Korea, not Korea, then denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so rigid."
China announced the reduction of import tariffs for 1585 purposes from November 1, 2018.
Since then, China has been actively reducing tariffs on imports.
On May 1, this year, the total tax reduction of drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, all ordinary drugs and anti-cancer drugs, the actual import of proprietary Chinese medicines and other 28 purposes of import tariffs to zero.
At the same time, it also significantly reduces the production of anti-cancer drugs, imports of value-added tax.
On July 1, 218 vehicles and parts were taxed.
After tax cuts, China's vehicle-wide vehicle tax rate is lower than the average level of developing Chinese people, in line with the actual Chinese automotive industry.
This tax reduction will promote industrial structure adjustment and resource optimization, accelerate the success of the fittest, help to improve the quality of products and services, is expected to promote the price adjustment of the car to a certain extent, so that consumers more affordable.
On July 1, 1449 consumer goods tax was reduced.
The daily consumption tax reduction is related to the good life of the people.
This tax cut is not only a large number, but also a large amount, with an average tax cut of 56%.
The daily use of consumer goods tax reduction directly benefits a large number of consumers, and promotes the domestic industry to improve competitiveness.
On November 1, 1585 industrial products such as machinery and equipment, parts and raw materials will be reduced.
It is appropriate to reduce the import tariffs of some of the most urgent domestic industrial products, can attract more foreign capital, is conducive to the increase of domestic effective supply, to help industrial upgrading, while helping enterprises allocate resources globally, reduce production costs, but also conducive to reducing the pressure on domestic environmental bearing.
The Office of the Tariffs Commission of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the above four independent reductions, and the third step reductions in the implementation of the results of negotiations in accordance with the information technology agreement on July 1 this year, will reduce the total level of tariffs in China from 9.8% to 7.5% last year.
The adjusted tariffs are slightly higher than the EU, lower than most developing Chinese, is at a moderately low level, and the development of China's domestic status and development stage is basically matched.
The responsible person introduces that the total level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of the openness of China's trade in goods, should be in line with the economic development stage of China, reflecting the characteristics of the times.
China's goods trade is the world's number one and already has a further expansion of the economic basis, but there is still a gap in the quality and efficiency of trade development compared to the developed economy, so it should be appropriate to reduce the overall level of tariffs.
Tariffs should be in line with the competitiveness of the industry, to encourage a good competition, to protect excessively not conducive to industrial development and improve the quality.
The tariffs should be adjusted to meet the needs of production and consumption.
Focus on reducing the domestic demand and helping the transformation of the industry to upgrade the commodity tax rate, and strive to increase the population's demand more centralized import of the characteristics of the advantage products, and constantly enhance the sense of corporate and public access to meet the needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure of the upgrading.

The President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
According to the news from the General Office of the President of the Republic of Serbia, in view of the Gazebo Voda Hydropower Station located in northern Kosovo under the control of Belgrade, the President of Serbia ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest state of war.
On September 29, Minister of State of Serbia, Wulin, declared that the Serbian army has entered a state of full-fledged warfare.
Wulin stressed that as long as the orders issued by Wuchuch are still valid, Serbia will continue to maintain the monitoring of the current situation in Kosovo, regardless of the situation in which the situation develops, the sergeant will respond.
According to the Russian Tashkent News Agency, on September 29, he said in an interview that he had communicated the current situation with the U.S. and Europe, and will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 2 to seek support from Putin in Kosovo.
When asked if Serbia needed military support like Syria, Wuggenheim gave a negative answer: "I don't want to have a major military conflict in our territory."
Wuchuch also said that the Iraqi forces entered the state of Total War just to form a deterrent to stop conflict, but this is also a clear warning: there is absolutely no tolerance for violent acts in Kosovo.
The sergeant has raised the state of war, which is related to two major initiatives in Kosovo.
According to Serbia, the Albanian people have recently been ragingly arresting the Serbian people living in the northern region of Kosovo, who have not breached any laws.
Since the arrests and seizures of the Kosovo military forces by Mr. Marco Yorich, head of the Kosovo and Metoshia offices in Serbia on March 26, the ethnic group has been increasing and carrying out unmanned arrests and deportations against the ethnic groups.
In addition, more than 100 of the ROSU Special Forces, Armed Police and Snipers of the Republic of Kosovo, which were officially announced recently, occupied the shores of the gaziwoda hydroelectric power station near the water lake, entered the ecological and sports center near the Tivoli in the northern Kosovo region, and blocked all nearby roads, which were previously controlled by Serbia.
Mr. Wuchuchuch said that the military adventures of Kosovo were carried out under the influence of the Western countries, and the actions of the Kosovo army did not inform Serbia in advance, in violation of Article 9 of the Brussels Agreement, but also violated the UN Security Council resolution 1244 and the military technical agreements between Seco.
Wroclaw has called NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg to criticise the falsehoods of Western countries on the topic of Kosovo.
The root cause of this conflict remains a centuries-old resentment between the two countries of the Kosovo region.
The genocide of Kosovo, the Cypriots and the Aristocrats each had their own sayings.
The Serbian people view Kosovo as the nation's birthplace and cultural cradle, as Serbia established its strongest country here in the 12th century, and the Aristocrats were only able to enter a great deal after the Ottoman invasion and the defeat of the Serb army in the north.
The Aborigines insisted that the original tribe of Ilyria, inhabited in Kosovo in the 4-5th century B.C., was the ancestors of the Aborigines, and that Kosovo had been the territory of the Aborigines since ancient times.
The political dispersion has led to intense conflict between ethnic, religious and cultural groups, and has led to intense opposition between the Sikhs and the Arabs in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo people first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of the Aborigines living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, the proportion of the Aborigines rose relatively, in the Aborigines seemed to "just take back their own land" practice, but was regarded by the Aborigines as the "Greater Serbianism," the two ethnic contradictions were radical.
Kosovo became a "drug barrel" in Balkans.
In 1999, the Albanian separatists in the Republic of Kosovo were armed with Serbian forces and police, causing the NATO to bomb on the southern unions formed by Serbia and Montenegro.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia.
Since then, despite the news that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo, and sign a global and legally binding agreement, but due to the historical national embarrassment and geopolitical interference, the agreement cannot be signed due to the multi-strength forces such as the United States and Europe.
And a month ago, the first time that the Sikhs in Kosovo explicitly stated that the Sikhs separated from the Arabs in Kosovo, and once again opened the two contradictions.

Reuters Brussels, September 28 - The European Union may take a more aggressive stance on Italy after depreciating the market with a large budget deficit plan in Italy on Friday, but if Italy insists on its ambitious goal, it may be more aggressive.
The goal of the Italian government is to budget deficit is equivalent to 2.4 per cent of GDP in the next three years, which indicates that there is still no debt reduction in the face of the deficit requirement.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the European Commission and Italy," the European Commission's economic affairs commission said Friday, "because the recommendations and sanctions of the European Union may have no effect on Italy, he took caution to respond."
The European Union officials and diplomats are still hoping that the market power will convince Italy to adjust its budget until it is officially submitted to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell to the lowest level in the past two weeks, while the Italian bond yield reached its highest in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the end of October, the European Commission may reject the Italian budget draft, which has never been done by the Commission for any country.

However, he did not say it would cause the EU to respond.

We believe that countries can work together in harmony and exchange knowledge.
No matter the past, present or future, China will neither follow the pattern of foreign countries, nor will it require other countries to copy China's practices.

Despite the lack of details, the above significant progress has led Mexico and the U.S. government to suddenly stop issuing a text of the trade agreement, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a Mexican candidate, told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government has made new objections to the Government of Canada, saying he will continue to urge all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexico's Minister of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo said that the time for submitting the U.S.-China trade agreement to Mexico and the U.S. legislation was deferred because the Canadian and U.S. governments "seriously" tried to reach an agreement.
Guadaldo said, "In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we are going to reach a text of a three-party agreement or have to announce the text of a text of the agreement between the two parties."
Guadaldo said his U.S. and Canadian equivalent officials "special requests" deferred the release of the text.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative Office (USTR) has not commented on the text of the U.S.-China Trade Agreement and the U.S.-Canada consultation.
The Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs have not responded to a request for comment on the objection.
According to the external media, in a conservation center in the suburbs of Pretoria, South Africa, the two little lions play together, it is difficult to see any unusual thing, but they really have nothing.
The University of Pretoria announced: "It's always the first to see an artificial insemination--the world's first pair."
In-school scientists are working on the reproductive system of African lions.
The two young lions, who were born on August 25, are relatively healthy and normal, said Gans Winter, director of the Institute of Mammals at the University of Pretoria.
After 18 months of intensive testing, the team finally reached this milestone.
In an interview with the media, Gants Winter said: "We collect sperm from a healthy lion."
Next, when the level of hormonal content in the mother body of the researchers and other researchers to the appropriate extent, for it to be artificially insemination.
Gants Winter said: "Good luck with the results. '
He said the researchers "had tried several times, but unexpectedly, they didn't spend too much energy."
He said the above research breakthroughs can be repeated, and scientists are hoping to use this technology to save the lives of large cats.
Lions have been extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of surviving wild lions has declined by 43 percent in the past 20 years, with only about 20,000 remaining.
African lions are classified as endangered animals by the organization.
"If we don't do something about this kind of animal, they'll face an insect," Gants Winter said.
He said that this new technology does not have to allow lions to feed, but only by injecting sperm into the fertile mother lion body, just as North America and Europe have done to the captive elephants.
South Korea's export decline in September has been the biggest in more than two years, but analysts have attributed the decline to fewer working days, and said that the demand for goods in South Korea is still strong despite the rising tensions in China-US trade.
In fact, the number of exports has increased in the past month.
In addition, the preliminary data released earlier showed that exports had increased by two numbers in the first few weeks of September before a long holiday.
South Korea's exports have fallen the largest year-on-year drop since July 2016, which is greater than the expected drop by 5.7 percent from 11 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
The initial price announced on Monday showed that the exports in September were US$506 million, lower than US$512 billion in August.
Despite the growing concern over the growing U.S.-China trade dispute that could lead to other dependence on exports of Chinese neighbors, South Korea increased exports by 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the 23rd month.
South Korea's U.S. exports declined 11.8 percent, due to a decline in oil product sales.
Korea's memory chip and oil products overseas sales have increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, although the market is concerned that the so-called "supercycle" chip may have reached the top.
"However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid, as exports from South Korea are heavily dependent on the U.S. and China markets."
The imports declined by 2.1% to US$408 billion, not as Reuters estimates increased by 3.1 percent.
The initial trade surplus was $9.7 billion, up from $69 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that the U.S. and European Union countries will continue to contribute to the global manufacturing industry, which is a favorable factor for exports from South Korea.
"The increase in export prices caused by oil prices will also be beneficial for exports in the second half of this year," the statement said.
"But the trade conflicts between the United States and China continue, coupled with the increasing market volatility following the rise of the United States, are the negative pressures faced by exports."
On average, exports per working day in September increased to US$26 billion and US$21 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, less than four days in the same period last year.
South Korea's exports increased by 4.7 percent from the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei / Markit Procurement Manager Index, Korean manufacturing activities in September rebounded, but supported by domestic orders, because orders from China and Japan fell, which is afraid that the prospect of additional exports will be shackled.
North Korea's media criticises U.S. non-relaxing sanctions
On September 30, Korea's Labor News published a review article criticizing the U.S. against the sanctions while seeking a dialogue, saying it was a "contradictory" practice.
The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on the 14th that "to achieve the unnuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the key is to meet the sanctions against the Korean Peninsula," emphasizing that the United States' position to continue to comply with the United Nations sanctions resolution remains unchanged.
In the joint statement of the United States and the United States, the two sides pledged to establish a new United States-American relationship with the people of the United States and the people of the United States looking forward to a peaceful and prosperous desire to adapt.
There is no doubt that the U.S. will increase the pressure on sanctions and demand a dialogue, which is contradictory.
According to the article, if you want to establish a new symmetrical relationship, to build a permanent peace system in the Korean peninsula, and to achieve the full nuclearization of the Korean peninsula, you should put the construction of trust first, from the start of what can be done, to solve it in a one-stage basis.
The U.S. should also be aware that sanctions against North Korea are not binding.
The article says that even the "Northern Devon" before the "Kasan" is a tribute to the U.S. military.
The National Interest magazine cites the US Navy point of view: "We will meet a strong potential opponent. Just look at the North Devon's submarine enough."
The U.S. Army's current commander-in-chief of the European Navy, Fugo, also praised the Northern Devinsk submarine.
"The submarine is impressive," he said. "Look at the development of the Russian Navy and how resources are used, and the main efforts it makes in research and development are first to strengthen the submarines."
However, the United States still believes that the United States has a positive impact on Russia.
Fogo said, "I believe that the Western countries still have an asymmetrical advantage."
It has been previously reported that the Russian Navy will be listed as a submarine of the "Kazan" in 2019.
"Kazan", "New Siberia", "Krasnoyarsk", "Alhangarsk" multi-purpose submarine are "White dragon - M" improved, drainage is 13800 tonnes, the depth of 520 meters, personnel prepared 64 people, underwater speed 31 sections, will carry mines, mines and "caliber" and "baamanau" cruise missiles.

A threat to the United States!
The EU and Iran enter into an agreement to purchase crude oil with Iran
The U.S. government said in November that it would re-open a new round of sanctions on Iran, and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
The U.S. ally did not appear to have heard of it.
According to the New York Times, Iran's Foreign Minister Zarif revealed in an interview that Tehran is approaching a deal on crude oil sales, despite the threat that the U.S. would sanction any country doing business with Iran.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, i.e., to replace the USD transaction in the form of an easy-to-order or local currency quote.
The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing the financial transfer.
At the same time, while the EU is working on the deal, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the agreement is achieved, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
The U.S. media said in an hour-long interview that Zarif's words sound more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "settle" the traditional allies of the United States, effectively breaking the U.S. attempt to cut Iranian income.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit," said Zarif, who believes that in 2015, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran.
Federica Mogerini, the head of the EU's foreign policy, also said, "Any sovereign country or organization can't accept other people to decide who can trade with."
However, she also predicted that before the U.S. government imposed its next sanctions in November, the U.S. leaders could adopt a series of financial measures designed to target banks, merchants and countries with business dealings with Tehran.
In May of this year, the U.S. government, on its part, announced that it would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and that it would not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The U.S. has threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other commodities from operating in the U.S.
The threat caused some of the companies to withdraw from Tehran and the Iranian currency plunged.
Airbus companies and French oil giant Dodar have removed hundreds of billions of dollars from their investment in IA.
British and French officials have said the U.S. government could "take over the wind."
According to a recent Turkish media report, U.S. sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iranian oil exports.
Iran's oil minister has recently announced that there is no country other than South Korea to stop the purchase of Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iran's President Ruhani all agree that the US side's series of acts are intended to "provide" Iran's breach of the agreement.
Zarif also felt disgusted with the U.S. side of a series of verbal attacks, and when asked whether the U.S. would overturn the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressures, Zarif even laughed, "It is a regime change strategy, which is the real purpose of the U.S. side."

Reuters Nagoya Nov. 5 - President of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Kuroda, said Monday that the central bank was aware of the long-term implementation of the ultra-wide monetary policy that could undermine the profitability of the financial institution and could undermine the stability of the banking system in the country.
However, he said that the Bank of Japan needs to maintain its large-scale stimulus programme and closely monitor the advantages and disadvantages of its policies, given the instability of inflation and overseas economies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that the financial institution's strength will be more and more affected by the ongoing monetary easing," he said in his speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions are more willing to take risks, in order to compensate for the impact of the narrowing of profit margins over the years, once there is a serious negative impact, the banking system may be volatile.
"Although these risks are not so big at the moment, the central bank will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
At the meeting held in September, the Bank of Japan Policy Committee discussed the rising cost of long-term loosening policies.
A member of the board said that if the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in terms of policy in the future."
According to the minutes of the meeting, another member said that due to its limitations during the policy duration, the Committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the stimulus policy.
Japan's central bank will assess the financial risks brought by the liberalization policy, while also considering the uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which may affect global demand due to China-US trade friction and the rising protectionism.
"The impact of such issues on the Japanese economy is temporary and limited," he said.
"But how the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy may change," he added.
"It is necessary to carry out a strong monetary easing policy on an ongoing basis while considering positive and negative effects in a balanced manner," he said.
Despite the increase in the drawbacks of the radical stimulus program, such as long-term low-interest erosion of the profit of financial institutions, the downturn forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
The Bank of Japan maintained its monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks brought by the end of the global trade war, Kuroda Dongzi ruled out the possibility of a recent interest rate hike.

According to the SEC, these tweets are actually not based, and the market turbulence caused by them has damaged investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal may enhance Tesla, which has been hit by Musk's recent behavior.
Steven Heim, the head of Asset Management at Boston Common, said the settlement agreement would allow Musk to be more supervised, and would not take him out of Tesla's "destructive" measures.
The asset management company holds Tesla's battery manufacturer Panasonic shares.
In accordance with this agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and one board committee to develop control over Musk's external communication.
"The matter was quickly resolved in accordance with the agreed conditions to meet our market and our investors, including the best interests of Tesla shareholders," Chairman of the SEC Clayton said in a statement.
The allegations on Thursday led to Tesla's market capitalization evacuated approximately $700 million, which was $452 billion on Friday, lower than $475 billion in general vehicles.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC recovered Musk from the company's mainstay requirements.
Many investors say that the punishment will be catastrophic.
"I think that's the best possible outcome for all the stakeholders," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who said Feinseth gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and that the penalties for the SEC were "from a grievous penalty" for Musk.
"He is still the CEO of Tesla."
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledges or denies allegations of the SEC in the settlement agreement, nor immediately responds to a request for comment.
The settlement agreement is still subject to court approval.

Market vitality is derived from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from the entrepreneurial spirit.
In the course of 40 years of reform and opening up, there are 10 million entrepreneurs entrepreneurship and innovation stories, the growth of entrepreneurs group, and constantly promote the Chinese economy.
For some time now, people in the community have expressed some negative, self-doubting statements about the private economy.
The so-called "private economic exit theory", "new public-private joint venture theory" and other wrong sayings caused some entrepreneurs' doubts and concerns.
In recent years, many private enterprises have faced many difficulties and problems in the development of business.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment to some export enterprises have an impact; rapid adjustment of the demand structure has led to the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effect is rampant, or the simple way of working, leading to some original intentions have the opposite role of policy, etc.
A variety of factors are intertwined, the private economy has encountered difficulties, some of the private business is facing difficulties, entrepreneurs have expressed a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correct the understanding of the wrong area, remove the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, so that the enterprise is willing to develop, the government is willing to promote development, the market confidence and development expectations, there is a particularly profound real meaning.
The symposium reiterated the important argument of "three unchangeable": "The position and role of a non-public economy in our economic and social development has not changed!"
From the in-depth promotion of the power of democracy, the establishment of the power list system to the construction of the rule of law environment to protect the legal rights and interests of entrepreneurs, to create a fair competition market environment, to shape the whole society respect the atmosphere of entrepreneurs, in recent years, the Party Central attaches great importance to entrepreneurs, system security efforts like never before.
The symposium also clearly put forward policy initiatives to support the development of private enterprises in six major areas, and launched a series of practical actions dedicated to private enterprises 'light clothing forward'.
All of these are very encouraging for the business community to have more expectations for the community.
The direction is determined, and the key is to implement it.
To continue to build a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises to solve the difficulties in development, help to achieve China's economic transformation and upgrading; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in the market competition, feel safe in the legal business, feel respected in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
The Chinese economy enters the process of high-quality development, requires more entrepreneurs to carry out their ambitions, but also provides more space and stage for entrepreneurs to play their creativity.
We have reason to believe that, with further deepening reform and defeating barriers, the private economy will be facing better development prospects and development opportunities, towards a more broad stage.

The U.S. Department of State later said Secretary of State Pompeo will visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the commitment of the U.S. leaders to meet in Singapore.
Since the beginning of this year, Korea has broken the road of strong ice opening dialogue, the leaders of Korea and the United States held a meeting, the tide of the situation in the peninsula has remained steady, and the principle of dialogue to solve the problem of the peninsula has also been adhered to.
First of all, "The essence of the issue of the Peninsula is the safety issue," this little change, to achieve the Peninsula peace, the key is to properly and balanced to solve the reasonable safety concerns of all parties, rather than a taste of pressure on the other side, and a taste of emphasizing their appeal.
Second, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties are divided on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, because of the long-term lack of political trust between the United States, the thinking of "who first after" is still thick.
The Korean peninsula, which was held at the UN headquarters in New York yesterday, circulated different voices on the issue of sanctions, once again highlighting the two points on the issue of the peninsula "no change."

There is no doubt that the relevant parties should continue to fully, complete and accurate implementation of the Security Council will be involved in the resolution, but the pressure is not the purpose, the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of political solutions are the requirements of the Security Council's resolution, both should not be biased, should not be selected only one.
As the Chinese state commissioner and foreign minister Wang Yi said, due to the positive progress of the Korean and the United States relations, China believes that the Security Council needs to consider the timely start of the reversible terms, thereby encouraging North Korea and the relevant parties to take a greater step in the direction of unnuclearization.
Reflecting on the past, every step of the denuclearization and peace process in the Peninsula requires all parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage.
At present, facing the increasing expectations of the international community to promote political solutions to the Peninsula, relevant parties should show political strength, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, continue to take the pace of the move, and implement the Peninsula nuclearization process and establish a peace mechanism, and jointly create a permanent peace on the Peninsula.

Reuters Tokyo 1 October - The Bank of Japan's Monday short-term survey quarter revealed that the confidence touch of large Japanese manufacturers in September has reached the lowest level in more than a year, due to the rise in raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production, so that companies feel pressure.
The investigation has not yet shown that the ever-increasing global trade friction has hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, the risk of a comprehensive trade war threatens the business prospects and can threaten the company's capital expenditure.
Active capital expenditures are a highlight of the Japanese economy.
The survey has questioned the Bank of Japan's robust economic expansion will help drive inflation to accelerate the view of reaching the 2% target, even if there is a sign that businesses are gradually passing costs to their customers.
"In the case of global trade war, due to slow exports and weak production of factories, manufacturers' confidence tends to stop," said Nanwuqi, chief researcher of the Agricultural Forestry Zhongjin General Research Institute.
"Faith is still on the rise. And I don't think confidence will continue to decline because the profitability of the business is improving and the price increases."
Short-term survey shows that the September large manufacturing environment judgment index decreased from positive 21 to positive 19 three months ago, for the third consecutive quarter deterioration.
The market average is 22.
In September, the large non-manufacturing environment judgment index decreased from 24 in June to 22 in June, for the first time in eight quarters.

Capital expenditures are stable.

According to the central bank's short-term survey, large enterprises plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4 per cent in the financial year ended March 2019.
The previous short-term survey was 13.6%.
Nanwuqi said that all corporate capital expenditure plans for the fiscal year increased by 8.5 percent, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
"There is still room for further growth in capital expenditure due to small businesses raising profits from now on," he said, but this largely depends on the impact of trade war on business confidence.
The short-term survey shows that the ability of enterprises to transfer costs increased, the large-scale enterprise output price index is positive 7, is a decade-long high, which is an encouraging sign that Japan's efforts to combat inflation have made progress.
The index that measures the employment status of large enterprises has reached negative 23, the most striking level since 1992, highlighting the growing employment market.
Japan's economy has rebounded in the second quarter of March from the decline of the first quarter of this year.
But the rise in trade friction in summer and supply chain disruptions to natural disasters have led to a negative outlook for Japan's export-reliant economy.

Today, the opening up of China's landmark Shanghai, the world's first large-scale national-level exhibition on import-themed - China International Import Expo, is expected to be officially opened.

Looking back at the 40 years of reform and opening up, dare to enter the world market of the ocean of China, although encountered turmoil and waves, but always face all the risk challenges with an open attitude, constantly release the internal motivation, and constantly improve the competitiveness.
It can be said that China's achievements with its own real achievements, a powerful explanation of the value and meaning of openness.
Standing on the new historical starting point, holding an import-themed fair, is a major decision made by Xi Jinping comrades as the core party to promote a new round of high-level openness, is China's initiative to open the world's major initiative, is China's support for economic globalization and trade liberalization of the actual action, show that "China will not close the door, only the bigger and more open" strong and clear will.

Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of monopolisticism, adding to the international community's concern about the prospect of free trade, and adding to the uncertainty of a warm-up world economy.
In the context of this era, the celebration of the Yangtze River reflects China's defense of free trade, allowing the world to see the open market, share the future of China's self-confidence and China's responsibility.

As China opens up the door, the flow of goods, the use of goods, the steps towards a better life will be more firm.
From a more macro point of view, the meaning of expo has gone beyond the pattern of economic and trade, but look at the future, to convey an open, inclusive, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win concept, to form a common understanding of today's challenges.

More than 90 per cent of Brazilian female voters say they don't consider women's needs.
According to the South American newspaper, the Brazilian Institute of National Geographic (IBGE) has recently released data that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that the presidential candidate considers the needs of women.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 1.07 million, and if women from Brazil gather together to form a country, the population of this country will be ranked 13th in the world, more than twice as large as the national population of Spain.

"Politics should be democratically democratically civic rights, identity, public goods and form a society by multiple social groups, but the politics of Brazil belongs to a monopolistic group, most of which are not represented."

Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
Studies have shown that 76% of women believe they can do what they do in democratic elections, and 72% of women are politically interested.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less bias.

Although the global financial market continues to turbulence, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the foreign exchange fund fell by 97% year-on-year, but better than last quarter's performance.
According to the latest information from the HKMA, the foreign exchange fund received an investment income of HK$16 billion in July 2018, substantially lower than HK$618 billion in the same period last year, but better than HK$100 million revised in the second quarter of this year.
In the Legislative Council, the HKMA's chairman, Mr Chen Delin, said that at the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock index and the US stock market index are back, until the end of September and the beginning of October, the US stock market index continued to meet the top, the market sentiment began to reverse, because investors are increasingly aware that the trade war is also detrimental to the United States itself.
"The change in market sentiment is a good thing, if the trade war only has a unilateral impact, it is not helpful to solve the problem."
But he added, "If the US-China trade war fails to resolve, the volatility of the financial markets will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund in Hong Kong's stock investment losses decreased by 8% to HK$4.7 billion, while the foreign exchange investment income increased by 172% to HK$128 billion; the foreign exchange losses of HK$162 million, the bond income of HK$9.7 billion, decreased by 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the rise in the US dollar's main currencies during the quarter and the US yield of 3% in the middle of September.
The foreign exchange fund is mainly used to support Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong has been implementing the Hong Kong Dollar-linked exchange rate system since 1983.
For the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the economic and asset market uncertainty has increased, and the downside risk has increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is stable, but also good defense, with sufficient seismic ability.
"Hong Kong's international investment position is sufficient, with net worth of $1.4 trillion equivalent to 4 times the GDP, higher than Singapore's 2.5 times and Japan's 0.6 times, to deal with the downturn cycle or reverse enough."
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar rate has risen by more than 400 basis points on September 21, according to Chen Delin, the market generally believes that the Hong Kong dollar rate is mainly related to the rise of the Hong Kong dollar rate, followed by the HKD dollar hovering at the level of 7.80-7.84, to the recent Hong Kong dollar rate continues to decline, with the expansion of the US dollar spread, may attract the market to sell Hong Kong dollars, the increase in the interest rate of the US dollar, so that the Hong Kong dollar once again triggers the weak side of the guarantee opportunity more than a few years ago.
But he believes that with the start of the interest rate hike cycle in Hong Kong, Hong Kong dollar rate normalization will change in the future, the Hong Kong dollar rate will be lower than the US dollar rate.
"The Hong Kong dollar rate will be more consistent with the U.S. dollar rate movement, and everyone must be more careful to manage risk, be prepared to deal with market fluctuations."
Due to the abundant funds in Hong Kong dollar, the Hong Kong dollar spread further fell 0.9% to 2.08179% in three months, spreads from 46 basis points to 51 basis points, and spreads from 120 basis points to 127 basis points in one month.
From May to mid-September, the HKD spot exchange rate was close to US$7.85 for 1 hour.
During the period, due to the bonus activities and large-scale IPO activities after the completion of part of the investment funds out of Hong Kong dollars and other factors, resulting in the weak side of the exchange guarantee after the first in April was triggered, in May and August again and again.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) purchases and sells HKD at a rate of 7.85 in order to maintain the stability of the HKD exchange rate.
The HKMA purchased approximately HK$521 million in May and August under the Weak Exchange Guarantee Scheme.

Reuters Hong Kong - Hong Kong's property prices fell for two consecutive months after the meeting, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Chief Executive, Mr C Chan Delin, said on Monday that it would take time to see if the market has entered the downtrend, and if it is confirmed, it is possible to consider the tightening policy of the ongoing relaxation cycle measures at the appropriate time.
Chen Delin also said that if the price of the first hit will be in the peak period of the building, but the price of the building is expected to fall in 1997 when the Asian financial crisis, and the opportunity of the public to cut the selling property is very low.
Mr Chan led a number of senior executives of the HKMA to attend the briefing session of the Legislative Council, saying that if it is confirmed that the building has entered the fall cycle, it can be appropriate to relax at that time.
"But now it's only a few weeks of data, and relaxation is still too early, but it still takes more time to see if the building has entered the downtrend cycle."
Since the 10th of 2009, the HKMA has launched eight rounds of reverse cycle measures to significantly tighten the mortgages of various types of properties, including reducing the factor of mortgages, and applying for mortgages must pass rigorous stress tests to enhance the risk management and resilience of banks.
As Hong Kong enters the interest rate hike cycle, the private housing price index in Hong Kong rebounded in two consecutive months in September, with a month-on-month decline of 1.44 per cent.
The growth in the first three quarters of this year was 10.2%.
According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the household financial condition of Hong Kong's resilience to financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, Hong Kong households have a no-mort residential ratio of 66%, which is higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11; the newly approved mortgage mean ratio and the new approved mortgage contribution and income ratio are 47% and 34% respectively, which has improved significantly compared to 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11.
But Chen Delin said that the high seismic ability does not mean that the residents of the property will not be damaged by the economic downturn, because the property valuation will fall, and the people who buy the building at the peak will be the first to hit it.
Although the HKMA draws close to the bank's borrowings from mortgage borrowers, homebuyers can also obtain a high percentage of mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or by providing a mortgage loan from the developer.
Chen said that the mortgage loan amount of the borrower can be as high as 85-90%, if the price of the property falls by one percent, there will be a negative asset (i.e. the market value of the property falls below the total amount of the outstanding mortgage loan).
However, Mr Yuen Kwok Hang, Deputy Chairman of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities are estimated to provide a high-incentive total mortgage by the developers, accounting for only 2-2.5 percent of the total bank mortgage, with a lower ratio.
In 2003, the number of negative assets in Hong Kong was more than 1 million, accounting for 22% of the building population.
In the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

A systemic lupus lining is a chronic problem of a tired and full body of multiple organs, which was thought to be a "disease" in the past.
Due to unknown pathological mechanisms, diagnosis and problems, the lack of effective treatment and treatment should not be cured.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the College of Life Sciences of Tsinghua University, and the director of the Beijing University People's Hospital for Humidity and Immunity Center, chestnut occupied the United Nations team found that human immunoglobulin presence increases the susceptibility of systemic redspots, and this mutation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams have confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic red spot disease.
According to one of the authors of the article, the People's Hospital of the North University of the People's Republic of China Mr. Sun Xiaolin, the team gathered nearly 2000 large-scale systematic red spots patients and carried out research, and found that in patients with immunoglobulin mutations, a large number of their own antibodies, lutein, arthritis, rhinoplasty, vascular inflammation and other inflammatory incidence and serious increase.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracking, animal testing, and sequencing, the Liu Wanli team discovers the immune signal channel of this immunomolecular mutation activation, and promotes B-cell secretion of multiple autoimmune pathogens.
The reporters learned that the two teams are strong and united to give full play to their respective advantages, achieving a close integration of basic research and clinical applications.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immunization and immuno-activated research, chestnut conglomerate team is engaged in long-term systematic clinical research.

It is not a short task, but a matter of law.
A lawyer in court with his axe?
The news was really exciting, and it also broke out in the legal circle.
The Chinese law of Quanzhou City, Fujian, then fined the lawyer for 500 yuan, and suggested in writing that the Quanzhou Lawyers Association investigate and deal with it.
According to the Beijing report, the Quanzhou Municipal Law Association issued a formal notice that the behavior of the two lawyers does not involve violations and will not be punished according to law.
From the multi-faceted report, the treatment of Quanzhou City Liaison is not short or engaged in fighting, but has been recognized by Quanzhou Central Hospital.
Together, it may cause tensions within the legal community, and eventually it can be resolved properly.
The reverse of the matter stems from a more complete truth: the axes carried by a lawyer are the same as the weapon of the defendant, the same model, but not the edge, only in the presentation of the supporting evidence, and there is no fear of the move or "threatening the security of the court" of the subjective intent.
To determine whether the lawyer's behavior is illegal, there are four very important details need to be concerned: First, the local court had previously opened the court twice, only to show the axe photo, from the defense point of view, to show the axe raw material is its necessity; second, the axe is in the court one hour before the opening to buy, not the attorney does not want to seek the consent of the judge, but objectively unable to contact the judge; Third, the whole axe is not overly or improper use; Fourth, the first time the attorney is open and apologize to the court.
All of these cases can be seen that the lawyer "with an axe out of court" has nothing to do with the matter, but only for defense.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou Municipal Law Society did not follow the water push boat, but the top pressure made a decision not to punish.
This decision can also be tested for facts and regulations.
As for bringing the axes of a controlled tool to the court without the permission of the court, it is really easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For safety and caution, the former penalties and judicial recommendations of the Quanzhou Central Hospital are not too thick.
In order to protect the lawyer's dignity and prevent the individual court from lending difficult attorneys, the Supreme Law issued the People's Court Judicial Police Safety Checking Rules in 2014, which established the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct personal safety inspections.
Since the release of the rule, a large number of lawyers, as a rule, rarely occur due to security breaches that jeopardize the security of the court.
In a very special case like Quanzhou, as long as we communicate with each other in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, it is difficult to misunderstand.
As a self-regulatory organization in the legal profession, the Lawyers Association has a dual mission of discriminating against illegals and safeguarding legal rights.
In the past, individual law associations had suffered from illness due to their preference over rehab, loss of protection.
The decision of the Quanzhou Law Society, whether it is from the process or the outcome, is commendable, and an example is set for the correct implementation of more legal agreements.

"Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico have negotiated a new trade agreement - the USMCA, which will provide high-standard trade agreements for our workers, farmers, and companies, which will facilitate more free markets, fairer transactions, and more sustainable economic growth.
The North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994 by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Mr. Trump announced his intention to reconsider the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The negotiations between the three countries began in 2017.
In the early morning of the local time, the pre-emptive election of Okuhida Prefectural Office was held to announce the results, and the Yucheng Danny, who was planning to move the U.S. military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was voted on September 30, and the final result showed that Yucheng received a total of 39,6632 million votes, creating the best of the county governors' election history, more than 80,000 votes than its main competitor, Sahi Jinchun.
A total of 4 candidates took part in the election, with a 63.24 per cent vote, down 0.89 per cent from the 2014 Ohio County Magistrate Election.
Yucheng told the media that the results of the election indicate that the county people do not want to pay for their previous efforts. He will inherit the legacy of the Secretary of State Wen, and continue to work with the Japanese government and the U.S. government on the opposition to the U.S. military base moving plans and the closure of the Universal Base.
Putian U.S. military base is located in Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture, and has been plagued by illness. The Japanese government has previously agreed to move it to a nostalgic area of famous city, but the people of Okinawa strongly opposed it, hoping that the base will be completely swept out of Okinawa.
And for the county people strongly opposed the move plan and the removal of the request for land reclamation permission on the border of the ancient coast, Yucheng said, he initially did not stand with the central government and split the position, hope that the two sides can fully exchange views, showing the intention of resolving by negotiation.
Japan's Prime Minister Abe also told the media on the morning that he was seriously accepting the result, and would make efforts to revitalize and reduce the burden on the base.

He also expressed his desire to have a meeting with the city.
Yucheng will officially be in Ochikawa County on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, with China's growing demand for oilseeds, U.S. farmers in North Dakota grow more and more soybeans in their territory.
This transition reached its peak this year, and he planted 1,600 kilos of soybeans in 5,000 acres, reaching an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to replant the main crops of former U.S. agricultural areas: corn and wheat in 2019.
For the first time in 35 years, U.S. farmers have grown more soybeans than corn.
The reason for this is that U.S. farmers are planning to sell soybeans in the context of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war on China.
China usually buys about 60% of U.S. soybean exports, but because of the trade war, the price of U.S. soybeans has fallen to a decade low in recent months.
Thomas plans to produce more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing the dependence on crops that are dependent on Chinese demand.
Thomas said that the soybean price "has brought us a painful hit."
He said that there is no need to buy soybeans in China, and the spot price near its farm is $7.10 per bulge ear, and the price necessary to cover the cost is $8.50 per bulge ear.
U.S. farmers have recorded a high record for soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is also expected to record a high record.
At that moment, they were confronted with a trade war.
China imposed tariffs on imports of U.S. soybeans in July on Trump's tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will publish its first estimate of the area of cultivation in the coming year, which will include considerations for the impact of tariffs.
It is expected that the number of soybean species will be reduced.
According to a report by Reuters, Informa Economics predicted that in 2019, the area of corn planting will increase by 4% to 9,27 million kilos (3.7 million hectares), and the area of soybean planting will be reduced by 7% to 8,3 million kilos.
It is also expected that U.S. wheat crops will increase by 4%.
The area of soybean grown before the implementation of the repetitive tariff has risen to 8,96 million pounds this year, up about 15 million pounds from 10 years ago.
Corn cultivation area has increased by less than 5 million kilos since 2008, to 89.1 million kilos, this year's wheat cultivation area is 47.8 million kilos, nearly the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Planting Association, has its own total planting area of 3,500 cubits. This year, he is nearly half used to grow soybeans, but plans to cut some of them in the future.
He said it was possible to increase the corn planting area by up to 20% on his farm in northern Illinois; the state is the largest soybean planting state in the United States.
Soybeans produce less than corn, but the need for fertilizer is also less, which makes the overall soybean production cost less.
If the farmer moves to the end-value maize, it may increase the cost, but will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc. fertilizer sellers.
Pat Bowe, Chief Executive Officer of Andersons, said that he expects the transition of corn to be beneficial to the use of fertilizers.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the transformation of corn by farmers.

New China International Time Assessment: defend multilateralism, China's knowledge and cooperation.
In the present time, international rules and multilateral order are undermined.
To a certain extent, unilateralism and multilateralism have entered a critical period.
As a responsible country, China follows the ideology and actions of the avenue, and works together with the international community to protect multilateralism and promote the continuous development of multilateralism.
In the face of new challenges, China has a strong voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As Secretary of State and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in the general speech of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the multilateralism of the new era should adhere to the goal of cooperation and win-win, based on rules and order, with fairness and justice as the basis for the purpose of effective action as the guide.
At the same time, China calls on the United Nations as the core, north-south cooperation as the main channel, and south-south cooperation as a complementary global development and cooperation pattern, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thoughts and voices reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.

With Zhu Yuling returning to the field, Dingning 4: horizontal sweeping opponent to win the crown.
Last month, Dingning won the Bulgarian Open, and ended up with a 14-month run of champions, which came to Chengdu, although she stated before the race that her goal was not set, and in the semi-finals at the end of the morning, Ding said that she had completed the task.
In the end, Yu-Ling Chu, a friend of Ding-Ning, won the personal third World Cup champion, and she was satisfied with her performance: "A champion is important for every athlete.
I didn't think about it before the race, just said a game to get rid of it, to finish playing very well or very satisfied."
When Chu Yuling, who fought in the main scene, received a silver medal, did not complete the goal of defending, talked about whether the host's enthusiastic audience would create intangible pressure on himself, she said: "I feel that the whole game I can handle the pressure, today's Dingling's play is very good, resulting in that I have not found any rhythm."
Activate rural consumption, rely on the normalization mechanism to clean the market, guide the healthy consumption demand, improve the sense of farmers' consumption.
According to the data, the potential for consumption of rural residents continues to be released, in the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, and the growth increased by 1.3 percentage points out of the town.
In a poor village in a western county, there is only a convenience store in the village, and some goods appear to have been familiar with, "Jinlong fish" is marked as "Jinlong oil", "Wangzi" became "Wang milk", "mountain cottage" goods a lot.
Over the years, similar phenomenon has been revealed, some of the rural counterfeit goods are brand-named, similar name, similar packaging, and false.
A consumer survey report issued by a city in the west shows that rural merchants have a serious problem with counterfeit goods, and 66% of users have bought counterfeit goods in supermarkets under the rural line, of which food accounted for more than half.
There are many reasons why the "Li ghost" still stands in the way of regulating the rural market.
Unlike the urban market, farmers' rights are relatively weak, coupled with a lot of remote rural locations, is in the blind zone under the supervision of the strong enough, so that the inferior goods have breeding soil.
A commodity multi-header, some sector management prices, some management production, some management market, cross-functional, annual leave, centralized management of a wind, fake past the wind, but slowly out, just finished the old and fake, new and fake.
Lack of long-term effective regulatory mechanism, rural market is difficult to clean, low cost of law violations, large profits, resulting in some illegal business has caused the "uphill and downhill rural" distorted brains, some rural areas become the "disposable market."
From warm to small, large farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
Recently, the Party Central and State Council issued the 'on improving the mechanism to promote the mechanism of consumption of residents and further stimulate a number of views on the potential of consumption of residents', which proposed to promote the upgrading of rural residents' consumption ladders, with the aim of allowing large farmers to 'can use', 'willing to consume', ' dare to consume', so that rural consumption really flourish.
On the one hand to deepen the reform, eliminate the market supervision and administration of multiple, multi-head management shortcomings, according to local arrangements, improve food safety, product quality supervision network, and constantly tighten the space of rural leave, sales leave.
On the other hand, to increase law enforcement efforts, the regulation of "capillary blood vessels", it is not allowed to fake and bad breeding in rural areas.
Strict pit peasants are farmers, regardless of how much hidden the system is, should not be the reason for the breeding of counterfeit goods, the relevant departments should be clear responsibilities, the grassroots supervision force sinks, which aspects of the problem, should be investigated, let the fraud, sellers no hiding.
Strict market access, manufacturers to carry out a strict qualification review, the market circulation, let the product go straight, go clear, from the source, the root of the way, let the legal dealers operate with peace of mind, so that farmers can buy peace of mind.
Enabling rural consumption to guide the needs of healthy consumption.
With the growth of consumption, many farmers are not only hungry, good food, but also the pursuit of culture, health and other high-quality life, can not the rural market with the "low-quality" "low-cost" pictures and so on.
This needs to promote e-commerce to the vast rural extension, the urban and rural two-way parallel sales channels, promote the offline industry development platform and online e-commerce platform combined, support the development of new models of consumer consumption and new business to the rural market, promote the condition of the rural urban commercial logistics and leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing and other organic combination; improve the modern circulation network system in rural areas, optimize the integration of inventory facilities, effectively reduce the cost of rural circulation.
To create a clean and safe market environment for rural areas, so that farmers do not care about consumption, rural consumption can be more and more, in order to enhance the sense of farmers' consumption, happiness.
