28-year-old chef is found dead in a San Francisco store
A 28-year-old chef recently moved to San Francisco this week was found dead in the stall of a local mall.
But the victim's brother says that no one wants to harm him, and says "it's all good at the end."
The body found in Westfield shopping centre on Wednesday morning confirmed to be a 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death case was found to have been committed and investigated.
Louis Galicia, the victim's brother, told Radio America's San Francisco radio station KGO that Frank, who was formerly a waterline chef in Boston, found an ideal job as a waterline chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesperson at the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "extremely shocked by Frank's death."
The spokesperson said, "We are a small team in close proximity to a family, and we will deeply regret it."
We extend our deepest condolences and condolences to our family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank originally lived in a guest house, but recently "it's all over."
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank has found an apartment while interacting with a girl."
Louis Galicia said that he did not want anyone to harm his brother.
Frank has a generous heart and a generous heart.
"Frank often cooks dinner for his family," says Louis Galicia.
He was never willing to talk to his family.
He is a person of opinion.
"Everything in the world can go wrong," says Louis Galicia, "but Frank is known as a man who shines brightly every day."

Primary Medical Practitioners: Call for New Labour Action
The primary medical representative association approves its new employment action against the new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association's primary medical committee will require all its members to support more labor operations since early September.
The primary medical committee said the ministers did not address concerns about the contract.
Junior physicians and medical students voted against a contract deal with the British Medical Association in July.
58% of the voting participants opposed the contract.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Board of Primary Physicians, said in a letter to members on Thursday night that the government "honestly remained silent" on issues that led to contract boycotts.
"In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Primary Medical Council has voted in full on the proposed new contract and called for a formal consultation on all concerns," she said.
In view of the government's silence, the Executive Committee of the Primary Medical Council has formally today called on the British Medical Council to hold a special meeting to approve a long-term plan for upgrading the workforce operations from the beginning of September.
The conflict has led to the participation of primary doctors in six rehabs this year, including the first comprehensive rehab in the history of the British National Medical Service.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the primary physician leader of the British Medical Association, resigned after the contract provisions recommended by the British Medical Association were voted on.
In a meeting before the 54,000 primary doctors and medical students voted, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was correct and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced in the medical staff in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Greg into the Union"?
A crisis is an end to a crisis.
On Tuesday, the two sides held a handshake and announced a formal end to the eight-month spear war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met the Turkish President in a beautiful hall of the Palace of St. Petersburg, I had a strong feeling: the reconciliation was the most desirable to see in Ankara.
Of course, the two of them were actually hand-in-hand.
However, even in accordance with Mr. Putin's in-house standards, Putin is only a small smile, and almost no intention of showing enthusiasm.
According to the report, Rejepp Taip Eldoan refers five times to "friends" Putin.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that his relationship with Russia would return to the level of pre-crisis and even higher levels.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdogan's performance did not seem to happen.
However, I think his enthusiasm suggests some opposite things.
However, Mr. Putin's attitude continued to show that he did not forget anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in the opening white was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet at the Syrian border.
The response at the time was very intense.
Mr. Putin was stunned by the incident, accusing Ankara of recognising Moscow behind it.
Attacks from so-called friends are more difficult to accept.
It is difficult for both parties to re-establish and not even re-establish true trust.
Since the beginning of November, the Russian people have also changed.
For several months, the government-controlled media has launched a shocking full-fledged attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, Turkey seems to be responsible for everything.
Among them, the most serious of these are the accusations from senior officials: Mr. Erdoan's family benefited from illegal oil trading in the Syrian region controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied that statement.
However, the message sent by St. Petersburg shows that it is time to look forward.
After the meeting, Putin received an apology from the Turkish President Erdogan.
Russia has declared victory.
The benefits of the war in Ankara are obvious.
First of all, Erdogan was more at risk after last month's coup failure, so he needed support from all his friends.
The ongoing terrorist attacks have been a huge hit to him.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have hit Turkey a lot, especially the possibility of sending millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has dropped significantly by nearly 90%.
As the flight resumes, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved.
At the end of the month, the Mediterranean tourism is expected to continue.
The National TV even predicted that once the imports of Turkish agricultural products reopened, the prices of fruits and vegetables would fall.
A report by the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said, "The tourists are gone, the tomatoes are back."
For Moscow, this visit also has an additional political value.
Ankara is angry at the weak reactions of the Western world to its takeover intent.
In addition, Ankara has long been dissatisfied with the slow progress of the European Union's negotiations and Putin's interpolation. Putin is keen to exploit political coldness and weaken relations between Turkey and the Western world.
As a result of a coup in favor of the election, the Russian leaders will receive additional points from Ankara.
It should be noted that this is a great feedback for Moscow, which has been deeply troubling by political changes.
Thus, the meeting in this golden, brilliant seaside palace made Russia and Turkey both ally by the Western world to refuse and abuse, and one analyst described it as a "grid not into the alliance."
However, despite the open reconciliation, there are still significant differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played a role in Syria as well as a criminal, while Russia and Turkey have supported the opposite party.
It can be seen that, after nearly three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that the topic has not been discussed yet.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the differences between the two sides, and Putin stressed.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to coexist in Syria.
Under the possibility of several months of open enemies and large catastrophes brought by the fall of the Russian fighter jets by the NATO member Turkey, the leaders of the two countries will re-open the dialogue again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland.
According to the Chief Executive Officer of the Royal Bank of Scotland, banks will simplify into a logistics department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McKown told the British Broadcasting Corporation Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand had been committed to its global ambition.
However, eight years ago, when he was faced with a fallout, he had to accept the relief since he had given up his pursuit.
At that time, the brand strategist used ‘RBS’ to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent millions of dollars in sponsoring international sports events such as the Rugby Six Nations and the Wembley Tennis Championship winner Andy Murray.
But right now, the right approach is to make more national brands shine.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but it will not respond to the original.
In England and Wales, all withdrawals outside of headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Alster Bank brand has been used by customers in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland Autonomous Regions.
There are also some more prominent smaller private banking brands, such as Venture Bros., Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McKenzie was interviewed during an Inverness County customer and employee visit.
"The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand, and it is also one of the employee-employed brands, as we have become a bank with a large number of brands at present," he said.
As the bank itself becomes an international brand, RBS is also a global brand.
At present, I would like to point out that we no longer focus on the world, we have turned our eyes to the local.
Each brand represents a different industry, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has stated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations; and has been working to raise the image of different brands sponsoring at the sporting events.
"It's time to become a multi-brand bank, because privately we've been exploring how to become a better bank for our customers," said CEO.
If we were to be a big bank with many brands three years ago, we would be mocked.
We are currently focusing on customer needs and I am confident that you have noticed these changes.
I think we can re-launch these brands, and now it's time for the right time.
Dato's success gained 3,000 jobs in Nemesis with Prediction.
The two victories of Numakit helped Daittori get a career of 3,000, after which he splashed the perfumes to celebrate.
On Friday, professional horse rider Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory in Newmarket.
He curbed the prediction of John Goden, who was trained by his master, to win two victories that night, and to gain a career of 3,000 victories.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional horse rider to achieve this milestone in the field of Pingyao.
The top five are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"It's very special," said the three-time champion rider, who won at Ghayyar earlier.
I'm excited because my family is on the field.
I'm very happy with the results I made in Nebuchadnezzar because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a large-scale race, nor a Royal Ascot, which is just a Friday night with 20,000 visitors.
I am delighted and humbled.
After winning the game, Daitaro came to Prediction, causing the whole crowd to cheer.
In the obstacle course, there were two riders who achieved this achievement, including champion rider Richard Johnson and now retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, where Sir McCoy achieved more than 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Poge was the 9th German championship winner with 4,493 wins in his career.
As one of the best riders in the modern age, it is no surprise that he achieved this milestone achievement, not many people who had achieved it before him.
He was always well-behaved, but he really let him out of the weight room, but he was tactically rational.
He is an amazing Mathematician and has attracted a lot of fans for his passion and charm over the years.
A few weeks ago, I told Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend rider, he would have won 6,000 games!
To be honest, it's one of the UK's best motorists in 30 years.
He's a good man, but he's an incredible rider.
Dattori celebrates this milestone with his iconic jump
For more than two decades, Daittori has been a typical representative of the UK flats.
His professional career is like a roller coaster.
He has won several tournaments, including the famous "Seven Wins" he won at the Royal Escarma in 1996, but he has also suffered from a hangover and has also been banned from the tournament due to the use of contraindications.
Three years ago, when he returned to the stadium after six months of ban, he was very hard. However, he showed an amazing character advantage and finally returned to the peak, giving those who had a questionable attitude a head start.
He may not be able to do it for a long time - he said before Daittori, hoping to be able to compete at least 50 years ago.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismisses office of Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly lifted the office of the President of Sergei Ivanov.
Over the years, Mr. Ivanov has been a member of the core group trusted by Mr. Putin.
Ivanov, 63, is now appointed as a Special Representative for Environmental and Transport issues.
A statement from the Kremlin stated that Mr. Putin had "announced the dismissal of Mr. Ivanov's head of the Russian President's Office," but there was no reason.
Anton Vaino, who began his role as Mr. Ivanov in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Wainnow is 44 years old and is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow National Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later manages the draft President and the government staff, the Kremlin Palace website (in Russian), as it were.
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the government is to support the drafting of laws and control directives by the heads of state.
Mr. Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself asked for his resignation and recommended Mr. Vajno to take over himself.
Isn't that kind of smile credible?
Moscow is not aware of this.
For a long time, Sergey Ivanov has been one of Putin's most intimate assistants, just like Putin, and has worked at the Soviet Security Agency (Kegeb).
As the director of the office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin on the National Television, both of them claimed that the office director himself requested resignation.
Despite a smile in front of the mirror, almost no one was convinced - especially before the parliamentary election.
Is this the result of a defeat in some sort of war?
Not yet known.
However, the official statement, a man who had been treated as a presidential candidate, suddenly chose to take advantage of Russia's environmental policy, has caused a lot of doubts.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr. Ivanov's dialogue with Mr. Putin, saying, "Yes, at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position in a dialogue, and it could even be a difficult position, a four-year term."
"I have served as the Director of the Office of the President for four years and eight months."
Mr. Ivanov held this position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as the Deputy Prime Minister and the Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council, as well as Mr. Putin, and a former member of the National Security Council.
At the end of the twentieth century, when Mr. Putin became Director of the Federal Security Bureau (FSB), Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
After Mr. Putin went to office, he also designated Mr. Ivanov as one of the five most trusted.
Mr. Ivanov may be appointed as President of Russia at the end of Mr. Putin's second term because three re-elections are in violation of the Constitution.
But this position ultimately belongs to Putin's other close assistant Dmitry Medvedev.
After three and a half years of re-appointment, Mr. Putin served as the Prime Minister of Russia.
Mysterious Fish Surprises Banff - A Garden
A resident of Banff found that a fish was surprised by its own garden and then asked for help.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 species of fish may have been drawn from sea scrolls.
Mr. Bain lives about 500 metres from the sea, and he posted a video of this strange scene on Periscope, hoping someone could explain to him why the two-inch long fish would appear.
Queensferry Bridge is now in Fife
The project is projected to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the North Bridge to the Queensferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now open to Fife.
Located in the vicinity of the three bridges of each bridge, the four "bridge wind turbines" halong is now approaching completion, and the project is the first halong bridge.
The bridge, which started in Fife, is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 helical extrusions.
The $13.5 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the scene today and became one of the first people to board the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic moment in the construction of the Kunsfeld Bridge.
We have all witnessed the construction work on such a large project, and the use of more than 30,000 metric tonnes of concrete and steel for the construction of the bridge.
Although the size and weight of the bridge is huge, the completion of the joint between the bridge and the bridge requires careful operation and requires very precise assembly.
In general, nearly 79% of the bridge surface is now installed, and the last section of the concrete bridge surface is today in Rosyth, which means that all the bridge surfaces are ready.
"No matter which bridge project, the first Dragon is a major milestone," said Michael Martin, General Manager of the Kunsferry Bridge Construction Company.
In terms of this remarkable project, the company exhibits cutting-edge civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the road panel and connecting it to the expanded Northbridge Road Panel, you will need to complete the remaining gaps on either the north side or near the ground side.
To complete the operation, it is necessary to move the north-facing bridge to 700 mm south.
This is a very large piece of work, but also a very detailed one.
It is said that it is huge because the bridge is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes, it needs to be pulled out a slope of about 3%.
It is precision, because the engineering team needs to make sure that the deviation is very small, and only a few millimeters per side.
I am glad that everything has progressed very well.
Simon Bayers Wins Women's Gymnastics Championship
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by this.
It's full of energy when jumping.
Balanced wood ups and downs.
The free body movement is amazing.
The overall performance is excellent.
It has finally become an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old U.S. gymnast won the championship on Thursday, fully demonstrating her world-leading talent in gymnastics.
She has a total score of 62.198, the final five team Aly Raisman and the bronze medal winner Aly Mustafina.
Simon-Biers from the United States performed a balance wooden show at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, at the Women's All-Inclusive Finals.
Bayes helped the U.S. to achieve a four-fold win in the Olympic Women's Gymnastics individual, she personally won five medals at this Olympic Games, further certifying that she is the generation, perhaps the best gymnastics player ever.
When she saw her total score, Bells couldn't help but shed tears. She finally ended her long journey.
As a result, Bayes is on the list of "thousands of athletes" just like Michael Phelps, who take sports projects in their respective areas to new heights:
For the past three years, Bayers has won 15 World Championship medals, including ten gold medals. She is determined to train hard every day to achieve higher accuracy. Mary Lou Retton, 1984 Olympic champion, said: " Bayers is the best gymnast I have ever seen."
There is also a final game in Brazil, but the game is said to be a competition between Bayes and other gymnasts, rather than the amount of pressure she has with her own huge expectations.
If Bills is not full of gold to return to her home in Spring, Texas, you will surely be very disappointed.
Simon Bayers (left) and Lesmans, from the United States, were awarded gold and silver medals at the 2016 Summer Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bayers won the first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise tribute to the upcoming national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Even though Bayes asserted that he did not plan for the future in the process of occupying the throne of the Champions, the fact is not completely so.
A quote from the Balls Freestyle - including her iconic turn-around series, featuring Latin music, which is what she hears most often in her only one block away from the Rio Olympics.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents during the infant period and was discovered by Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip at a gym.
Since the summer of 2013, Bayes has not lost in the All-Powerful Game, and if she wants to win, she will definitely win.
A little bit of leadership after the two spins of Mustafina is just an illusion.
The world champion Bayes is waiting for the two projects that balance wood and free gymnastics.
Her balance wood score is 15.433 and free gymnastics score is 15.933.
While waiting for the final score, Lesmann slapped Beles. When Beles realized that he had achieved his dream, he left his tears.
Lesman's performance seemed like a revenge of four years ago, when she was third in the same row, but lost to Mustafina in the final game.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain of the American play called "grandma" is far ahead.
She kissed the crowd at the end of the free gymnastics and declared her return, but this return seemed to be questionable at times.
Bayes was only 19 years old. Since early this week, his news has spread on Twitter as a virus. For Bayes, his life has been given a new meaning.
Mahaj Brown, 6-year-old, "massive bombs", is released in Philadelphia shootings
Police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shot in the city this week.
Grandparents of their children confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child was shot by Mahaj Brown.
Brown's abdominal slits, legs, arms and abdomen were shot several times, they said, but the child was sober when he was sent to the doctor.
'He was guilty of a lot of crimes, and a small body was hit with a burlap,' his grandmother, Delores Melendez, said to the TV.
I just can't believe it.
The boy was in a critical condition in the hospital and had received multiple surgeries.
His family told the TV show that the child is expected to recover.
He started his first year at a local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people killed in the Germantown area.
Of the other three, two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in a critical situation; the other two were in a stable condition.
According to the TV station, the child was found on the front seat of the car in a critical situation with the 29-year-old.
The two other victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether there was a gunman in the injured person.
The investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like a number of gunmen were shooting.
A number of offensive weapons were found on the site, which can be speculated that they were using different offensive weapons.
This is, without a doubt, a continuing struggle.
There are bullets on the sidewalks on the streets.
"So, you can see that there were a number of armed men on the scene at the time," Philadelphia Police Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi said to the TV.
Many homes and vehicles were damaged.
Police have not yet been arrested, and it is reported that the police are watching surveillance videos.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old child (girl) was shot in the air when playing at the entrance of the West Oak Lane community.
She is currently recovering and the police are still chasing suspects.
Why we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurel
This year's Women's Olympics is more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I have been to every Summer Olympics, but the United States has never dominated this position.
Second, the team has three excellent gymnastics athletes, Simone Biles, Gabriel Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspiring a lot of girls of color.
The formation of the team makes everyone proud because it contains Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian.
The team finally looks like the United States team.
It also reinforces the top position of black and Latino women in this movement.
For the past four years, the leading female gymnastics athletes have been African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel were ranked 1st and 2nd.
This is too hard.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabrielle Douglas "unprecedented" became the Olympic champion, which makes the United States no longer welcome.
Today, the world is witnessing three world champions, Simon Bayers, Douglas, and Laurel El Nandes.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team to achieve four consecutive crowns on the Women's All-In-One Project.
Her teammate, Ali Lesman, won a silver medal.
We climbed the peak of this movement, but it was not the case in the American gymnastics classroom.
Simon, Gabriele, and Laurel enter the Olympics as well as Ali and Madison.
They are the "Final Five", because the next Olympics will be composed of four sportsmen, which is the final year of teaching in Marta Karolii.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnastics is primarily trained at a private gymnasium where their parents are required to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, races, and hotel costs (including costs associated with coaches and gymnastics and their families), and the list of costs is on the rise.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the industry.
All training for gymnastics is completed in these clubs, which is a long-term, expensive expense for families of gymnastics.
Aimee Boorman and Maggie Haney, a coach from Ernandez, have been teaching them since the two gymnastics began to practice.
We need to bring more affordable and affordable gymnastics training to countless young girls who are heavily influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurel.
Twenty years ago, I started my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provide free, inexpensive gymnastics to over 15,000 city youth (mainly black and Hispanic Americans) in Black residential areas, and develop national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to those who deserve the opportunity to learn and will benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.
Physical exercise helps to develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, and also helps to develop the spirit, self-discipline and determination of hard work.
These can bring life-long benefits to a person's health, education and work success.
Inspired by this team, tens of thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
Thank you to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their wonderful "girl power" in the process of winning the Olympic gold medal, and also thank them for inspiring so many young girls of different backgrounds to open up to a healthy, powerful and successful path.
After returning to Jeremy Hunt's proposal, the primary doctor plans to initiate further re-work.
At first, the ministers wanted to end the dispute caused by the change by accepting a contract from the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58% of the 37,000 primary doctors involved in the vote opposed the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying that the British National Medical Service (NHS) is currently in the "vacuum zone" and that there is a slight delay in harming the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first refers to the modification of primary doctors working at night and weekends to improve the care of non-working hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Primary Physicians, said in a statement last night: "The primary physician is still very concerned about the proposed contract, especially if it increases the current workforce crisis and fails to treat all physicians fairly."
There are only eight weeks left to sign a new contract from the first batch of doctors, and we need to make progress, not much time.
BMA strives to resolve disputes through negotiations, but everyone is unwilling to participate, and sometimes the government is silent about it.
In spite of this, we were promised by Jeremy Hunt last month, and he said his door would always be open.
"Jeremiah Hunter now needs to take action to cancel the enforcement and resolve the fear of primary doctors."
If he doesn't, the primary doctor clearly states that he is ready to take further labor action.
The last surgery occurred in late April, resulting in nearly 13,000 regular surgeries and 100,000 scheduled delays, as nurses and clinicians covered the line for doctors.
At first, the ministers wanted to end the conflict caused by the change by accepting the BMA modified contract.
BMA hopes to seek better weekend wages for 54,000 primary doctors involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, called for primary doctors to no longer perform any rehearsal.
Mr Mortimer said, "The labor movement is very effective, but on the contrary, it will put pressure on the team and services that have been paid attention to, causing patients, caregivers and their families to worry, worry and confusion."
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the primary medical committees and working with the Department of Health and other departments to respond to their concerns about the role of guardians and disclosures.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics, such as deployment, flexibility of training, additional training, training costs for those who re-employ after a career break, shared awareness of coursework, gender pay gaps in the field of study leave and medical care, which illustrates employers, the Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health's commitment to a contract with BMA in November, February and May.
£2 a day can reduce the risk of heart disease
The relevant officials recommend the promotion of a drug of £2 a day to more patients and to extend the duration of the drug, and then thousands of heart patients will benefit from the drug.
Anticoagulant ticagrelor can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
This drug lasts for 12 months after heart disease, reducing the risk of recurrence of stroke or heart disease.
The National Institute of Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE), a subsidiary of the National Medical Services System (NHS), advises patients to continue taking medication for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
However, NICE, the NHS regulator, recommends that patients continue to take medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease every year, one in four continue to suffer from heart disease or stroke.
Heart disease and stroke are caused by the formation of plaque by the accumulation of fat in the arteries wall.
If the plaque is broken, it will cause blood clots, which can block the blood flow into the heart, leading to heart disease.
If the blood clots move, they will enter the blood flow, obstruct the blood flow into the brain, leading to stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of heart attack.
Tikagor is manufactured by AstraZeneca, a British company that sells products under the name Brilique, which can reduce the risk of developing thrombosis by reducing the formation of thrombosis.
Today's NICE guidance draft recommends patients to take 90 mg of Tikagar for 12 months, and 60 mg Tikagar and twice aspirin twice a day for the following three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said, "While there is an effective secondary preventative treatment, as many as a quarter of patients with a history of heart disease can get sick again or have a stroke, which can often lead to serious consequences."
The fear of recurrence will have a negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence suggests that taking aspirin with cataracts can effectively reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in patients who have experienced heart disease.
We are pleased to announce that Tikagor's temporary recommendations will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who benefit.
Due to the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Tikagor after three years, especially the risk of bleeding, the guidance draft is not recommended to continue to use it after this period.
Computer culture makes the "election fraud" popular in the Muslim region
Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was prompted to publish a government report on corruption last year.
The "political correctness" culture makes the widespread corruption of the Muslim community viewable, a deadly government report today reveals it.
Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet minister, accused the police, the electoral regulators and the Municipal Affairs Office of the House of Representatives of the United States of America of being too sensitive to racial discrimination and religious issues.
The former community affairs minister and the current counter-argument said that taking religious stances to provoke the bad, the police should be allowed to set up a warning line outside the polling place to protect the treacherous voters.
He recommends that voters bring along their identity documents to prove their identity.
Currently, voters only need to state their name and address.
The report even recommends applying ink on the voter's finger to prevent second-person voting.
Sir Eric said that the protection of the reporters should be increased.
He urged the media to increase their understanding of the conference documents and the decisions of the unofficial committee or working group.
"It's not just about preventing the election fraud, it's about protecting local governments from the widespread corruption culture and financial fraud that is closely linked to it," he said.
The report was released after the Tower Hamlets election in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that a series of corruption and violations in the mayor of Rachman should be dismissed.
The court found that Rachman was “very ridiculous to use” the religious sentiment of the Muslim community and closed his mouth on allegations of his racial discrimination and Islamic fear.
According to Rachman, "the religious obligation to vote for him at the time of the election is faithful to the Muslims."
Up to 300 voters are suspected to be impersonating others.
Sir Eric said there was evidence that there were frauds in the elections across the country.
He warned of the fraud by mail, and said the senior members of the Muslim community were under pressure to force them to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (in the photograph) gave several recommendations on the cleanup mechanism, including bringing along identification documents to verify his identity
"The evidence shows that senior members, in particular senior members in the Pakistan and Bangladesh context communities, put pressure on vulnerable groups of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people to vote as they wish," he said in the report.
"Because they are too sensitive to racial division and religious 'political correctness', they are concerned that the state agency will ignore such behavior."
Sir Eric proposed 50 rules to clean up the electoral mechanisms, including the ban on political activists to handle mail voting files to stop "vote harvesting."
The report also requires strict checks on registration information to prevent voters from being used in immigration and welfare scams. Theresa May also considers the report.
These recommendations include requiring voters to present their ID before voting.
After the vote, the voters put their hands on the ink to wipe away the ink, preventing someone from voting twice.
To systematically verify the nationality of the voters to ensure their eligibility to vote.
An automatic vote-by-mail request will be valid for three years.
Prohibit political activists and activists from processing completed vote-by-mail ballots and mail-by-mail ballot envelopes.
Authorises the police to set up a line of warning around the polling station.
Amendments to the provisions of the Act make it easier for the person concerned to be sued in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act.
It is illegal to take photos at the polling place.
Only English is allowed at polling places (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff strictly implement the provisions of the "selection room for voters alone".
The Metropolitan Police said they did not raise any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident, which was "surprisingly not".
"Rachman and his electors have been subject to numerous corruption and law violations and have been disqualified by the election court," he said.
In many respects, according to the criminal evidence standards, he is undoubtedly guilty.
He also criticises the City Hall election registration department with the fictitious "checkbox check".
"Last year's court passed a judgment against Tower Hamlets," said Sir Eric.
Our country has a glorious tradition of the "Mother of the Parliament", but some institutions privately and secretly plagiarized the election frauds and the subsequent allegations of troubling, which also threatens a good reputation.

CBC organisers apologize for the Chinese swimmer "slow like a pig"
Byron MacDonald, 14-year-old, Byron MacDonald's comment on the women's 4x200-metre freestyle relay infuriates viewers watching Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) live broadcast
A Canadian broadcaster, CBC, said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer will be "faster than odour spread" in the race, and finally, "slower like a pig", and CBC was forced to apologize for this.
Explained that Byron McDonald made some of his own views at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, when he thought he had turned off for his own mic.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl has made a fool of herself," said Byron, who commented on the CBC Explainer team.
Because it was too excited, it started to spread faster than the odour, but later it was as slow as a pig.
She was also very much lost.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, Ai Hin, was the second best swimmer, taking 1 min. 57 seconds 79 - after Canada's Taylor Ruck (1.61 seconds), resulting in a cut in the Canadian team's gap from China.
The entire audience in Canada was shocked by the tone and speech of the interpreter, and then they quickly responded on the network.
Emmett Macfarlane said: "The CBC spokesperson said China's 14-year-old swimmer 'slow like a pig'???'
The idiot didn't realize it was live.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl has made a fool of herself," said Eigen, who participated in the Women's 4x200-metre Freestyle Relay Final.
Byron McDonald's criticism of Byron McDonald quickly splashed on Twitter, and many people asked him to quit.
When Twitter users heard that Byron McDonald's reaction was delayed, they did not catch it.
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow #Byron McDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words have been heard by all of us as a group of racists.
Shortly after, CBC broadcaster Scott Russel apologized for Byron's remarks and said, "We apologize for the comments made by live swimmers."
"We're sorry to hear that inappropriate wording."
CBC has apologized to Twitter users who responded to this statement more than 90 times.
A spokesman for Scott Russel also apologized.
The CBC then posted their apology copy to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting Byron's interpretation of it.
The channel also apologized and issued a statement.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and will continue to be posted.
Last night, we quickly took action to apologize to the audience who watched our live broadcast and to follow our audience on social media.
It should be noted that Byron's explanation is for the performance of the swimmer, but not for her personal.
In other words, the wording is not correct, and Byron apologizes deeply for this.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized in the live broadcast, saying his words had no half-point physical attack meaning, and tried to use this to get rid of his speech.
"I would like to take some time to apologize for my words I posted at the end of the women's relay last night," he said on CBC's broadcast.
"I just comment on the performance of the swimmer, not on the individual."
"Of course, I don't mean disrespectful, I'm sorry."
The customer expressed anger at a woman who tried to wear trousers in the middle of the store.
A woman takes off her pants at a Primark's central store, where customers don't know where to look.
Even worse, she looked at how she looked after herself, and then took off her trousers and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and finally tried four panties inside the store at Bouverie Place, located in Folkestone.
The woman tried to wear trousers at this Primark store in Bouverie Place, in Folkestone, and then put them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson (the mother of two children), who was also in the shop, said that after trying to wear underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again, and then went out of the shop, nothing to buy."
She said, "Everyone can't believe what they see."
She stood in the middle of the store and took an inner pant from the shelf, took off her tights and inner pants, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a hiding place to try to wear - she just stood there and was really embarrassed."
"When she took her pants off again, everyone was surprised to stay. Obviously, she wasn't happy because she put them back on the shelf."
Then, she tried three more things like this, and finally found that she didn't like it, and then dressed again and went out of the shop.
"She doesn't seem to care about anyone looking at her--or she doesn't think anyone would eventually buy the inner trousers she's trying to wear."
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said, "When I think of someone who would buy other people's underwear that wasn't washed, I feel nasty."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "After she left, the store staff obviously had to deal with these inner trousers."
"I hate buying a new pair of trousers at home, but I found another woman trying to wear it and not being washed."
A spokesperson for Primark said, "Primark already knows what will happen on Tuesday, August 9th at our Folkestone store."

How to Protect Yourself with a Gun Attack
This video on Dailymail.com may give you a sense of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York to learn how close to the target shooters are.
Whether it's in front of you or behind you, this video will teach you how to succeed.
Mizrachi said that if a gunman draws near you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and "clear the line."
Next, hold the gun with your forearm and shoulder, then use your elbow to hit the attacker's face.
He then broke his abdomen on the knee, turning his hand when the attacker slapped his son due to pain, and smote his face with a gun tube and a backarm to keep his weapons against him.
If a gunman is approaching from the front, it also uses similar techniques - keep your body out of the line, grab the gun and twist the gun so that the gunman can't open the fire.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker's chest, twist the gun from his hand, and then turn the gun against him.
Sounds complicated?
Take a look at the video and see how Mizrachi did it.
But remember, if you're not a magazine master, the safest way to get rid of robbery is to give money.
A gangster family destroyed a low-rent apartment in Soltash, Cornwall County before the evacuation
A gang-raped family who had been evicted from their neighbours was destroyed before leaving, resulting in a loss of £50000.
After a long series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and his husband Shaun Trebilcock were fired from a flat in Soltash, Cornwall County.
After being forced to leave the residence, the Housing Society officials were surprised to find that there was a serious damage.
There is a hole on the wall, the floor is broken, and the trash is full of them, and the wall is painted on the insect.
After being deported, the family has been relocated and said they are currently living in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, Director of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said she was worried that the house could no longer be saved.
"This is a nightmare for the people who live here," she said. "I don't think anyone can live like this."
There are many things that need to be weighed now, as this house is likely to become a bad element in Cornwall County.
The family is infamous and their names are also infamous.
The couple has three sons, who will live here from time to time. Police say the terrorist acts of the family include the use of baseball sticks to fight on the street, the fear of nearby residents, drug use, drug abuse, shouting, quarreling, and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received an anti-social behaviour decision.
In a house that may have been demolished, many of the rooms are long-standing.
In the room where drugs were traded, the floor was lifted.
The neighbours said they often saw them fighting in the street, and that they were often alarmed.
After the extension of the 11-week extension left them voluntarily, the Cornwall County Housing Association forced her to leave the residence with her husband this week.
At last, the neighbours in the surrounding area were so happy that they said their life was just a human prison.
A neighbor said, "They don't care about anyone."
We've lived next to them for 20 years and it's been so bad.
We have seen many police officers.
"We're not going to sleep this morning."
We got up early because it was too quiet here - we weren't used to it!
Then they went on their way, and it was a great experience for them.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of the Community, Cornwall County Housing Society, said the family did not work well with the local government.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years and the police regularly visit the house.
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the side of the weed in the low-rent apartment
He added: "Unfortunately, the guest is not responsible for her behavior with her family, and expulsion is the final consideration of the County of Cornwall's Housing Association."
This is a very difficult case to deal with, because their actions are very extreme, and their actions must also make neighbors feel afraid.
I would like to thank my team for their work, as well as the Devon and Cornwall police and the brave community members who have provided us with information.
I hope this move will bring some comfort to the neighbors and convey such a message: we are absolutely intolerant of anti-social behaviour.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said his three sons lived in the house at the same time, but said they were only 20 years old.
One of the bedrooms also had a dirty bed on the floor after they were smuggled.
The housing association workers will soon clean up the debris piled around the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found 70 more cannabis, found balance, drug use and £1,700 cash.
After conviction, Skeldon is fined for holding Type B drugs and drug trafficking intents.
She said that money was used to buy gravestones for Lee Skeldon's son who died in a car crash in 2013.
Tanya and her husband are now living in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the multi-room apartment are filled with paint.
The police said they were evacuated from tenants who violated the Tenant Rules.
Angela Crow of Devonshire and Cornwallshire Police said the expulsion issued a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the Tenant Rules.
"This warning is aimed at those who think that their actions will not be blamed, and those who are undermined by such actions," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police do not tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, and they will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary Clinton will nominate Garland to enter the Supreme Court
President Harry Reid, the Democratic Party leader of the Senate, said he was confident that if the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, was elected as president, she would nominate a judge from the Garland to enter the Supreme Court.

Treats: Nude Calendar "Loved by Men and Women"
Treats magazine will work with photographer David Bellemere to create a 2017 calendar inspired by the '70s Pirelli.

The French Court of Appeals for the Dismantling of Shop in the Jungle Refugee Camp
A French court issued a request for the removal of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the "barren" refugee camp. The refugee camp currently houses thousands of refugees.
At the hearing of the court this week, the French government said that the French government should have the right to dismantle 72 temporary establishments in the refugee camp. The public sells goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, provides hairdressing services, also sells tea for 50 cents (40 pence) in the temporary establishment of restaurants or sells basic meals for a few euros.
The Office of the Governor of Galley believes that these places should be demolished because they are non-taxable parallel economies, and there are also fires and health risks.
Humanitarian groups are very important to the courts for these shops and restaurants because the free food provided by nationally-supported associations and other groups cannot meet the needs of the growing refugee camps.
These temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to evict the 72 temporary stores, but said the Governor's concern was "fully understandable."
Judge Jean François Molla said that the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is much more than simply providing food to those who "live in extremely dangerous conditions."
He said these places are a peaceful confluence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the areas threatened by the demolition of the refugee camp is the "Jungle Book Kids" cafe, which offers 200 daily food, English and French classes and shelters for hundreds of unaccompanied minors.
More than 170000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
In a letter to Guardian, closing the cafe "will be a catastrophe for these children (many children are only eight years old).
Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants expect the number of refugees in the jungle refugee camps to exceed 9000 on Friday, the highest level since the surge in the number of refugees in the summer.

Two institutions, do not "join" each other, to prevent the village cadres from participating in the collective assets business corruption phenomenon.
The Deputy Director of the Agricultural Commission of Jiangsu Province said that the next step will continue to promote the reform of the community share-stock cooperation system, encourage farmers to jointly develop, and establish a democratic power operation mechanism at the village level.
Congratulation: further push forward the reform, engage in community share cooperation, quantify the assets to the community members, fixed to the farmers, to form a clear title.
Through the Internet +, the implementation of his right to know, the decision-making of the participation and the supervision of democratic management, the implementation of three rights to the farmers, in fact, make it a standard share cooperation operating mechanism.
At present, the new collective economy of the rural areas of the south mainly forms the asset leasing, enterprise share-type, agricultural development, joint development of the four development models.

Zhang Binbin, Xiamen girl: "handsome beautiful" began shooting career after "reversing"
Zhang Donghong, a few days ago, in the east garden of Xiamen Xiangan District, just replaced the 29-inch old TV in the home, which became a 65-inch TV.
The daughter of the ordinary farmer was Zhang Binbin, who won the Rio Olympics Women's 50m three-shot silver medal for China on the 11th night.
11 day and night, just before the new TV, Zhang Donghong couple and dozens of relatives and friends, together to witness their daughter's efforts to chase, from almost preliminary was eliminated to a big reverse of the magic process.
In the game of that day, Zhang Bin once ranked down, seems to be far from the final.
But parents and family and friends did not give up, and constantly brushed the text live, see that with the other runners finished the race, Zhang Bin was raised along the way, and finally decided to take the final seat, in his home, exploded from a greeting.
In the final, Zhang Bin was again ranked after a time, the last few shots of the more stable, only the back of the crown 0.2 ring to win the silver medal.
This year, 27-year-old Zhang Binbin, during his 16-year career, there have been a number of differences from the easy-to-use silver medal.
His mother, Xiaolong, told reporters that when they were in doubt, Zhang Bin looked for a few "small talkers" in the village.
These "little guest" are the children of the same village that were recommended to participate in the training this year, including Ms. Zhang Bin.
Shortly after entering the team, Zhang Bin once again went back to Xiangan school because of family difficulties and other reasons.
But after his inaugural coach Zhang Yajie repeated his work, Zhang Bin returned to the team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Bin was unable to return home because of the late arrival of the national team, once because they did not see hope.
This time, not only the coach Zhang Yajie, the leadership and coach of the Xiamen Archery Sports Center and Fujian Province team came home, and finally advised Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Like yesterday's match, the girl's persistence to achieve a reverse on the road of shooting.
"The way every coach chooses the team is different, when I saw the hand of Bun was very beautiful, and I suddenly got in the way."
Zhang Donghong also remembers that in the training test, although the daughter is not the best performance, but the ring is very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Bin to attract the coach.
In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie's most impressive, is the input of the farmer's girl.
He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Bin entered the shooting squad, the team carried out long-term shooting training, requiring the team to not move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and nice child, from the little ones like to paint and make their own handmade toys,
"In the beginning, I would make clothes and fill ups at home, and Bun would pick up some corners to do my own dolls."
She said her daughter would often make her own handicraft toys, plus her good at painting, from the five officers of the doll to the clothes, can always do it like life.
As an athlete, Zhang Bin and his family have a lot to get away from, and only on holidays can they come home and contact by phone more often.
Parents say that whether it's meeting or making a phone call, Zhang Bin rarely talks about his hard work, more is to talk to his parents more openly.
When the daughter is not seen at all, the parents carefully collect the daughter's paintings and the honor of the year at home.
Zhang Xiaolong presented her daughter's cartoons as a reporter, "If there is no shooter, she should still continue painting."
On the second floor of the Zhang Bin family room, a cabinet filled with the medals, medals and certificates she received.
Zhang Donghong put the medal and the medal together, and the certificate was put into the folder to save, "These are the honors of the couple's ten years of heart change, we are all cherished."

According to the Hong Kong Eastern Daily on August 12, there are three major problems in the current domestic diamond sales, including the promotion of false diamond net price, false diamond weight, no guarantee after-sales service, etc.
And Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers. The name of the local craftsmen's diamond cutting technology is full of the world, and the diamond sold is strictly determined, and is welcomed by the mainland ladies.
"A small cloth bag, holding a small piece of hand, a slap in the hand, with a value of nearly millions," a woman who participated in the purchase of diamonds, Liu's surname, to the mainland media to describe her experience in Antwerp this June.
She said she kept the diamond in her underwear and took it to the toilets and showers for several days, and was very nervous on the way to sleep.
She said the purchase price of diamonds in Antwerp is about $55,000 per carat, and the retail price of diamonds of the same quality in Xiamen is about $11,000.
She sold all the diamond purchased at a price of 20% yesterday, and made a fortune of 200,000 yuan.
According to the mainland customs regulations, the diamond is not a passenger in the itinerary of the goods or necessities, so it belongs to the product model, the entry and exit must be declared, or listed as smuggling, in the case of serious imprisonment.
According to external media, on 10th local time, British Prime Minister Donning Street announced that the British Prime Minister Teresa May will go to Switzerland for a summer vacation, but did not reveal specific holiday locations.

China's Mars Project is Coming
China's Mars exploration mission is to achieve a circle, landing, tour, this form has never been abroad.
China's Mars detection launch goal is to want to step around, land, and visit, this task has a considerable difficulty.
Because Mars exploration takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are rigorously developing a project plan to launch China's first Mars detector in 2020.
Although our aircraft has entered deep space, it is still essential to complete the Mars exploration mission, and the exploration of Mars means that China has entered deep space exploration from a real sense.
"Every two years or three years, there is only one chance that Mars will be the closest to Earth, and at this point, Mars detectors will be the most energy-saving for carrying rockets."
"In consideration of the quality of the Mars detector, the mission will be completed by our Long March 5 carrier rocket."
China's Mars exploration mission is to achieve a circle, landing, patrol, this form in the foreign world has never been, overseas has to be a circle and landing, but the landing failed.
There are many technical fields involved in the exploration of Mars, and in particular, although Mars is a space probe, it has a bright feature compared to the general space probe.
In other words, the Mars detector must have the ability to determine the route to travel and identify the dangers of obstacles.
China Aerospace Science and Technology Group five institutes of research, said that the reason for human exploration of Mars is that it has important scientific, technological and other aspects of the significance of exploration of Mars, and even relates to the future of mankind.
At present, Mars has become the planet with the highest level of human research other than the Earth, and human use of space detectors to explore the history of Mars almost penetrated the entire human history of space.
Therefore, humanity hopes to one day establish a base of residence on Mars, and eventually immigrate to Mars to become the second home of mankind.
A number of signs also show that Mars is likely to be like the current earth, but after billions of years of evolution, it becomes the atmosphere thinner, lower temperatures, and water depletion.
As a result, exploring or carrying a man on Mars for research, can make a prediction to prevent the Earth from becoming the second impossible to survive on Mars.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 lunar probes were conducted worldwide and 43 Mars probes were conducted.
However, since the 90s of the twentieth century, there have been 18 explorations on Mars, and the lunar exploration has only been carried out 14 times.
There are currently 5 orbiters and 2 orbiters on Mars at work, but only 1 month orbiters and 1 month orbiters at work.
The world's astronauts have developed a exploration plan for the Mars system, which is why today's Mars exploration is hoter than the moon.
On November 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe "Mangarian", becoming the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
"Mangarian" is used to study the characteristics of the surface, atmospheric and mineral on Mars, to explore whether there are methane and life signs on Mars.
The most difficult part of this mission is that the detector enters the Mars atmosphere with only one chance of aerodynamic shapes and landings.
According to the general manager of the headquarters of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, Mr. Sun Zezhou, the general designer of the general office of China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, introduced the mission of Mars exploration facing many technical challenges.
Mars atmospheric pressure is low, only 1% of the Earth's surface atmospheric pressure, with high uncertainty.
Scientists have yet to have a thorough understanding of the factors such as its changes and the nature of the storm.
In the summer, Mars often forms a dust storm similar to the earth's sandstorm, which causes the solar energy received by Mars vehicles to drastically decline, and must design a "sleep" mode for Mars vehicles, so that they can patiently wait for the dust to pass.
At the same time, the atmosphere of Mars also has its effect on the sun, which brings difficulty to the energy supply of Mars.
This requires that the solar wing of the probe be larger in size and needs to be continuously adjusted to align with the direction of the sun.
The surface of Mars is only 38% of the Earth's gravity, but much more than the surface of the Moon's gravity, so the detector needs more power.
"The most central and difficult part of this Mars mission is the process of the detector entering the atmospheric atmosphere after the atmospheric atmosphere and the aerodynamic shape of the landing beams, and there is only one chance to ensure success."
The whole process cannot be controlled by the ground in real-time due to the distance between the Earth and Mars, so it must be done independently by the detector.
Since there are not so many promoters to offset such a high speed, when landing on Mars, the deceleration depends on the role of the Mars atmospheric, but the Mars atmospheric is difficult to simulate on the ground.
In general, the method of exploration of Mars is similar to the method of exploration of the moon, which is also the "turn, fall, tour, return", and ultimately to achieve the goal of landing man on Mars.
Since Mars is far from the Earth and far from the Moon, exploring Mars requires a series of more complex technical challenges.
According to the Taiwan media report, Taiwan's "Executive Yuan" Lin fully announced yesterday morning that the "political party and its affiliated organizations improperly acquired property processing regulations" came into effect today.
"A more than 100 years of history of the National Party, with social commitments and responsibilities, will not be closed."
Mr. Lin stressed that if a party, ancillary organization, or trustees violate the provisions of the prohibited sanctions prescribed by the regulations, the Committee will investigate and "dispensate according to the law".
Mr. Lin also announced that the vice-president of the party product committee will be appointed by Taiwan's "Deputy Director of the ICAC" Hung Bacon.
He said that the Board of Directors of the Irresponsible Party Products Committee, which serves as the basis for the Board to review the relevant major cases in the past, will be used as the basis for the Board to review the relevant Irresponsible Party Products.
Zhang Kaijun believes that today, as long as there is a party, no one will give you a social donation, if the party unity is full of collect, the National Party can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "Today there is no chance to go."
Zhang Kaijun also stressed that even after the unfair party goods regulations on the road, the national party goods are not fully charged and confiscate, the rest will still be in accordance with the commitment to donate, so that the party goods to zero, the party should everything from scratch.
Former title: "The Corridor Doctor" Lan Yuefeng v. President Wang Zhi An Infringement Appeals

12th look: Track start China team is very busy women's four bicycles looking forward to break through
The bike is expected to achieve the Olympic gold "zero breakthrough", and the female football team will challenge the German team of the two world champions, looking forward to the explosion of cold.
Wangzhen's two-season status is outstanding, last year Beijing Athletic World Championship won the silver medal, and in May this year the group race to upgrade the personal project champion.
According to external media reports, 27-year-old Korean archery female candidate Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in the female archery individual race, and after the succession of the team won the gold medal in the Olympics again, to become a crown.
She was considered to be a late winner of the London Olympics, but now proudly stands on the highest podium of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Huizhen won a gold medal at the Women's Archery Individual Finals held at the Rio Samba Sports Complex in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in defeating Lisa Unru of Germany with a total score of 6-2.
She first shot an arrow at primary school grade 4 until she first won a gold medal at the World Cup in 2014 at the age of 27, and was a famous late player.
Zhang Huizhen recalls, "There was no level before attending high school, so as to not be able to participate in the national competition.
Zhang Huizhen won only the fourth place in the London Olympics four years ago. Unfortunately, he lost his ticket, and he could only win two gold medals with his colleagues and friends.
Zhang Huizhen spoke at the end of the Women's Archery Individual Awards ceremony, "until the end is as good as possible to shoot an arrow, which may bring good results, satisfactory heart."
28-year-old Korean Archery "Ladies" and London Olympics Archery Individual Gold Medal Winner won a bronze medal.
Chihuahua won in the semi-finals to Zhang Huizhen and competed with Mexico's winner, Alejandro Valencia, for a bronze medal.
In order to make sure that the bronze medal, the metal stamping bearing between it can be understood.
First, the coach group has accumulated a wealth of experience in continuous research, followed by scientific training methods, which all require long-term accumulation.
Archery helps the team to focus and maintain a normal heart by means of military training, night trekking through graveyards, etc.
Even though it hasn't been confirmed yet, many sources have said that Apple's Fall 2016 launch will be held in September, and iPhone 7 will be here.
Even though Apple has not responded, the new iPhone features and configurations have been broadcast continuously, and even the iPhone 7 "real-life model" picture has been connected online.
The new generation of iPhone can be called "Mundane", hot, fast, and out of stock... If you want to buy authentic first time, be sure to choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This exacerbated people's disappointment with the new phone, "It has grown, but it can't project hologram images at all! This generation of iPhone is poor."
iPhone 7, like other iPhones, comes with a lot of secrets before birth.
In addition, a number of sources claim that the new generation iPhone will cancel the 3.5mm headphone interface, and then use the Bluetooth connection and charging interface, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to support this is that as early as 2014 Apple allowed headset manufacturers to produce headset products connected through charging interfaces.
These messages are true or false, and the answer will not be revealed until Apple's Fall 2016 release.
But that doesn't stop the industry from looking good at iPhone7 - many believe that iPhone7 will be the last major upgrade of the iPhone series.
Although the market share of iPhones has declined from data released by IDC recently.
Among them, Goldman Sachs maintains Apple's stock "buy" rating, while BMO's analyst believes that iPhone 7 will receive a historic sales performance.
According to Hock Tan, Apple's future revenue increase is likely to be more than 20%, thanks to the launch of iPhone 7.
7% of respondents said they had plans to buy an iPhone7, compared to only 4% who planned to buy an iPhone6 two years ago.
It is understood that currently 20% of users with an iPhone6 or 6Plus plan to purchase iPhone7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Second, there is an expert analysis, most fruit powders like to replace their iPhone phones separately.
According to statistics, around 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in 2 years, or nearly 1.2 million iPhone users have used it for 2 years.
According to the media, Taiwan suffered several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production, "the destruction of TSMC's production facilities is beyond imagination and may have an impact on the initial iPhone7 supply."
Supply and demand conflicts will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time at a low price to get a genuine iPhone7.
According to the informed sources, recently, Suning high-level met with Apple's company in order to prepare sufficient supplies.
Operators have discussed with Suning, and it is foreseeable that with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, will inevitably bring lower prices and more attentive service to users.
"At the lowest price, consumers may be able to buy iPhone 7 for just $7 a day."
Adequate supply and a variety of offers, so that the purchase of iPhone 7 no longer "pressure mountain", and Suning's logistics, will turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning easy buy, your iPhone 7 is coming."
The host hopes that through the cultural relics exhibition, the local people will understand more about the historical Chinese culture, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
Barcelona's "Civil Heritage Exhibition" is part of the European Tour, which will last until the beginning of October.

According to the external media, due to the change of the pool water from the blue to green, the Rio Olympic "green pool" event has recently been prepared for external concern.
However, on the morning of the 10th, the water from the pool that is adjacent to the swimming pool has become green.
The Australian Water Polo athlete said his eyes were tinged with tingling and he wanted to shed tears.
Previously, the official personnel of the Rio Olympics confirmed the change of the pool water to green, and indicated that the change of the pool water color is due to the cause of alkaline deterioration, will not affect the physical health of the athletes.
However, Australian athletes said their eyes felt tingling after winning a game with the Japanese team in the water pool.
After the first change in the water in the pool of the diving pool, the tournament organizers overtime in the 9th night to deal with the problem of the diving pool, but on the morning of the 10th found that the color of the pool also changed rapidly.
The environmental conditions of the pool in Australia and Japan have gradually deteriorated, but the official emphasis is that they will restore the water quality of both pools to their original colors on November 11.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the Rio Olympics, said: "Yesterday in the afternoon, the alkalinity in the swimming pool first weakened."
“We understand a range of causes that may cause a change in the water quality of the pool and the alkalinity of the water quality.”
The Water Sports Centre has conducted a series of tests on the water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers use the swimming pool to determine the water quality conditions to meet the standards."
"These days we've been working on normal procedures, but we may ignore the more athletes may have an impact on the quality of the water."
"But changes in the color of the water definitely affect the health of the body, especially the athletes."
“This independent team confirms our assessment and also affirms the measures we take to restore the pool to its normal color and normal chemical state.”
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but it was affected by the speed of the recovery due to the rain."

On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the state economy in July 2016.
In July, the growth of some indicators of national economy slowed down, but it still operates in a reasonable interval, according to the National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson, the Secretary General of National Economy Integrated Statistics.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics shows that data such as the growth of fixed assets investment in July, total imports, etc. have fallen back.
On the national economy in July, I want to borrow the Prime Minister once said that the phrase "form is volatile, the situation is still good," which can better summarise the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "form volatility" refers to the growth of some of the economic indicators in July has really dropped.
Because the domestic and foreign economy is still in a deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and varied, the recovery of the world economy is not as expected, so export pressure is still relatively large.
From the domestic situation, the whole economy is still in the key stage of adjustment, adjust the pain in the release, the economy faces a small downward pressure, so some indicators have some fluctuations.
In July, there was also a special situation, flood disaster is more serious, high temperature hot weather for some regions of the production and operation of some.
According to the recent issued by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than six million people in the country suffered a disaster, direct economic losses of more than 20 billion yuan.
From the perspective of industry, investment, and transportation, the different levels of these areas are affected.
The volume of goods per week in July increased by 3.6 percentage points from last month, floods have a certain impact on the traffic in these areas.
From these factors, some of the indicators in July also appear to be normal, but also as expected.
He said that "the situation is still good" refers to the economic growth has declined, but the overall economic operation is stable, and the situation is stable and positive has not changed.
In July, the CPI rose 1.8%, and the CPI rose 0.2% year-on-year; the CPI rose 2.1% in July, so the overall price situation was stable.
According to the statistics of high-temperature weather in various districts of Chongqing City Weather Bureau portal, in addition to the sun, the other parts of the city can receive different degrees of high-temperature allowance.
At present, there are at least 28 provinces in the country clear the grant distribution standards, but the standards issued by the provinces and cities are not the same, and the rebirth is in the way to obtain the high-temperature allowance.
35°C or less than 37°C, according to the daily distribution of no less than 10 yuan standard; more than 37 °C, according to the daily distribution of no less than 15 yuan standard.
A maximum of 20 yuan per day per month for staff above 40°C (except workers who have already enjoyed the high temperature job allowance according to law).
In accordance with this standard, the highest number of high temperature weather days in the last month can receive 330 yuan, the least number of days of the city is 80 yuan, and the highest temperature in Yinyang because it does not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many units will resist high temperature allowance with cool drinks, and the Municipal Security Bureau said that this behavior is not in line with the current method.
If the labor force ceases to work due to high temperature and shortens the working hours, the labor force shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers.
According to the Municipal Bureau of People's Affairs, employees encounter high temperature operation but do not receive high temperature allowance, can through the enterprise's employment dispute mediation agency to seek the legal rights and interests, or call 12333 to lodge a complaint.
If the employing unit refuses to issue high-temperature allowances, the worker can file a complaint with the competent department of human resources and social security at the county level or above where the worker is located.
At the same time, because high-temperature allowance is part of the salary, not the welfare, to include the total salary, deduction of tax.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum salary range, it must be distributed in the form of cash, and can not be replaced by other physical substances such as drinks.

Grecia is a tiny female squirrels that radiates the atmosphere of tropical rainforests.
In Central America, Costa Rica, the birds of the sea and its stories have long been familiar.
At the press conference on August 10, Grecia, who was restored after surgery, finally appeared, to show people its new 3D printing plastic birds.
It was only a year and a half ago that the slapped, bruised birds were finally reborn.
The day not only announced that it has recovered 100% of its health, it is also the day when it moved into a luxury birdhouse and met with human friends who care about it.
Grecia, the first home in the country, is a little slippery, but often becomes lively, slapped in the basin, and ate grapes with new.
In order to remind people of the damage they have suffered, the technician did not give it a new color, but retained the original white of the 3D printing material.
The bird outside is a thin layer of horned, which is hollow, with only a few fine bone support poles intersect.
Although there is such a thing as internal reinforcement, the rattle of the birds of the mouth is fragile and broken when damaged.
Animal Rescue Center, Birdologists and a 3D printing company in the United States have created several "tests" for Grecia, and finally created the "perfect" that is most suitable for it.
Today, Grecia is skilled in drinking water, eating food, and even picking up fine grains.
"The design of the final product took about 2 months, and it only takes 4 or 5 hours to print out."
'3D printing is not a technology of the future, it is actually in the process of going into your life,' said Thomas Langer, president of the US SG3D printing company, in an interview with Xinhua International Journalist.
In January 2015, a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province, central Costa Rica, was found as a bloody giant bird of Grecia.
At that time, its upper body was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was unable to eat at all, and life was at risk.
Following a media report from Grecia, there was a booming protest against animal abuse both inside and outside Costa Rica.
People demand a more stringent animal protection law, and an increase in the punishment of abusers.
People do their best to help Grecia restore life before the injury as much as possible.
Even the inventor of 3D printing technology, Chuck Hell, is also involved in the design of Grecia.
"The situation in Grecia is very special, and its upper portion is less than 1 cm, so it brings a lot of difficulties for the installation of a new one."
"We first scanned Grecia, and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis that was a little longer than the rest of it, fixed with adhesives on it."
'This can reduce further invasive injuries to Grecia,' said Lange to the New China International Journalist.
Before installing the plaster, staff will clean up the greasy plaster every day to prevent infection.
Far thousands of miles away, the story of the giant bird Grecia is inspired by the famous documentary director Paula Heredia and explores John Hoffman, a news channel producer.
They recorded the point of the installation process in Grecia, recorded a documentary "The Birds of the Giants", which has been broadcast on the Animal Planet channel this month.
The documentary "The Country of the Birds of the Mouth" shows people how a small bird can make a country change, and how citizens can participate in the fight against animal cruelty.
Core Tip: Japanese oil companies are particularly vigilant about the rise of small independent oil refineries in China, which are known as "teahouses."
Japan's largest oil company, JX Energy, said on August 12, "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn.
Japanese oil companies are particularly vigilant about the rise of small independent oil refineries in China, which are known as "teahouses."
China's oil product quality is becoming increasingly close to Japan due to the Chinese government's enhanced environmental protection regulations.
Before obtaining the import permit of crude oil, the "tea refining oil plant" is generally refining heavy oil with higher import sulphur content from Russia and other places.
The production of oil products with higher sulphur content, poor oil quality, has become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining the crude oil import permit, the "tea pulsing oil plant" is able to import lower sulfur content of Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, the quality of its oil products has also improved.
"With the continuous improvement of China's oil product quality standards, the ability to refining equipment has also increased," said the general oil company.
As a result, China's exports of petroleum products have gradually reached the same level as Japan (the highest quality in the world).
JX Energy said, "After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia, and formed a competition with Japanese products on the Asian market.
Despite the "Japan high-quality oil" is facing a crisis, the strategy adopted by Japanese oil companies is only to "focus on market conditions while exporting to profitable areas."
Due to the huge impact of China's exports of oil products on the Asian market, the concern for tea refining plants is also increasing.

The UV rays not only make the students' skin darker, but also damage the skin, how to make the skin to successfully pass the military training without being sunburned?
The sunscreen packaging is generally labeled with SPF and PA, SPF refers to the sunscreen index, is for UVB ultraviolet rays, our common SPF index has 15, 30, 50, etc.
The product labeled PA is targeted to UVA, so sunscreen will play a more effective role, usually in the case of PA strength + to indicate that more + to indicate the effective protection time to extend.
Oily skin should choose water-based sunscreens with more permeability, and sunscreen sprays are also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose sunscreens from frosting; neutral skin is generally without strict regulations, any maintenance products on sensitive skin wipes are a burden, it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, as it takes time for sunscreen products to penetrate completely into the skin.
Military training has a long time, sunscreen every two hours to have a lasting effect, don't be lazy.
As the skin has just been irritated by the sun, do not use whitening products immediately.
After the military training, if there are any conditions, you can use a towel wrapped in ice to burn the skin of the town to reduce local dryness.
During the exhibition, the farmers who buy the machine will continue to implement the incremental subsidies policy, and the farmers who buy the machine can get up to 40% subsidies.
This exhibition is aimed at the global investment recruitment, especially to increase the invitation to the "Belt and Road" along the country and target market countries.
This exhibition strives to complete 60 investment contracts, to introduce $2.2 billion, to sign more than 160 trade contracts, the contract amount is $3.2 billion.
It is reported that "xiangbo" for seven consecutive years, due to the strong foundation of manufacturing industry in Nandi, Hunan Province, has a long history of industrial development.
As the headquarters of the Xiangbo Fair, Tiandi has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
"xiangbo" has become an important platform for local cultivation and development of specialty industries, and to promote the development of specialty industries out of the country.
At night, the electrode layer is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go further.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in copying this effect, according to the August 11 website of the Mass Science Monthly.
Although having a stable large number of free electrons out of the electrode layer can help people listen to the radio in the broadcast range of a university radio station, it may not be an interest of the U.S. Air Force.
The electrode-filled layer means that the radio used by the military has a greater range of transmission, and it may provide some protection for GPS signals to protect them from solar storms.
The ultimate goal could be to build a series of cubic satellites based on demand, which can enhance the ionization layer when needed.
First of all, the team that signed the contract with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry data show that in 2015, the total capacity of coal production was nearly six billion tons, and the national capacity of coal production was over 18 billion tons.
In the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of 5 notice of the elimination of excess and post-production capacity.
Although the first four times are not targeted to the coal industry, the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, Qinhuangdao 5500 charcoal power-driven coal prices hovered at a long-term low of 370 yuan / ton, and 90% of coal companies fell into losses.
Since February, the price of coal has gradually recovered, recently Qinhuangdao power coal prices have been continuously rising four weeks, rising to a height of 16 months, once rising to 436 yuan per ton, nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
With the price of the rise, all walks of life are concerned about the production: a group of small coal mines will not return to work again?
In this regard, China (Hainan) Institute of Reform and Development, the head of the economy of Qianming, conducted an analysis and interpretation.
De-production can cause a high concern from all parties, and the results of today's announcement of the coal industry to production capacity are actually more worried.
The factors of these three surface layers also reflect the reasons for the relative success of our growth in the past, that is, the government-led growth mode has not been fundamentally changed so far.
Second, this is also directly related to the promotion of local governments, in the process of production capacity, funds and corresponding supporting measures should be in place, from this point of view, the differences in different regions are really larger.
Third, if some provinces with relatively slow progress in the second half of the year, they may face a greater risk.
In such a case, the process of relying on central bonus funds to promote productivity may have a negative impact.
First of all, the production capacity is not a simple total control.
Our goal is to improve the structure and restructure the whole coal industry by eliminating the backward production capacity.
In the process of deployment of the production capacity, local governments must combine the production capacity with the transformation of the coal industry, and vigorously develop related services.
Second, in order to complete this year's production capacity task, we also need to take full advantage of the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we want to strengthen the role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to employment issues, we want to strengthen the employment skills training for employees and employees.

The channel flow through the financial and rural counties and Rencheng District, through the Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Jing Hang Grand Canal, a total length of 19 km.
The transformation of two channels began construction in February 2011, and in January 2015, the completion of the transfer of labor and acceptance, investment construction and operation of the main body of the logistics service center of Jining Anping Canal.

The Bama River, the Old Manfu River, the North Grand River and other branches of the channel adopt pure market operation.
The state's financial expenditures can not meet the needs of construction, restricting the progress of the upgrade of the channel.
Social funding for the construction of public infrastructure in line with the requirements of national policy, but also become a way to crack the funding bottle.
The performance of Ningxia in the 100m freestyle semifinals has made many Chinese audiences speechless.
In the 50m freestyle race, Ningxia once again refreshed people's bottom line.
In fact, the 50-metre free swim is not a Ningxia project, and his performance and best achievements at the Kazan World Championship, also determined that he had little chance to break through the project.
Of course, the Hong Kong authoritative media, The Grand Press, revealed that the biggest reason for Ningxia's loss was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors in the field may have had a big impact on his future ideas, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment circle.
After the Kazan World Championship, Ningzexia became a net red in an instant by virtue of its ultra-high value and good achievements.
Therefore, the so-called "national husband", "small meat", "like beautiful man" and so on has also become a label on his body.
A variety of business activities to find the door, good money, to become a golden flash of the road.
In this case, Ningzeyao even chose to retire at this time to join the entertainment circle, not only his freedom, but also a seemingly feasible way.
After all, he is only 23 years old, and after some learning, he can fully rely on his popularity to perform one or two TV shows.
However, it is important to note that it is sufficient to compare itself to those of the previous generations.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the 21-year-old Liu has come to the end of the athlete's career.
The appearance of Liu Yuli has been quickly remembered and laid the foundation for her to enter the military entertainment circle in the future.
After his retirement, Liu Jing starred in a series of TV shows and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in two Olympic games in a single-person 10-meter table and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
But after losing to the team friend Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympics alone, Tian Liang's competitive state declined, and was expelled by the diving team.
He and his daughter participated in a mosaic program such as "where to go", and even let him win the eyeball.
The former gymnastics gold generation, Yang Wei, Li Xiaoye, and Chen Yi Ice, all participated in various medieval programs.
It is worth noting that Yu Wei Li Xiaofu led China to win the 2008 Olympic Men's Championship, Yu Wei even twice to get the personal gold medal, known as the Almighty King.
At the same time as leading China to win the 2012 Olympic team champion, Chen Yi ice was also the king of hangling.
After losing gold and silver at the London Olympics, a great move made him lose his lap.
But the main energy of these athletes at present is still in the field, for the medieval show is just like dragonfly water - it is to walk.
However, regardless of whether you are retired or active athletes, you will need to get the results of the entertainment circle to be guaranteed.
In the end, athletes have entered a new field, whether it is capacity or the human race, it is a blank state.
Even if Tian Liang and Liu Jing have so mixed circles of "old people" for many years, the general audience raised them, more or think of their performance at the Olympic Games.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiaoye and other newcomers, introduced at the Mitsui program, there is no exception is the "Olympic champion".
Compared to the above, the name of a swimming world champion is slightly thin.
In addition, compared to the success of Tian Liang, Liu, Yan Wei and other people, if at the age of 23, sports career a slight setbacks in the rapid decline, the negative impact on its image is probably unmeasurable.
After all, the athlete, the requirements of people are "not to win hundreds of battles, but not to be afraid of danger," and Ningxia is far from this point a lot.
Ten thousand steps back, Ningxia has long been able to fully rely on the color value to get thousands of brain dust support.
No point of strength, just by the appearance, want to be mixed in the entertainment circle, this difficulty is more difficult than good training to find the status of the response.
The road of life is all based on personal wishes, but in the end, how to choose, there should be a number in the heart.
On the surface, social media platforms have expanded the circle of communication, reducing people's feeling of loneliness.
Social networking is becoming more and more widespread, not only replacing traditional phone calls, but even entering the real life circle of the Internet, and quietly changing the social life of the people today.
The benefits of social networking online are obvious, such as fast and easy, so it is especially vulnerable to the youth.
A survey of college students' social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours per day using their phones, and daily life is basically "not in their hands."
"Social networks have the characteristics of low cost, high transmission speed, and multiple people interacting at the same time, in line with the needs of modern university students."
Expanding the adult relationship circle, a more equal dialogue, to avoid social anxiety, is the main reason we are deeply in love.
The newcomer who just entered the company loves to communicate with colleagues online, "Because the newcomer is not familiar with the unit, through the social platform to praise comments, the relationship is much closer than before."
Love to make friends often communicate online, "Previously friends because some mistakes may not be contacted for some time, and then in a large group of conversations before a few words are more hot."
IT engineer Wu said that the deep network of social friends, most of his social life on the Internet, more than the number of friends online.
Wu also expresses himself more "like fish water" on the network.
"You can reply to friends at your own convenience, because there are a lot of time to take the words, the expression can be clearer."
"You've hidden me under the ID to avoid the face of interpersonal collisions, not only have the room to spin, but even give each other more time and space to think."
"People with different identities have the same right to speak and the same efficiency, real life social anxiety, in the network space seems to be eliminated one by one."
However, Xiao Yu, a friend of wu said, the words in life are a "interesting man".
Little ke and wu speak in a large group of people to meet, because both of them are active speakers, soon to be familiar with it.
Xiao fu felt that the sentence with the network if two people, speech is boring, does not take the initiative to comment, turn over a few sentences, "I'm afraid, good, right, or not," if not "this I want to check on the Internet."
Lishui police have been involved in the investigation, and the Lishui traffic department will also increase efforts to remediate the illegal operation of vehicles.
"The police of the conflict on August 4 did not investigate the results, and on August 11 00:00, the other two drivers' taxis were smashed in the living room."
"Most of the three-wheeled vehicles are illegally operating at night, and I hope that the competent authorities can also increase their efforts for remediation."
The South China Sea Network reporters learned from the public security bureau of Lingshui Li Autonomous County that the police have now accepted the reports of the two cases, the cause of the two cases, who, whether related or not are in further investigation.
In the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Transportation and Transport of Greenland began refining illegally operated passenger tricycles, taking a total of 613 illegally operated passenger tricycles.
Next, the traffic department will apply to the county government, and the joint multi-department efforts of the county-wide tricycles, motorcycles, black cars and other illegal operation vehicles for remediation.

According to Mr. Chen, the leader of the class of Huang Yilin, Mr. Huang Yilin is known as the "classmaster" of Banli, and is happy to help.

Northeastern Tigers are currently listed as endangered species by the World Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
According to the Jilin Forestry Bureau, in 1998, the United States and Russia jointly monitored data show that Jilin Province only has 4 to 6 wild northeast tigers, and 3 to 5 northeast leopards.
In recent years, Jilin Province has been increasing the protection of wild animals, and the number of North East Tigers and North East Panthers in China is growing significantly, and the distribution area is expanding.
In 2015, the latest monitoring data showed that only 27 wild northeast tigers were monitored in Jilin Province and 42 northeast leopards.

Sunfu firmly as a party leader cadres, the ideal belief is lost, serious violation of the party's discipline, and the party's eighteen-year-old still does not collect, do not hold hands, the top of the crime, the character is bad, the situation is serious.
After the case happened, after several media reports, it became a focus case, and the social impact was very bad.
After the case occurred, the leadership of the Haikou Municipal Public Security Bureau Criminal Police Force has a high degree of attention, and immediately organized a team of strong police force to initiate a investigation.
The police immediately evacuated the suspect from the Internet, took a number of measures to prosecute the suspect, and consulted with the foreign police to investigate the whereabouts of a king.
As the suspect is a robbery offender, he is attacked by the public security organs, has a stronger anti-monitoring ability, coupled with his long-term drug use, frequently asked drug addiction, the trial work is very difficult.
The Greenland whale, also known as the small sleeping shark, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic waters surrounding Greenland and Iceland, and its population is between 4 and 5 meters long at the time of adulthood.
But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm long in a year, which suggests that the Greenland shark may have a very long life.
Traditional methods of yearning usually use tungsten ridges in animals, and some sharks can use tungsten ridges, but these tungsten ridges are rare in Greenland.
From a new study led by Ulysses Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, to a year of radiocarbon monitoring using the eye crystals of the Greenland Sharks.
This method was previously used to determine the age of sharks, but it is used to determine whether the age of sharks and other species of fish is the first time.
Their analysis shows that the largest shark population is estimated to be 392 years old and the error is 120 years old.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and may be up to 512 years old.
In addition, the female's Greenland shark is said to be able to mature when it is about 4 meters long, which means that it is at least 156 years old.
The researchers therefore wrote in the paper that Greenland Tuna is the most known and longest-lived vertebrate animal on Earth, surpassing the previous long-lived crown vertebrae (211 years old).
Over the past year, the exchange results have been significant, the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, and it has also laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB.
From the market performance, a year, the RMB exchange rate double-directional floating feature is obvious, the exchange rate flexibility is enhanced, the exchange rate is expected to be overall flat.
To date, RMB has seen a surge in the upward and downward movements of the dollar's mid-price over 100 points, but the process has increased inversely.
Last year's "8·11" exchange before the conversion was implemented in 2005, the RMB has gained significant value in the U.S. dollar for ten years.
Since the implementation of the new exchange, the RMB has changed the previous appreciation status, and the mid-year RMB exchange rate value is about 8%.
On 1 October this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will officially accept RMB and become the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) weighted currency.
This week, the statistics released by the General Administration of Customs of China showed that in the first seven months of this year, the total value of imports and exports of China was RMB 13.21 trillion, down 3% from the same period last year.
In July, China's total imports and exports decreased by just 0.9% year-on-year, especially 2.9% year-on-year.

Among them, the export of RMB1.22 billion, increased by 2.9%; the import of RMB8733 billion, decreased by 5.7%; the trade surplus of RMB342 billion, increased by 34%.

Japan's Prime Minister Abe San will attend the 6th Africa Development Conference in Kenya in late August, according to China's "News Summit" report.
The Africa Development Conference is dominated by Japan, and the previous five meetings are held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan. Therefore, the conference will also be the first time to migrate to Africa.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan said that the meeting in Africa helped to raise concerns about Japan in Africa and Europe.
In response to Abe's three-day visit, the Japanese Communist Party will send members to the relevant countries.
The road to Japan's "entertainment" began in the early 90's, and the African Development Conference, which started in 1993, was not a coincidence!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, is an important United Nations ticket store, Japan wants to "enter the routine", and how to abandon Africa?
It will also exchange views with relevant countries on the "Islamic State" and terrorist activities of the extremist organization.
"Western Group" will visit 7 countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea Bissau and others.
Japan's foreign minister Kagoshima has also recently announced the intention of the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council.
Abe has announced that in five years the assistance will be provided for the stability of the sub-Saharan African countries (RMB 61 billion).
The observers generally believe that Japan's generosity towards Africa has two main purposes: First, to increase Japan's sense of existence in Africa, and second, to win the support of African countries on entry to common problems.
Japan's experts analyze, "From the political point of view, Africa, although relatively developed, but the number of countries is more, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called "Big Ballot Field"."
In the future, Japan will not give up, and the work of Africa will not end, and will continue to strengthen.
Economic aspects, because Japan has a relatively high production capacity, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of child ageing, the domestic need to be relatively low.
However, from 10 years ago to 10 years after the Abe Abe, Japan has repeatedly launched a "shocking", but all of them return.
Japan's problem expert, Mr. Yang, thinks that Japan's intention is always at a glance, but it is difficult to enter the usual situation.
Japan in order to achieve its goal, first of all, to have a good relationship with the surrounding countries, whether it is geopolitical rivalry or in national disputes and historical awareness, Japan needs to have a right attitude.

Zhang Qi, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Wang Lu, attended the seminar.
During his 14-year career, Dun Yaping won 18 world champions, becoming the first to win four Olympic gold medals in China's Olympic history.
She has been ranked the world's longest female sportsman in table tennis history for eight consecutive years, and is ranked the world's longest in the history of table tennis.

Since then, Tian Liang has been constantly advertising slogans, but also in recent years has played an important role such as "burr", "repeat" and other important roles.
Many NBA players have demonstrated their own strength, but some progress has fallen.
Whether it's due to age or time constraints, there will be some players showing up in each season.
Of course, some "back-up" may be just a data shrink, and the power of these players may not decrease.
Even though weed is still one of the best scoring backers in the league, his performance of bulls should not be hot.
He and Rondo have a limited range, when the star Butler's three-point hit rate is only 32.8%, which will make their next season's attack very congested.
When it comes to wind city, lightning has to give the ball power more to Butler and Rondo, and it is likely that they will choose to fight for their livelihood in regular competitions.
Okaford's situation was rather embarrassing, and as the first choice for the 76ers in last season, he had to put time and ball power in the new season with Simmons as well as the competition with Embed.
The competition may not come soon enough, and Simmons also needs to adapt to the NBA tournament, and Embed also needs to be completely recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but Okafu can have a position or problem in the 76-person long-sleeved squad.
Last season, 32% of Okaford's scores came from low-level offensives, which were higher than Kosins, Wuchwich, and Brook Lopez, while his usage was also higher than the league's top 40.
With Simmons already showing the potential of excellent control, Embide also has a body that is more suitable for NBA games, and Okaford's position is more difficult to stabilize.
In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage has stabilized in the league's top 20, which is also the best two seasons in his career.
However, the problem is that with the arrival of the Tudor, the usage of Toppson will definitely decrease, which will affect his performance.
This effect will not only affect the number of hands, the Toto God's ball attack will certainly be greatly reduced in the next season, which in some respects will also reduce the difficulty of his opponents against his defense.
The arrival of the Tuvalu is sure to drown the players' data, but the biggest fear of these drowning is the Toppson.
But that doesn't mean that Toby's level retreats are more like he sacrificed the whole team.
Parker performed better than the data reflected in last season, not only because his basket was the highest in his career, but his and Aldridge's chemical reactions also benefited the marshmallows.
Duncan retired and Ginobili declared a year of war again, and the combination of GDP finally came to an end, as the youngest of three, and there was not much oil in the fuel tank of the French sports car.
After getting the third overall champion ring, only Jabal, Jordan, and Laserby James won more regular tournaments MVP, while Jordan was the only FMVP more than James.
James just brought Cleveland's first professional sports championship in the last 52 years.
James, who came to the 14th season of his career, needed better physical strength to prepare for the postseason.
As a result, James' data is likely to slip further, and he will put more weight on Eurovision to take on it, but he will still easily become the top three players of the league.

In the seven-seater rugby finals on Thursday night, the British team failed to continue their outstanding performance in the face of the Fijian team, which was defeated by the Fijian team at Riotio Doro stadium with 43 to 7 times.
The Fiji team won the gold medal with an impeccable performance in control of the ball, smashing, avoiding, cooperating, running and strength, the first Olympic medal in the country's history.
Silver is a great comfort for the defeated British team, the third silver that the British delegation received on the day. This achievement is enough to make the British Rugby proud: they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on their first visit to the Olympics.
Earlier that day, the British won South Africa with 7 vs. 5, which could affect their status in the finals.
But in any case, the current Fijian team is enough to defeat a full-fledged team of 15.
Tomorrow, at least one British will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort for the British team, but it may not be. The British is the main coach of the Fijian team from Wembley, Ben Ryan, who has served as the main coach of the British team.
It is not easy for the UK to achieve results today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's teaching, they had not won the Adelaide Sevens at the International Rugby Sevens.
They are now only a few steps away from the front.
Even though they were attacked, they also made great strides.
The opening of Fiji takes advantage of the British forces without any enmity.
For Tom Mitchell and his team, it's like hitting a bunch of running buses. When Ossi Corinneso stepped into the corner area, the World Series Championship was already ahead of the line with a score of 5 to 0.
The game took only four minutes, and Jerry Twist scored again on the right wing.
12 to 0, the British team almost never hit the ball.
Michelle's strength prevented the Giants from having a third score, but this was just slowing down Fiji's score.
At 7 minutes, Aza Wailemaru touched the ground on the right. 17 to 0, the British team froze.
The first half of the game is still 1 minute.
Then, Valmo Ravovo broke the defensive line of the British team and went straight to the scoring line.
When the intermission is at rest, the score is already 29 to 0.
The Fijians were born to play 7 rugby, while the British team was still the first to emerge.
This is the case.
The British team made a big change in the second half and hit the line against the Fijian in four minutes, which was a good performance in the first half. But then the Fijian team played a wonderful match, which was again scored by Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton created the opportunity for the British team to score points, he touched the left corner and changed the score to 36 to 7, but the game has already been under the control of the South China Sea island, their fans singing loudly on the site, splashing flags, and dancing.
The impressive performance of the Fijian team has to be fast-paced.
At the end of the day, Matta Williams stopped an unannounced attack by the Fijian team.
At the end of the whistle, the Fijians hug together, and the successful British forces can only regret their resignation.
Earlier that day, the Fiji team defeated the Japanese team with 20 to 5 in the semi-finals, while the UK took the risk of winning the South African team in a fierce semi-final match.
In the first half, Kel Brown helped South Africa lead the team, but Dan Norton broke his score in the second half with excellent footfalls.
After that, Anthony's brother, Marcus Watson, used a wonderful interception to ensure the victory of the team, and eventually the British won the silver medal.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning are inspired by cancer-causing trainers to win the gold medal of the raceboat
Needless to say, this is the most exciting piece of gold.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning have been trained for 220 penalties since the first draft, and the gold they earned at Estacio da Lagoa has a more extraordinary meaning.
Although only the two of them were swayed, there was a person on board - the coach Robin Williams - who had been accompanied by them to hit the second consecutive women's doubles at the Olympic Games, the British first team to reach this height of the women's rowing.
They have maintained 39 non-stop records and have a absolute advantage.
What we see is that the two genius athletes move gracefully on the water, but this is not the whole of the victory.
There are many people who have volunteered behind each of the gold medals, and it is their constant dedication to create a difference, and the biggest help is to know that a person who has cancer 30 months ago does not know whether or not he can live to see the trainer of the day.
As he said, death may come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they had surgery for me.
If surgery is not performed, the cancer cells expand to the whole body.
In this way, the situation will be much worse.
This will change your opinion a little.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment at the beginning of 2014 and had the lowest impact, although in such a case it might not be appropriate.
I need to get my salary, so I need to get it fast.
This is an incentive for me.
I live in the hospital, although they say walking a few steps is enough, I walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet every time I walk in the ward.
This is the starting point of all things.
Sailing is a journey in itself, which makes this journey a little longer.
At the time of the withdrawal, they first thought of Williams. Williams was a little talkative this morning, in order to overcome his anxiety.
"I feel bad this week, may be a bit extreme, but the gold is truly remarkable," she said.
It repeatedly told me how important it was to me, how much I, Helen, and Robin have done.
I have worked with Helen, Robin and I for three years.
If we don't have Robin, we're just anonymous, thank you very much, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't find any better trainers and trainers than him.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning have not failed in five years.
The penalties for this combination are not comparable to that of their counterparts.
Even at the last 500 meters, the New Zealand team and the Danish team began to approach, and Stanin and Graff still have a lot of physical energy reserves.
At the time, it was really amazing.
Helen said, "Keep the pace and keep the pace."
It is very important not to be affected.
We have a good start, and we haven't been looking forward to anything amazing.
We didn't think of today's glory, we just wanted to draw and win each and every game, and we did it.
It took a year for the group to decide its own future.
Next month, Graff will be married to TV addict Steve Buckshal.
But now, she just wants to enjoy it.
I don't think this is my last game.
This is going to put too much pressure on me.
In London, I spent about six months realizing that I was the Olympic champion.
It was a whole new experience and I was very excited.
It has now been about 4 minutes.
She said, "I feel a lot."

Snapchat's "Moving" effect was irritated by Asians
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by moving, but some observers thought it was racist.
150 million daily Snapchat users can change reality through their filters and turn people into funny.
You can turn yourself into a character in a pineapple, a dog, or a picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
These lenses have the effect of tanning and mellow features, producing more than 30 million self-portraits that have been refined every day.
Any errors will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for being played as black or as beautiful as white skin.
So, when the app provided a filter for some users to create eyelash, odd teeth, and face effects this week, some commentators referred to it as racism against Asia's "yellow man".
They even think that these repeated problems mean that the company has a larger problem with diversity.
The Verge and Motherboard report sparked anger after Snapchat said it removed the feature on Wednesday.
The company explained that the filter is a tribute to the moving character, not the irony of Asians.
But for those who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the stereotypes that are damaging in reality.
Others are also opposed to this image.
A Korean American artist who posted a Twitter post on these photos and was widely shared in an email said these filters "at least it's annoying and uncomfortable."
She added: "It's hard to differentiate the effects of highly irritating Asian irritating images and filters."
Although the filter is not just a yellow person, the yellow person is extremely low.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches the bottom line of these cultures.
From the board of directors of the company to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat is a large group of young people who may be sensitive because they are more concerned about racial diversity than they were before.
When a Snapchat filter creates an image that insults the user, 25-year-old Juliet (translated) said in an interview on Thursday: "This kind of thing is harder to escape than before."
On Thursday, Ms. Chu, who served as Product Manager and Engineer at Medium, decided to remove her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article written for Medium and a telephone interview, she said that she considered racial racism to reflect the lack of racial diversity in Snapchat during the recruitment process.
Ms. Chu criticized the company's staff mostly white, leadership all men and added a tag at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese American, Ms. Chu said: "Or that their employees do not have a variety of people, so they can make such a decision, or that some of their employees have some people of color, but their positions cannot let them speak what they want."
Other observers shared her complaints that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company does not publish data on employee diversity and indicates that it is a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its employees, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter who was particularly responsible for the work of people with a lower proportion of internal and promoting internal inclusion.
Ms. Chu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I want to know if they need more users like us to oppose this behavior."
The U.S. military officials have distorted ISIS
A parliamentary group said in a Thursday report that the U.S. Central Command's officials changed the report, describing the war situation in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than the actual situation.
The interim report comes from a special working group formed by the President of the National Defense Sub-Committee of the House of Representatives, the Information Committee and the House of Representatives. The report says that the Central Command Intelligence Analysts are "widely dissatisfied" and these analysts say that the superiors are tampering with their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
The Central Command (Centcom), located in Tampa, Florida, is a military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report on the report, "The intelligence reviewed by the Central Command's senior leadership is more optimistic than the actual situation and always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies."
"The actions of the Central Command are unacceptable," said the California Republican Party representative. "On the one hand, our warriors suffer from war, and on the other hand, the senior policymakers receive wrong analyses."
The leadership issues of the Central Commander-in-Chief have been extended to the highest level of the institution.
The report details the long-standing problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing the U.S. training of Iraqi troops.
While there is no evidence of certainty that the Obama administration's senior officials ordered to change these reports, according to the report, these analysts felt pressured from the central commander-in-chief to force them to give more optimistic views on the threat of Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
"In the first half of 2015, many central commanders' press releases, statements and congressional statements were much more optimistic than the actual situation," the report said.
For example, an officer of a central commander-in-chief publicly stated that it was likely to take a major military action to retrieve Mosul as early as possible in April or May 2015.
Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party of Kansas, said in a statement: "After several months of investigation, the result has been very clear."
From the mid-2014 to the mid-2015, most senior intelligence officers of the U.S. Central Command manipulated the intelligence products of the Command, tantamount to the threat of Iraqi Islamic State.
The Republican Party established a special working group after it learned from the analyst that the information about the Islamic state was manipulated.
As the investigation continues, there will be more to be found after the report published on Thursday.
The Defense Attorney General also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Members of the Democratic Party of the House Intelligence Committee published their findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Special Working Group.
In a statement, the Democratic Party leader said: "From 2014 to 2015, the Central Command has developed an oversimplified process for evaluating the intelligence of Islamic and Iraqi forces."
Mr. Xie Anda said the process "impeded the release of intelligence", reduced analyst morale and "unacceptable views."
But Mr. Shayanda and the Democrats also said that they did not find any evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on analysts at the Central Command, and then their conclusions were "predictive or political."
The Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that after receiving a complaint from the Central Command Analyst, the Pentagon Attorney General began to investigate.
Mr. Patrick Evans, Spokesperson for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defense did not comment on the Congress report until the investigations of the Chief Prosecutor were not over.
"Experts sometimes have disagreements over the interpretation of complex data, while the intelligence agencies and the Defense Department encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security topics," he said.
The investigation has overtaken the U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria (and more and more national defense officials claim).
But last year, these initiatives raised the public to question how much President Obama could rely on the military action assessments of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other critical regions issued by the Central Command.
Criticism of Islamic intelligence evokes controversy more than a decade ago, when the Central Command Intelligence Analyst Gregory Huck wrote a research article that pointed out that the government of George Bush, regardless of the opposition of many analysts, insisted to send small-scale forces to Iraq and barely considered the case after the invasion in 2003.
Mr. Huck played a key role in this campaign against Islamic intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hulk's team concluded that the airstrike against the Islamic refining plant did not significantly reduce the economic income of the terrorist organization, because the terrorist organization built the temporary refining plant to continue to sell oil on the black market, which is a very different court from the statement published.
According to the September report of TIMES Magazine, the Central Command has not released the discovery.
After several attorneys reviewed the testimony of the Senate in an overexpected review of the war, the Central Command commander, Lloyd Austin, was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Waterer in his position at the Central Command.
The U.S. won four rounds in women's hockey and will win with the UK
Kate Bam, who won 6 to 1 in Japan, was the first to win a second round of the U.S. women's hockey team on Thursday, helping the U.S. to beat the Indian team with 3 to 0.
The two-game five-game goal is amazing, but the 27-year-old Bam says she doesn't know how to perform so well.
She said: "I don't know about that."
I'm not the kind of person who remembers a few games.
She knows that the U.S. team has won four consecutive games at the Olympics and will compete with the team in the United Kingdom who has not won the team after winning the Japanese team by 2 to 0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States met on Saturday's final round.
Both teams have a quarter-final cast, which will determine who will appear as the team's first.
Getting the team's first team will avoid encountering strong Dutch teams, so as to be able to go further. The Dutch team will take off as another team's first team.
On Saturday's race, the U.S. team created a miracle with amazing performance. At the London Olympics four years ago, the U.S. team ended up in 12 teams.
Bam was also in the team at the time.
Bam grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a hockey stick at age 3 (her twin sister in Drakessell) and joined the national team at age 16 and became the youngest national team member to date.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics because she was unable to join the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not well looked after.
In the second year, Britain's Craig Panam as the coach, everything began to change.
"It's a cultural, mental and material change," Bam said.
We have not yet reached our current level in London.
We have a complete and complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam pulled off the head in the first half with a close-up shot.
India has not won anything in this game yet, but the team has demonstrated an amazing struggle and keeps the score of 1 to 0 until the end of Section 3, when Bam broke out.
She took the ball along the left side of the ball, then cut to midway, pumped into the net, the United States 2 is 0 ahead.
Melissa Gonzalez shot the last ball in the fourth quarter.
For the first time in this match, Jackie Briggs, the United States rivals, in the first three wins, each of them into a ball.
This is an overworked one.
Bam is too.
"We're in a good state now," Panam said. "But how good it is to be depends on the results of the Saturday game.
Cold and cold foods during the period of the Great Depression in the "Rich Meal"
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected President, sat down for lunch at the President's office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt prefers the 5th Avenue food, such as hemp livers and Maryland snorkelfish.
On that day, his menu was very simple: the Tomato Sauce Devil's eggs, potato mud and fruit pudding.
"It's for the sake of being able to work with people who are suffering in food," said Zigman.
Her husband, Andrew Ke, added, "This also reflects the way Americans eat."
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are food historian.
Mr. Ke's previous book, The Stir-fried Mixed Vegetables, is about American Chinese cuisine, and Ms. Zigman tells the life stories of the tenants of the poor in her 97 Fruits book.
The new book, Rich Meals, will be published on Tuesday by Harper Press, presents the American food history of the Great Depression period.
After presenting some common insights on food, they met with a journalist at the sandwich shop in Eisenberg. This simple lunch counter in the Iron Quarter has been open for business since the start of the economy in 1929.
Ms. Zigman, 54, points to a cream cheese mixed with olive sandwich, while Mr. Ke, 57, points to a turkey, potato mud and vegetable platter.
According to a press release, the husband and wife think that these dishes are suitable for discussion of the diet of the Great Depression period.
Ms. Zigman said, "The bread was very popular at the time."
There are peanut bread, liver bread, soybean bread.
They are all made with a raw material and a cheap head that can be immersed in the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is peanuts.
Mr. K appeared as a strange figure.
He said, "They will be like a lead in your stomach."
In the years before the Great Depression, the United States was a buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women are cooking for men's farm workers, breakfast, lunch and dinner are just some of the biscuits.
During World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to the hungry Europeans. Rich Meals recorded how the country suddenly ceased to be a rich land.
Mr. Co explained why he and his wife were writing this book: "At that time, food has become a major topic that makes Americans uncomfortable."
Another unpleasant topic is the cold and new food: "Fantastic food" such as bread and cabbage becomes the main dish, and cabbage is the "best way to cook leftovers," Ms. Zigman said, which is because the chefs can use the cream in the sauce to cover difficult ingredients.
Fresh fruits are replaced by cheap dried fruits.
The meat that has been at the American table for many years has become a rare luxury.
Strangely enough, the first thing people think of is nutrition, rather than taste, or even basic cooking habits.
In the process of researching this book, including a variety of recipes, Ms. Zigman produced a roasted onions filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, "It's not common at the dinner table."
Ms. Zigman said: "It's also strange."
Peanut oil and pancakes are not compatible at all.
This is a feature of many family meals.
The family economists influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as the chief cook of the Federal Family Economy from 1923 to 1943, which was unique in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encourage women to "expect" and be brave to turn bad food such as creamy pasta with husks.
A rich meal is a rich "history".
It is particularly interesting that the government's response to the hungry people, such as President Herbert Hoover, "I can't control other people's things."
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse when he was young, his diet was as refined as a millionaire.
Mr. Ke said, "He likes to eat European-style meals, such as fish with cucumbers."
He was dressed in an evening dress and had dinner at a golden restaurant.
He was obviously out of the people.
If his wife Eleanor encouraged him to set an example on his diet, President Roosevelt might make the same mistake.
As the book says, Ms. Roosevelt has no interest in the taste, so "food in the White House is not only the most difficult food in Washington, but also the worst food to cook."
When the United States returned to normal, many of the cooking methods of the Great Depression were abandoned.
Ms. Zigman said that what we left behind is our focus on calories and nutrition, as well as the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they learned more about the eating habits of Ms. Zigman's mother, such as how she did not abandon food.
"She's afraid of wasting food," Mr. Co said.
Ms. Zigman recalls: "She actually made a lot of lives sick."
For example, a "cream puff" event occurred.
After removing the plate, she presented a dessert they had prepared at home with Mr. Ke: this was the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
Ms. Zigman said: "It's called creamy fruit," and added that the name of a new trend for a common dish is "Usually used for both."
There are no raw creams in this dessert, only fruit juices, a little powder, sugar, water and cinnamon.
It is difficult for everyone to blend deep into a sticky brown paste.
Needless to say, the taste of this dessert is right.
Mr. Ke also ate the second and third spoons.
He felt that this was an acceptable confection and told his wife, "The walnuts will be better."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continues to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia's production has hit a new high.
The report does not ban the credibility of OPEC, the oil price recovery road is still full of thorns.
On Monday, OPEC said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting at the International Energy Forum on 26-28 September.
The monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed that the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, increased production by 46,000 barrels/day in July to 3311,000 barrels/day.
OPEC also said in the monthly report that the low price of crude oil has prompted global oil refiners to produce more refined oils, thereby increasing the extent of excess supply in the market.
The impact of this news, coupled with the expected rise in U.S. crude oil production and an unexpected increase in crude oil inventory, the international oil price closed for two consecutive days.
The price of light crude oil futures delivered on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48% as of Wednesday, and the price of London Brent futures delivered in October fell by 2.07%.
According to Reuters, it is unlikely that the proposed U.S. oil country meeting will significantly tighten the supply, and the U.S. Energy Information Agency released data to undermine the popularity of the market.
Iran's daily crude oil output is the highest of 8.5 million barrels, according to Fars, the official Iranian correspondent, which has been the highest since 2008.
Russia's energy minister, Novak, said there was no need for a new round of freeze-made negotiations under the current oil price.
The last oil producer meeting was held in April, and OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measures.
BMIResearch Oil and Gas Analyst Emma Richards said the market and the media may be overreacting to the meeting that OPEC will hold.
Helima Croft, Head of Commodities Strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said the OPEC will change the mood of the market by releasing the signals that they will facilitate the agreement.
This method is like a smoke and mirror that leads to a person's sight (willfully giving a wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commodities Research, Commercial Bank of Germany, said that OPEC has a low likelihood of trying to stabilize the market through its September meeting.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization has played a "wolf".
There will be violations of medical advertising, complaints in a centralized report, and has been repeatedly punished by medical institutions as the focus of the investigation.
The National Health Accounting Commission and the State Administration of Chinese Medicine will promptly organize the supervision and inspection of some provinces.

Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby has been focusing on the vertical field of the Internet for pregnant women and doctors since the beginning.
Pregnant women can not only get free 24 hours and one-on-one consultation with a supervisor, but also pay a visit to a doctor.
On the other side of the doctor, iBaby took the organization of experts to the primary doctor to carry out online lectures, peer exchange, case studies and other forms of micro lectures, to break the geographical restrictions.

According to the media reports, Wang Lei recently said that Ali Health "willing to sink" to take the health big data.
The Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism, and the writing methods on the same terms can not be unified.
Alibaba is currently divided into three groups in the field of healthcare, namely Alibaba Health, Tianqi Medical Center, and Paybao Future Hospital.
Wang Lei said that the medical health entrepreneurship will be more difficult than other industries, "It's not only how much money, but also to calm down, to live to loneliness slowly to do."
Night after night, the olympic events can easily damage the heart.
The Brazilian Olympic Games are held as if they were on fire, and even when they were aired in the country at midnight, many people will watch them all night.
In this regard, the doctor specifically reminds that there is a health risk to watch the race at night, which may lead to cardiovascular disease.
If the hormone is still secreted for a long period of time, the human body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement, unable to get a normal recovery, easy to cause vascular shrinkage, increased blood pressure, and thus cause cardiovascular disease.
It is important to note that people with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, family history of cardiovascular risk factors, and if they stay up late, it will be easier to cause cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late, not only cardiovascular function is affected, but also stomach function, immune system, nerve endocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of developing tumours will increase.
For older friends, we recommend that you do not stay up late for the Olympic Games, especially with people with a history of cardiovascular disease.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union sent its missiles to Cuba, causing a nuclear war in the United States.
The event was seen as the peak of the Cold War, known as the Cuban Missile Crisis.
However, it is well known that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm also poses a risk for the US to start a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was only released by researchers for the first time on August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong disturbances to the U.S. military's radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic warning system for monitoring Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, was interviewed by U.S. military personnel who were involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activities and read non-confidential literature.
In order to prevent the sudden nuclear war in the Soviet Union, the US Air Force has always had a part of the war aircraft with nuclear bombs in the sky.
The U.S. military commander did not know that the coup d'état was the sunstorm, not the USSR, so he ordered the fighter jets to be ready for battle.
Fortunately, the U.S. military began its solar activity in the late 50s and its study of earth electromagnetic interference in the late 50s, which ultimately prevented the potential military conflict.
Later, he recounted the information provided by the U.S. Air Force Meteorological Department and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of the solar storm was that the United States military had treated the weather as a war concern and established a more powerful spatial weather forecast system.

Integrated public sports facilities short board
The black coal field warehouse turned into a football field of "green grass as in"; the factory building on the red barn tops turned into a modern stadium.
On the fitness day of the people, outside of Wangjiangmen, south of the Mafu Sports Culture Park, opened up the mysterious face.
It used to be a coal yard, which closed more than a decade ago, leaving a lot of illegal buildings and household waste.
After the remediation, it became a sports and cultural park, and will be officially open to the public in November, providing free sports venues to the public, and without a doubt opening up a whole new volcanic land for the sport for all.
This is not to let people think of Hangzhou's chenchen jing dynasty school, the Chinese swimming forum "Wangpu military school" out of many world champions.

In order to complement this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments in the urban planning to fully consider the layout of the stadium.
On the other hand, the public sports venues that have been built, including sports venues in schools and other units, should be as wide as possible to improve the efficiency of use.
The Rio Olympic Games, which are currently being held, inspires people's passion for sports, and awakens everyone's sense of participation.
Glyde Gets Lawyer's Fee in the Battle with Merck's Hepatitis C Patent
According to U.S. District Judges, Gilled Scientific Corporation has the right to obtain the attorney's fees incurred in the treatment of the American Merck Group's Proprietary Proprietary Litigation.
In June, a U.S. judge found out that Merck Company was in violation of any other unethical act, including falsifications and other unethical acts, Gilead is exempted from paying a $2 billion in compensation for the two patents of Sofwell and Havoni, a best-selling pharmaceutical product by Gilde, in violation of Merck's two patents.
In a Thursday trial, U.S. District Judge Bes Rambosson Freeman said Gideon would not be responsible for the costs incurred for defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilled, the next generation of hepatitis C drugs market. Gilled's drugs can cure more than 90% of people with hepatitis.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gideon and Merck sued each other, both claiming to be the active ingredient in Gideon's medicine - the owner of the laboratory work of Sophie Buvey.
U.S.-backed forces announce that they have taken back the Manbi season from the hands of Islamic states
A spokesman for the U.S. forces said Friday that the remaining Islamic soldiers in the city had all left, and the U.S.-backed forces have fully control over the northern city of Manbi season near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the city after the radicals who hide in the city leave.

He told the Reuters: "Manbi season is now under our control, but we are still in slump."
Clinton's wife earned $1075 million in 2015, paying 34.2% federal tax
Hillary Clinton released his 2105 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax.
In 2015, the Clinton couple's charity donation amounted to $1 million, most of which donated to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech fee reached nearly $35 million, while former Secretary of State with a book about her tenure in the State Council received $3 million from the publisher Simon and Schulter.
Clinton's running partner, Virginia Federal Senator Tim Cain and his wife, Anne Holton, released a 10-year tax return.
Both of them paid 20.3% federal tax in 2015.
In a statement, Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmery said, " Hillary Clinton and Tim Cain will continue to be a benchmark for financial transparency."
Contrary to what was formed, Donald Trump covered and reclaimed the promise of his previously published tax return for false reasons.
Although the law does not require it, it is customary for US presidential candidates to open their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump, and his attorney, audited the U.S. IRS as a reason for refusing to publish a tax return.
Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams tweeted that you were the boss and included a link to the Democratic candidate's tax return.
On Thursday, Trump's special legal advisor, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release a tax return until the audit is complete.
Criticizing Trump's people, including Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, and other Republicans, said Trump's refusal to announce the return would raise questions about its net worth of capital, charitable donations, commercial transactions, and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton seized the subject with intense stimulus and released a video on Friday, highlighting the high-profile Democrats urge Trump to announce its tax situation.
On Thursday, she raised this question in a speech on economic policy in Michigan.
She said to the crowd: "For decades, he has refused to publish his own tax return like other presidential candidates."
According to the News of the Politician, Trump did not pay a single dollar of tax for nearly two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist cited a number of tax lawyers and accounting firms on Friday, saying that the current situation may still be the case.
Federal tax has become a major issue in the presidential election.
Clinton named it a rule by millions of investors, Warren Buffett, to ensure that people with annual income of more than 1 million dollars pay at least 30% of the tax.
The proposal was also approved by the President of the United States.
Last week, Clinton held a symposium in Omaha, Nebraska, where the Burkehill Hashavi company was located. Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange his tax return.
Warren Buffett said he was also audited by the IRS, and Trump "feared" is not a tax agency, but a voter.
The earliest tax return issued by the Clinton Campaign Group was 2007.
The average federal tax rate for married couples currently living in Chabak, New York, reached about 32% from 2007 to 2014, with a combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return shows that unlike most Americans, their wages are only $100.
Their main investment is a low-cost index mutual fund, and the dividend and interest income of the Clinton couple is $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticized Hotel Berlin to remove Israel's phone code according to the Arab customer's "request" - Reuters News
A French film producer with a Jewish heritage told the media that the Kebinsky Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone number, and the hotel staff said it was in accordance with the Arab customer's "requirements", which sparked a rumor.
The Jewish Holocaust documentary The Holocaust author Claude Lutzman expressed his disappointment at the hotel Kempinski and published an open letter in the Frankfurt Report in Germany.
During the recent stay, Lutzman wanted to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
However, Israel is not listed in the countries where guests can communicate directly from the room.
Israel disappeared in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany.
Lutzman wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel through the hotel's call center.
For an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
Lutzman said in a letter that he received at the front desk "was shocking."
The hotel staff said it was "a deliberate decision made by the hotel management of Kempinski."
The reason for this is that the filmmaker is angry.
Lutzman quote the employee's originality: most of our guests are Arabs who have asked for the code to be removed from Israel.
According to the South German Journal, Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jacov Hadas Handelsman, referred to it as a "grief of shame."
We were pleasantly surprised by this incident.
This is a huge shame in itself.
The hotel chain that takes place in Germany and the hotel is even more eye-opening.
There is no need to explain this.
"We hope that the hotel will come to the right conclusion," the official said.
The incident sparked a stimulus on the Internet, and everyone thought it was a rumor.
Some people believe that the Kempinski Hotel is simply a "blind knee" in order to meet the requirements of Arabic customers.
Another post pointed directly to the hotel "don't look at the face" and pointed out that the street on the famous Kurdamm Street is right next to a Jewish church.
The hotel quickly clarified all charges, claiming that they were all "negligent" and said "sorry" to Lutzman, according to the report of the Morningstar Weekly.
The South German Journal cited the words of the representative of Kebingski: "There has never been a direct command to remove Israel from the Quick Dial List."
The report also states that the Israeli code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to evade protests in Brazil
On Thursday, in São Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with the police in the process of protesting the reform of the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to evacuate protestors.
The incident was caused by law enforcement officials trying to disperse students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in this tour and expressed their dissatisfaction with these programs.
In order to save money, the Governor of St. Paul, Oakming, plans to close 100 public schools, and 300,000 students will transfer to the school.
Some of the students who took part in the protest expressed dissatisfaction with the provisional president, Michel Temer.
Just a few days before the recent protests took place, the protesters collectively took to the streets to support Dilma Rousseff, president of the nation's Senate.
The Scottish cyclist, Kalm Skinner, has gained a reputation for his bicycles.
The Scottish cyclist Kalm Skinner raced the men's team last night at the Rio Olympics to help the British trio successfully defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his fellow Scottish man, Sir Chris Hoy, and became a strength in the team. He was proud of the legendary cyclist when the young Skena defeated the crowned New Zealand team and was proud of it.
Four years ago, a British team was shocked, and Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was only ranked sixth in the March London World Cycling Championships, and Hoy has since retired. Then, the British team was brilliant again.
During the Beijing Olympics to London Olympics, the British team's problem was to replace the "first circle expert" Jeremy Stavt.
This was only done by the team when Sindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement also left a blank space, while Chien Imagdi and Matt Krampton wanted to fill this blank space.
After seeing the potential of Skinner, the British team of men's trainers insisted that he was elected to the national team, and Skinner eventually did not have any expectations.
Skinner's profile was four years ago with Hoe to win gold medals for Schinders and Kenny. Three people refreshed the Olympics in the qualifying race, but this achievement was surpassed by the New Zealand team in the first round.
The three British bicycle races eventually defeated their opponents and won gold medals.
Despite the abrupt decline of Sindes, Kenny took the lead in the team, and Skinner kept the leadership advantage to the end.
The change in strategy is the key to this reversal, and Schinders chose a larger liner, so the speed is slower, which allows Kenya, especially Schindler, to maintain the speed.
Hoy watched the game as a BBC Commentator. Skinner, Kenny, and Lindes saw him on the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist, Skinner, said, "It's amazing to me."
I'm just doing my best to keep my name alive.
We created an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the World Champion.
It is too hard to believe.
There is nothing better than this victory.
After winning gold with Kenny and Hoe at the 2012 London Olympics, Sinders admitted that he was intentionally falling on the track in the event of a bad start.
He later resigned, and the British forces were unable to appeal.
There is no such thing as victory.
"It's like in London, it's the British flag on the site," said Lindes.
We were only in the team three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympics.
This is only a game and a gold medal for the British team that has won 7 gold medals at the Beijing Olympics and London Olympics.
If this is a sign of progress we have made in the last five months, then we will continue to be successful in the next five days.
According to the state of Kenya, it is not possible for Hoy to have won three gold medals at an Olympic Games.
If this is the case, Bihoi is 12 years old and is also born on March 23 (this day seems to be a sacred day of British sports, and so is Steve Redgrave, Mofara, and Roger Benister) Kenny will have 6 gold medals and 1 silver medal.
This work is consistent with Hoy.
Kenny will be starting a three-day race today.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I am temporarily focusing on the game.
Teamwork is always the best.
You can win with your teammates.
To be honest, one person wins a bit of a loneliness.
"If he can win two gold medals, then he should be awarded a jazz seal," said Sinds.
It was the only game that made a medal that day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owen Düll have been promoted to four-kilometre group chases with the fastest results.
Their score is 351.943.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympic gold medalists was 351.659.
The first round and finals (10:42 p.m.) will be held on the second race day today, and Wiggins will undoubtedly be a spotlight.
Yesterday, he had a contest with the tournament officials before his qualification, when the tournament officials gave him a high profile.
In the women's team that will end tomorrow, Laura Trot, Joanna Russel Shand, Eleanor Bark, and Kate Achibold from Milgaea take a new world record at 413.260.
The British team relied on a strong field bike team to take active part in the mid-term Olympics and win multiple medals.
The British cyclists were a little disappointed when they arrived at the Beijing and London Olympics.
During the period, a number of blunders, including April technical director Sean Salton resigned because of allegations of gender discrimination and bullying, as well as his retirement from legendary characters such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night of the cycling club was enough to prove that the British team would once again play a key moment to the peak of the legend.

The head of the Industrial Coordinating Division of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out today that excessive steel production is a global problem.
In recent years, China's production utilization rate is higher than the global average, but also higher than the United States and Europe and other countries and regions.
Our country has taken strong and effective measures to eliminate surplus capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The head pointed out that on the global issue of the excessive capacity of steel production, the Party Central Committee of the State Council attaches great importance.
All departments and regions actively implement the deployment of the State Council, seriously carry out the work, this year to reduce the crude steel production capacity of about 45 million tons.
From China's national situation, China does not encourage the export of steel, but also take a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The head stressed that the international trade in steel products is essentially market behavior, which is derived from the importer's demand, the consumer overall consideration of the product value ratio and other factors after the independent choice.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the development of the global steel industry, on the contrary, will only cause further harm to the international trade order.
When talking about debt, the person in charge stressed that the problem of resolving debt is the process of resolving excess energy needs to be handled properly.
Due to the size of the assets of steel enterprises, involving a wide range of, some companies' debt relationships are complex, if not handled properly, it may lead to regional risks.
According to the responsible person, in recent years, with the pressure of the economic downturn, the social total demand is gradually weakened, some industries have reduced the utilization rate, and the production and operation of enterprises is difficult to increase.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment, production and operation is difficult to succeed or even close, but are restricted by some mechanisms, more barriers to marketization, become a "zoom enterprise."
The existence of such enterprises, distorted the market signals, reduced the efficiency of resource utilization, increased the social management costs, hindered the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main cause of losses is the same as the difficulties faced by the global steel industry - poor market demand and low productivity utilization.
China mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic means and the rule of law, the government is mainly good workers and social stability work, to ensure a fair and just market order.
The responsible person stressed that the next step, to firmly continue to grasp the depot capacity work, to ensure the completion of the five-year goal of decomposition of crude steel capacity of 100 million to 1.5 million tons.

"The question they usually ask is how to get there, where to find a monument, how to rent, and how to get back to the hotel."
In recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourism atmosphere have become better, and the attractiveness of foreign tourists has increased.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, a team of tourism police was established in July 2014, responsible for patrol protection at major tourist attractions, to help and guide tourists.

In accordance with the provisions of the Living Certificate Provisional Ordinance, the above areas are clear, the first time to apply for a residence certificate, and the documents are exempted from the labor fee.
If Sichuan is required, public security police stations or commissioned community service agencies should strictly implement the approved fees and charges, and strictly prohibit over-the-scope, super-standard fees or bus charges.
On July 27, 2016, Chenyangxia, former secretary of Dingnan County Committee, Jinzhou City, came to work to report to the provincial commission, and served as the director of the party's wind and political supervision room (sub-officer, trial period of one year).
The red wine used for the night was provided by a friend of Li, and the other costs are borne by a person of Liu.
The CPC Central Committee of Jiangxi Province reported that Chen Yangxia, Cheng Liong and others in the private club organized and accepted to eat, violated the spirit of the eight provisions of the central party, and violated the discipline of the party.
The Bogba season last season ate two yellow cards in the Italian Cup, and a game will be automatically banned by the rules.
Although he has transferred back to Premier League, the Premier League has all been postponed to Premier League.
In this way, in the 14th of August, in the race against Bournemouth, Bogeba will be on the wall, and his return to Manchester will be postponed to the 20th home game with Southampton.
As the first round 12 pick in 2014, Sarlic will officially land in the NBA in the next season and join the Philadelphia 76 team.
As a young European player, many fans are not very familiar with him, but through this Olympic Games, I believe that Sarri's performance has left a great impression on people.
Last time, in a race in Croatia to win Spain, Sardinia successfully blocked Paul-Gassol's attempt to drag the game into the basket when he was added.
Recently, the 76-member team leader, Brett-Brown, gave a high rating to Sardegna, the spearhead, who thought he saw the shadow of the young Manu-Ginobili in Sardegna.
It is clear that Sarlic has shown his talent and has given 76 people a lot of expectations for him.
Croatia won 24 points, 17 baskets and 12 assists in the first two games at the Olympics.
In the first half, Sardeth demonstrated his ability to pull out the space on the scene, and, after dismantling his teammates, he was able to hit the basket outside the three-point line.
Although the 76-person inline is now full of talented young players, they are not equipped with Sarrich's foreign capabilities.
From caps to launchers to launchers to speed up and complete assists, today's NBA stadiums can do this in an in-line player ranking.
Since the beginning of this Olympic Games, Sarge has won 13 points, 8 baskets and 5 assists in three games, and has performed comprehensively.
Since the decision to return to the Knights in the summer of 2014, James has signed two 1+1 contracts.
With the current NBA wage agreement coming to the end of the year, as the vice president of the NBA Ball Staff Association, James will be at the forefront of the wage agreement negotiations.
Thanks to a significant increase in affiliate revenue, this is thanks to the new TV broadcasting protocol and the efforts of the bosses and players on how to deal with the money, and the outside world is worried that the NBA will be stuck in the fall next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about becoming a free player next summer, as he has contracted a three-year contract with the Knights.
Regardless of when the 2017-18 season is officially started, James is in the contract.
Since the amazing debut of iPhone SE, the mobile phone market has also welcomed the boom of small screens.
Recently, Nubia has also launched its first Z11 series: the Nubia Z11mini.
NubiaZ11mini continues its remarkable photo gene, equipped with a 5.0-inch screen that is easier to hold in one hand, easy to use back-finger identification, resulting in its outstanding user experience.
Nubia has just launched a small screen to take photos of the mobile phone Z11mini reduced the price of 200 yuan, that is, from the original $1499 yuan to $1299 yuan.
On the outside, the NubiaZ11mini uses a 5" 1080P screen, which is still the classic "small red circle" design at the bottom of the front.
The medium frame is metal material, and the bottom is symmetrically designed and configured with the Type-C data interface.
The future of the Portland Fertilizer Plant is uncertain due to the cancellation of the power supply contract
Since the power company for the plant has revealed that the owner of a plant will terminate a supply contract, which will cause all supply contracts to fail, the Portland aluminum fermentation plant and hundreds of workers in the plant are facing uncertain future.
This initiative will continue after the Victorian government has decided not to issue subsidies to ensure the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
More than 2000 workers in the U.S. aluminum company's Portland plant are likely to face unemployment.
Once the factory is closed, up to 2000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed.
And since the power consumption of the plant accounts for about 10% of all electricity output in Victoria, a chain reaction may also occur.
In 2014, the company closed the Honry Corner smelting plant, which resulted in the closure of the Angers Island power plant last year.
The aluminum company Portland refrigeration plant is currently losing and is facing a close-up risk.
The move was made after forecasting the factory in the coming years, originally due to the strength of the Australian dollar, and recently due to the price of the factory products.
AGL provides power to this large aluminium melting plant through the old Eggen power plant in the Rattleb Valley. The company predicts that the other three plant owners will also terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder of the plant is a joint venture between U.S. aluminum and aluminium oxide companies, while China's CITIC Group and Japan's Maruhong Co., Ltd. also holds a small number of shares.
The joint venture said: "AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the slurry plant will continue to produce electricity demand."
AGL said these contracts were "triggering contracts" that were supposed to come into effect from November 2016.
The contract expires for 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
"As a result, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in FY 2017," the power company said.
Any revenue impact on AGL since FY 2018 has now been subject to an optimistic outlook on wholesale power prices in the futures market.
AGL said the company has reduced the contract value of $187 billion in the "Termination of the activity is expected".
The company said the decision to terminate these contracts "will not affect the company's ability to run the melting plant or guarantee the power supply of the melting plant."
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with the old Egren in 2010, which was supposed to take effect in November this year, but the company did not explain why it quit.
Analysts will be cautious about whether the Portland smelters in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will be shut down due to a bad economic situation in the industry.
In an analyst's comments earlier this week, Steve Mickerson, AGL's chief operating officer, said Portland's annual electricity consumption reached about 600 MW and the Tomago plant reached about 900 MW.
If the two factories are closed, the demand for electricity market will be greatly reduced.
"As a power company, this is not a good news for us," he said.
The Community Legal Center rejects 16 million people each year.
Each year, more than 16 million weakest groups are rejected by the Community Legal Center. The capital of this service has been captured, and it is now facing further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people were rejected when they sought free legal advice and agency services, most of which were elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violent incidents, and those who had no resources to fight injustice.
The lack of community legal services has already exceeded the limits and is now facing further funding cuts.
From June next year, the federal government will reduce its funding for these legal centers by another 30%.
James Farall, head of the Queensland Community Law Center, said there were thousands of people rejected each year, according to the latest report from the National Community Law Center.
Mr. Farrel said that if the federal government does not change the existing decision, it will only get worse.
"The Queensland Community Legal Center has been underfunded for a long time, which means thousands of people will not be able to access the vital services they need," he said.
People who need to stay away from violent people, bear huge debts that can't be reimbursed, face disparate families, and oppressed workers who face legal issues, and the report shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut its funding by another 30% from June 2017, which means that there will be thousands of vulnerable communities in Queensland who will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Secretary of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately withdraw these money-saving decisions so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise the legal aid funding to the national average.
Now it is important to pay attention to the needs of the community and to the needs of the community, and the government must be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team has been prosecuted for shooting staff
New York: Trump's running team has been prosecuted for not being able to pick up a gimp while driving in February for North California Asia.
The former software trainer, Vincent Bodini, described the incident in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said before he hoped that the matter could be resolved internally, but waited a few months later he realized that "this is not possible."
According to Bodini's description, the head of the man named El Phillips "Put out a gun, put his right hand on the plate, and put the gun on the knee bone of the crippled Vincent."
After complaining to the local and regional election team leadership, Bodini learned that at least four people have experienced the same thing in the volume.
Bordini said in a complaint, "No gun will cause damage."
Just two days before the case took place, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the masses that if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and selected her favorite judge, "the person who supports the second amendment," that is, the gun support and gun enthusiasts may take action, the speech sparked anger.
Trump's campaign team said that the media did not take his word for it, and he did not advocate violence.
In the complaint, Bodini asked the running team to pay compensation for their own negligence and also required Phillip to pay compensation for his own attacks, strikes, and mental injuries.
Trump Spokesperson Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to this message.
We couldn't connect to Philip.
According to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip has recently left the running team.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services is not responding to incoming calls immediately.
The presidential candidate for the Republican party, Donald Trump, was controversial.
Both parties are the general court of the Superior Court of Macclemburg County (Charlotte), 16-CS-14300.
The United Kingdom must convey the spirit of the Olympics and expand on the Heathrow airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, to London and to the rest of the world.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, just as we did in the 2012 London Olympics to ensure that our country and region can benefit from these events.
The Olympics benefitted Stratford and the East.
And we will benefit the region again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local community only, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and leave young people around the airport unemployed.
Like before the 2012 London Olympics, some thought that the expansion of Heathrow was too large.
I was told that the United Kingdom will not be able to prepare for the Olympics and we will face off the world.
The suspects' doubts about the 2012 Olympics are wrong and their doubts about the Heathrow project will also prove to be wrong.
Although there are obstacles that need to be overcome, Heathrow is solving every problem we face.
As with the Olympics, Heathrow is a infrastructure project for most people, not just a few.
The expansion project will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bring about an economic growth of £21 billion, leaving a technological and employment wealth in the UK and around the airport.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team. The team has been on time and has completed a infrastructure investment project of £1 billion within the budget, including the T5 Terminal Building, which was selected as the best airport terminal building in the world for five consecutive years and the T2 Terminal Building between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to build a third runway with a private investment of £1.6 billion.
The United Kingdom has successfully held the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe the expansion of the Heathrow airport will be a huge success.
Now is a great time for us to spread the spirit of Olympic and expand the Heathrow Airport so that we can protect our future and create a technology and employment wealth that makes the UK proud.
President Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow Airport and former Business Advisor of the British Ministry of Finance.
A woman commits suicide on the Swiss Highway and dies
The victim was lying on the highway at night.
The woman attempted to commit suicide on Thursday morning and was assaulted on the highway. The police are currently looking for eyewitnesses.
The incident took place on the A1 highway near Vaughan Morday on Thursday morning.
A woman lying on the road late at night "desperately" and being bullied by a number of cars, WO State police said.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman whose behavior was clearly suicidal. She was overburdened by multiple vehicles, including a truck.
The woman died at the scene.
Police have revealed that multiple drivers have been investigated, but some drivers have not yet confirmed. The police are now calling on them and their attackers to investigate.
Mr. Gilles Hofstede told the Geneva Journal that criminal investigations are now underway, a routine process for such incidents.
However, it is not yet known whether the driver will face the charges.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
"This will be determined by the prosecutor," said Hofstede.
According to two other similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be held responsible.
The two cases, according to the report, were caused by a person walking on the highway late at night. The final verdict was that the driver was not expected to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with the death of a man due to negligence, which was in August 2014 when she hit a man and died on the A1 highway near Payyone.
The court said the 22-year-old victim passed the road after drinking alcohol.
The judge said after the investigation that the woman police were driving at the time was completely legal, and the man appeared on the road "absolutely unexpected and unpredictable," and the woman police sent a first aid call after the incident.
Anyone who provides information about the incident near Thursday Morse should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been suitable for human residence
According to NASA's forecast for the new climate model, Venus has been suitable for human residence.
Scientists at NASA Goddard Space Institute have developed a model that explores the past of Venus, which uses tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether or not Venus with a high surface temperature, waterless and atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide has had a similar environment to the Earth.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus' rotation speed was slower because of its atmospheric layer.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thinner atmosphere similar to the Earth's atmosphere and at that time the spin speed was just as slow.
This model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than the Earth, but there has been enough water and geological changes to nurture life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the brightness of sunlight irradiated on Venus was 30% darker than on Earth.
"In the model simulation of the Goddard Space Institute, Venus' slow spin makes it one side of the daytime time for nearly two months," Goddard Space Institute scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press conference.
This makes the surface warm and produces rainwater that can form thick clouds, and thick clouds are like a sponge that blocks the heat of most of the sun on the ground.
The simulated result is that Venus' average climate temperature is actually several times lower than the current Earth.
The evolution of Venus simulated in this model is similar to that of previous planetary scientists.
Despite the possibility of life on Venus, in billions of years, Venus is exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet light.
The ocean evaporates on the planet, and the water vapor is also burned out by the ultraviolet rays.
With the escape of hydrogen, only the thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and the deadly greenhouse gas effect left behind, thus forming the Venus we know today.
Researchers published the simulation results of the new Venus Climate Model in the Journal of Geophysical Research.
Patrick Roy resigned as head of the Snow Crash team
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as the lead coach and vice president of the Colorado avalanche rugby team, stating that he had no say in the decision-making level of the team.
Colorado Executive Vice President Joe Sachs confirmed the news and said the club is going to start looking for new master trainers right away.
"In the past three years, I have been driven by energy, passion and determination to fulfill the responsibilities of the Principal Trainer and Vice President of the Colorado Avalanche," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I've been thinking all summer about how to improve the team so that it has the power to take it to the next level.
The objectives of this coach and vice president must be consistent with the goals of the club.
He must also have the right to speak in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
However, these conditions are not yet met.
On May 23, 2013, Sachs hired Roy, and he thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today."
We would like to thank him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will be successful in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach of the Jack Adams Award League during the first season of the 2013-14 Playoffs.
He helped the club score 112 points, ranked first in the middle. However, the Colorado team was eliminated by the Minnesota team in the first round of the season, and in the last two years, they both lost their arm.
In the 2015-16 season, the Avalanche achieved 39 wins and 39 flat 4 runs, and eventually lost its second card qualification in the Western Grand Union region on a 5-point difference.
As a Hall of Famekeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups, each of which was awarded two when worked for the Canadians in Montreal and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Field Workers Stop Deforestation and Continue Negotiation
The chief negotiator said the workers in the North Sea Oilfield stopped working on their salaries, and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, a oil field service company, has appeared on the North Sea oil platform operated by the Royal Dutch Merchants.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of current disputes."
We will hold a number of full-day meetings in the coming weeks to re-examine these issues.
The trade union said its recent actions were to protest a possible reduction of up to 30%, which was the first time the trade union has taken since 25 years.
Wood Group lowers its North Sea contractor's salary by around 9% this year due to market pressure.
Prior to this reduction, the company reduced the company's offshore contractor's salary by 10% in 2014.
The company said that rebalancing will help companies to overcome the challenges of market depression.
The deck has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down the oil and gas equipment in 10 countries, which is because the company needs to streamline its business after the merger with the British Energy Company British Gas Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from the decline in crude oil prices and the Brexit decision in June.
Earlier this week, members of the Scottish Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders to discuss the largest labour conflict in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is important for the region.
Dave said in a statement: "In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need a economy that serves most people rather than a few."
In 2016, the project was expected to spend no more than $14 billion, while the average project spend over the past five years reached about $7 billion.
Kepler to measure the speed of the self-rotation of the star of Anjujutsu
The latest mission of the Capelle Space Telescope helps astronomers to collect the most complete self-rotation speed of the Ngong Ping galaxy.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the planets have different self-reflection speeds and how the self-reflection cycle is linked to the planet.
"We want to learn more about the relationship between star quality, age, and even its solar system history by comparing our results with other galaxies," said Luca Rebel, a research scientist at the California Institute of Infrared Treatment and Analysis at the press conference.
The Ancestral Planet is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the galaxy were born about 125 million years ago and have just reached adulthood.
They reached the highest speed of life.
When reaching the maximum self-rotation speed, these mature stars fire a large number of stars.
When these star winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they will have a braking effect on the stars.
As the age of the stars increases, its self-rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the self-rotation speed of each star by tracking the time that a recognizable star blackish (like the Sun) appears.
The latest self-rotating speed dataset shows that the self-rotating speed of larger stars is slower than the quality of smaller stars.
Rebel compares stars to dancers, and larger dancers rotate faster than smaller dancers.
"In the 'Ballet Performance' of the Ngong Ping Star Group, we find that stars with slower spins tend to be of higher quality, while those with the fastest spins tend to be the lightest."
Since the Ancestral is closer, it can be used as the ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the quality and rotation speed of stars.
Rebel said: "Ngongjujuo laid the foundation for the model of two-way rotation theory for young and young stars."
There is still a lot of knowledge we need to know about how, when and why the stars are slowing down and "get their shoes off".
Reubl and her colleagues in three new papers detail their latest analysis of the speed of self-rotation of the NJU galaxy. These three papers will soon be published in the journal Astronomy.
Mr. Zheng Jianjun, Director of Water Management at Nanhu Park, introduced that the depth of the water under the Nanhu is more than 10 meters, and those who do not understand the situation of the water, may be at risk.
'Although it is very professional, it is still hoped that large boating tourists can wear life jackets, do not do any illegal activities on the lake, and play safely,' said Zhengjianjun.
The surrounding village has a unique marine environment, with two natural ecological and human ecological leisure tourism resources.
"But the individual owner who bought the parked car park, afraid that doing so will affect the price of their own parking space, and also suspect that other people have a private, so it has been damaged behind the back, leading to a car park remodeling thing was put in place."
The question of when and how many people came up with this question is still quite common in the academic community.
At present, the introduction of potatoes is mainly three lines.
The biggest and most widely spread of the three lines introduced by the sweet potato is the introduction of Chen Zhenlong from the Philippines to Fuzhou.
From now on, the Beijing Municipal Administration of Social Groups will conduct a special inspection on the use of the uniform receipts of social groups.
The examination is divided into two groups: self-examination and self-examination.
The scope of this inspection includes the 2013 to 2015 in the municipal social organizations to collect the uniform receipts of social groups.
In the 2012 Olympic Communication Strategy, the Organizing Committee of Rio de Janeiro has said, "The Olympics have been successfully defined by people who share their stories on social media."
And from the report of this Olympic Games, the media in the transmission mode, product form, language style, news perspective and other aspects have made a big change in the past.
The International Olympic Committee and media workers from all over the world seem to have taken on this challenge.
On August 11, Everbright Securities H-shares public sales entered the last day. There was news that the first two days of the market reaction was flat. In accordance with the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
A domestic securities analyst said that Oriental Securities in Hong Kong base is not good, its asset management business is the long East Securities. Compared with BOC International, CITIC Securities and other banks, it seems congenial.
Experts pointed out that this year, with the return of the securities market, many securities business performance has declined, but the company after the listing of the situation to pay more attention to the development of the company's own business, can not be summarized.
After the new administration, Suzhou will become the nation's first second-tier city to re-open limited purchases.
The second-tier cities that are planning to introduce or are about to introduce the control policy of Taida City are more than Suzhou, but also include Hefei, Nanjing and other cities.
Previously, Hefei has been the first to release a limited loan policy, for two suites under the name Hefei and a set of housing loans unfinished buyers, the bank will refuse to provide mortgage services.
