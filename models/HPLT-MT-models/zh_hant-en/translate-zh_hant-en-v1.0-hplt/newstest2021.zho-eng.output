Xinzhen News Agency, Xinjiang, July 26th electricity problem: Xinjiang to deeply cultivate "To the Sunflower fields" to use good clean energy
6000 more than a block five-shaped set sun, each set 48 square meters, a circle arrange the whole can, such as a yellow color "To the Sunflower fields", with the sun moving, the sun reflected to the center of the heat tower of more than 200 meters high, to realize the power generation.
On 25th in the middle-electric project in Ishigami Lake, Xinjiang, the people of the 25th came to see this scene in a melting tower light-heating power station.
"The melting tower light generation, is the reflection of the sun through the surface to the absorbing tower formation of heat, and then through traditional power generation technology to transform the thermal energy into electricity."
The design principle is similar to the solar power used in rural villages in the northwest of China, and the sun needs to be gathered.
The power plant was built in October 2017, achieved the network by the end of last year, accounting for 6600 million, and a total plan to install 14500 fixtures.
“Compared to traditional solar power generation technology, its maximum advantage is that it can store the heat gathered, and can also be generated at night.”
The project's configuration of the 13-hour thermal system, which allows the generator to maintain a stable operation, not affected by light changes; can also according to the demand of the wind peak, quickly participate in the power peak.
The project is completely built, can achieve 1.98 degrees of annual power generation, can save about 6,000 coal per year more than 60 sulfur dioxide, more than 60 nitrogen oxides, more than 20 vaping, more than 15 million carbon dioxide, provide local clean energy.
In addition, there is another silver "to the Sunflower fields" in the stone city of Hami, the photovoltaic industry park.
With more than 2300 solar power plants, the 714 power generation equipment that has been built together with the solar drive, it has always maintained the sun and the cluster panel into a right angle of 90 degrees.
"We use the collagen tracking copolymer power generation technology, through a unified integration control, all power generation equipment will be adjusted according to the height of the angle of the sun, to maintain power generation efficiency."
The long segment of the power station, in the light of the weather conditions, the power generation technology traditional photovoltaic power generation efficiency can be increased by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than 700 million power generation, complementing local electricity needs.
Ishimoto Photovoltaic Industry Park is the largest single size in Xinjiang, Photovoltaic component type the most complete photovoltaic industrial demonstration park area, a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, total assembly units 82 kW.
In the first half of this year, the power generation volume exceeded 1.1 magnitude, an increase of 6% by the same period in 2019.
Hamilton is one of the best conditions for China's solar energy resources.
The average annual solar overall laser amount is more than 6200 mega focal length per square meter, and the sunshine time is about 3200 hours per year.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry, a good "to Sunflower fields".
The solar power generation of more than 250 kilowatts has been built, this year's first half of the city's photovoltaic power generation volume is more than 14 degrees Celsius, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
Currently, more than 330 power stations in Xinjiang, installed with a capacity of more than 10 million kW.
Photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 150 degrees per year, which can be replaced by more than 600 million coal.

American media uncovers the truth that the United States calls for China to shut down the Houston General Building
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the U.S. Powerhouse of the United States, the Chinese government decided to revoke the establishment and operation of the license for the U.S. General Assembly of Chengdu, and the General Affairs Office to stop all business and activities of the specific requirements, as the U.S. abrupt 21-day call for the central government to shut down the central central building of Houston.
The U.S. government's line of attention, whose political motivation has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is the Central Government closed?
Several foreign media say it is not clear why the United States will choose the headquarters of the Chinese Republic of Houston, but for the purpose of this drive, the foreign media speaks unequivocally: for the general election.
The U.S. demanded a call from the U.S. to shut down the Houston General Building to raise concerns about its political motives, according to a 23-day report by the U.S. Cable TV Network (CNN).
The article says that the U.S. government’s response to the pre-election of President Trump’s popular support rate was sluggish in response to the pre-pandemic pandemic.
The White House officials said privately that China's tough strategy to take in order to save Trump's support rate, but also in order to transfer the White House epidemic to cope with the failure of responsibility.
The article believes that the headquarters of the Chinese Republic of Houston is a "politically driven, very discreet" target selected by the United States, the United States government has chosen it "to create a strong degree of purity while avoiding the dangers of major conflicts."
The British Broadcasting Company (BBC) also believes that in the U.S. election season, the U.S. economy has been heavily beaten by the epidemic, Trump believes that "to play 'Chinese brand' has a political advantage."
The current situation is 'a spiral rise, the relative egg', which is to some extent driven by the U.S. government from the domestic point of view, will only make the relationship between the U.S. and China more oriented.
The Colombian Broadcasting Corporation (CBS) reported that Trump’s discretionary outlook was under pressure due to the outbreak, and he repeatedly cited China as a result of the pandemic.
There are almost every day new actions against Trump’s “China Cutting America” absurd discussion.
“The Houston General Building is very important when it comes to establishing connections between the two countries”
The U.S. asked the headquarters of Houston to add to the relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
In addition to diplomacy, U.S. citizens who are located in the south of the U.S. are struggling to obtain assistance, and U.S. citizens who seek visas and other services are also struggling.
A Houston business community expressed a regret to the U.S. that the headquarters of Houston has played an important role in establishing connections between trade, investment and culture in both countries.
The American Society believes that this reflects the importance of China’s economy.
U.S. Foreign Policy magazine, the United States of America's drive "is part of a series of provocative measures that will only bring the U.S.-China relationship to the modernization".
Reuters quoted Jonathan Polak, an expert on East Asian issues at the American think tank Brookings, who has since established a comprehensive diplomatic relationship between the United States and China in 1979, and did not think of any momentum compared to the action of the U.S. to the headquarters of the U.S. in Houston, China.
The South China Morning Post reported that the United States is driving more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the United States and China.
Analysts believe that this may cause persistent damage.
Founded in 1979, the headquarters of the Chinese Republic of Houston is the first of its kind in the United States.
Currently, China has a embassies and five headquarters in the United States.

State Council experts and autonomous regions, Urumqi city experts are making further assessment of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Information Office held a press release on 26th to inform about the epidemic situation and prevention and control situation in Xinjiang.
According to him, 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 (including 5 confirmed cases of asymptomatic infections) were added to Urumqi City from 0 to 24 July, and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infections were added.
As of July 25, there are 135 confirmed cases of Urumqi City, 147 cases of asymptomatic infection.
25 days of the new asymptomatic infections are basically through the city's free nucleic acid detection, active detection.
The majority of Urumqi’s free nucleic acid testing work has been basically completed, according to the 26th day of the director of Urumqi City Health Committee.
He also said that from the experience of the rest of the country, there are many factors that affect the results of the nucleic acid detection, such as testing sensitivity, infection time and detoxification of the inspector, when the specimen was picked up by the inspector to cooperate with the situation (match may cause the specimen is not in place) as well as the detection environment, the degree of operational practice of the inspector, etc.
Due to various reasons, nucleic acid tests will also show false results.
The false nature of the prosthesis is that the tested person is indeed an infected person, but the results of the nucleic acid test are inherent.
In addition, for confirmed cases, suspected cases have been closely connected personnel, it usually takes two nucleic acid tests to be excluded.
For people in the high-risk areas of the past epidemic, if there is fever and respiratory symptoms, a nucleic acid test for the presence of a false nature of the possibility, so two nucleic acid tests are also required to be excluded.

Experts discuss using the U.S. Census to collect immigration information for hospital seat allocation
Several civil rights groups and several American cities and authorities have made claims to the federal government that Trump’s presidential state attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census from being unacceptable, but also in a safe manner.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. Capitol.
The United States Civil Rights League enforces the Voice of the United States of Attorneys Sala Brann, "That does not work."
She followed, and said, Trump asked to do so in the census to determine the citizenship of the census’s people, and “not very reliable.”
Another civil liberties organization of the Co-Organization has proposed a discussion on Thursday and challenged Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey, Georgia have joined the conversation.
Arlington County, Virginia on Friday also added a comment.
“The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate breakdown of our population every 10 years,” said Gary, Chairman of the Board of Management at Arlington. “We must accurately clear that everyone who lives in Arlington can’t make this illegal trial run and the number of people who run our migration community.”
Another executive order for some organizations and individuals to hold President Trump.
Marshall, Attorney General of Alabama, said the executive order is a “favourable” of the state.
He said, “When assigning a state’s congressional seat and a qualifying seat, it must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of residents legally resident.”
The U.S. Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration from incorporating citizenship issues into the 2020 Census table last year.
President Trump earlier this week enacted an executive order to direct the U.S. Bureau of Census Business Minister Ross to submit data on the undocumented population from the census, so that the administration would exclude the undocumented population from the state’s census and determine whether each state would increase or maintain a seat as a member of the census.
The United States is reassigning its House seats every 10 years, based on demographic change.

The American White Question asks that states have resumed their work prematurely
On July 23, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, the President of the United States Trump repeatedly asked the states to repeat the school, until recently it changed the degree of change, take the initiative to wear masks in the public court, and his advisers were "anti-bread" that some states had resumed earlier.
On the 22nd, President of the White House asked Julian Conway at the press conference that some state governments did not comply with the rework standards, and had already replied places such as bars.
Conway also mentioned that the former president has a "right to object" decision to the state's resumption of work, is a statement.
“President is a federalist who believes that states have autonomy.”
She explained for Trump.
However, the word “proverbs” in the Cornwick mouth was spoken by Trump at the April 13 White House Newsletter.
The operation of this self-armed, by the people of the Internet, was remembered as "reformed history".
Julian Conviy wants to change the history, she is a quirk.
Trump called the governor of Michigan, Graham Whitmer, an indictor, because she followed the medical guidelines and stumbled on shutdowns.
Trump wants to push the resumption, so he can hold a meeting.
This was not the first time that Julian Conwy was brought up.
On April 15, Conway, when it was interviewed by Fox News, drew out: “This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!”

3 years old college game play was cut, after winning to talk to the school reasonable?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Siyon ResponsibilityEdit
The playground was smashed and the children were won and then addressed to the school
□ The Newspaper Newsletter
3 years old while playing at a university game, accidentally smashed the team's head while playing.
After a certain wrestling, Mr. Wen Xiaowen's father as the legal representative of the small text will be the school to the court, requiring the operation of the school to plead apology, and pay medical expenses, mental compensation and other co-existence of two yuan.
Recently, the Beijing Haidian People's Court of this case after the thought, when the school set up a protective network in the playground, has been deemed to be the appropriate security measures, and some has been carried out, according to this decision returned to the plaintiff's request.
Mr. Moon said that during the summer of 2019, he brought Xiaowen to play in the school playground, when the team was positively squaded in the playground training.
In order to avoid the dangers brought about, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents in the safe areas designated by the team.
But after that, the team members are playing certain players, causing the player to fly over the guard to the above-mentioned safe area and have followed the pen.
Mr. Wen immediately brought the novel to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed as a foreigner.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school court do not meet the relevant safety requirements, not the team and related facilities to effectively manage.
The loss of the school caused the above events, resulting in the small body and mind suffer huge pain, but also to its family bring great pain, this school should undertake legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school said that the school has set a protective network in the playground, and issued management rules, training notices, notified to enter the playground and training site to maintain a safe distance and remind the attention to their own safety, the plaintiff can not prove that the school 'not as good as security', so disagree.
After the court, the venue involved in the case of the University of the public free open space, the school to the management of the playground there is security obligations, but this security must only reach the general attention of the task.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective network in the playground, has come to the appropriate security services, and some of the previous plans have been achieved in accordance with the previous recommendations of medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses of more than two thousand yuan, both sides agreed to the one-time solution.
After the matter, the parents of Xiaowen once again ruled out the school, and in no way the court sentenced back to the plaintiff's entire petition.
After the trial, both parties have not heard, and the decision is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of the China's Infringement Liability Act provides that the school as the manager of public places, there is a duty of security; in the case of third party acts causing harm to others, the third party undertakes to infringe responsibility, and does not even go to public places of security should bear the corresponding responsibility.
The judge said that, as the manager of public places, it is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire venue, the dangers and hazards that may occur precipitate, and thus most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent loss of occurrence or the degree of damage, and to avoid and reduce the cost of occurrence, so the law stipulates by its commitment to social activities in the corresponding protection and obligations.
In this case, for the free public open playground is not a specific entry into the crowd, the school's safety and security obligations should be appropriate for the social activities it engages in, specifically, the main should be to take basic security measures and for the hidden dangers have to be informed of the obligation.
In the judicial practice, it is not suitable for public sector managers to have a high degree of security.
If the school has taken measures to set up a protective network and if it comes to inform the task, it can be determined that the school does not have a missing, should not undertake legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the school and other public places managers are not as safe and secure as possible, its responsibility is also as a victim of harm, according to the most up-to-date content of the Civil Code, the administrator undertakes to accept responsibility, can also be traced to the third party.
Therefore, in this kind of accident, the victim should no longer be enlarged after receiving the direct infringer's shyness.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for exercise and fitness is high.
With the gradual opening up of the inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is coming to replenish.

More than 3 million cases of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Japan - Xinhua Net
According to statistics, 26 new confirmed cases of 239 cases in Tokyo, the cumulative total of 11214 cases has been added to the 6-day new cases.
In addition, the Osaka Prefecture added 141 confirmed cases, and the Fukuoka added 90 new cases, and the Aichi Prefectural University added 80 new cases.
The first half of telecom network calls crime rises by 70 percent
According to the highest website news, in the first half of this year, the national surveillance authorities jointly reported a criminal offense of 58101 people, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
In particular, it is a crime that interferes with the prevention and control of the epidemic, and examines the number of alleged criminals accounted for 43.4% of the total number of crimes that interfere with the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Inspection Institute has carried out guidance on sex, currently released in ten typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control, involving nine charges.
From the first half of the inspection of the situation, involving numerous names of criminal practice, up to the national macro policy, down to the old people's clothing and clothing, including epidemic-related claims, 'care', 'care', 'healthcare', 'intermediation agency' practice, 'crudential intervention', 'crutiny' practice, 'crutiny' practice, 'crudential treatment' practice, 'crudential treatment' practice, 'crudential treatment' practice, 'crudent settlement of national claims, national assets, and so on, uninterrupted 'exploitation of new', the scope of education, medical treatment, employment, old age, social security, property clearance, financial credit and other areas, not only caused by the victim of economic losses, but also seriously affected the development of society.
In particular, some telecommunications networks to break through the restrictions of national boundaries, geographical and personnel, with cross-border, remote, electronic payment and other characteristics, not specific groups of victims, harm greatly.
If, some of the establishment of specialized companies, rental of high-quality fonts, set up multiple departments or positions, the use of legal network platform publicity, recruitment, training and assessment of recruiters, the use of business model management, 'legal coat', more confusing.
In accordance with law to deter and prevent crime, timely to the public and relevant departments to issue a warning, is an urgent organ must not be embarrassed.
In judicial cases, prosecutors are serious to fulfill their duties, both adhering to the practice of crime to maintain a high degree of pressure, but also targeted to refine the various measures of law and measures, through scrutiny recommendations and other measures to promote social governance.
Inspection agencies to approve, start the case facts, evidence, procedures and applicable law, based on facts, to the law as the basis of law, do not be obsessed.
In particular, for telecommunications networks to criminalize, pay attention to the core role of electronic data in facts and affirmations, and strive to build a certificate of authenticity between electronic data, dialects and certificates.
Such as the investigation of the investigation of the Zhejiang province, Ningbo district should be a case involving the epidemic, the first time to intervene in advance, from the occurrence of the case to the completion, only 5 days, reflecting from the soon to deal with, maintenance of the overall situation of the stability and determination.
In the censorship arrest and review of the circumstances, pay attention to the case of the leak offenders chase work, the public security authorities to seize 733 people, the public security authorities to censor the critics of the same crime of 1113.
In the first half of the year, the National Inspection Institute of the People's Republic of China issued test suggestions 298 pieces of crime, to promote hands-on prevention of crime together, to promote deep governance.
For example, the communication companies, banks, intermediaries found in the case of telecommunications network monitoring loopholes, Guangzhou Municipal Inspection Institute, Dongguan Municipal Inspection Institute of Guangdong Province, timely suggestions for inspection, urging units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and help promote long-term effectiveness system construction.
Fourth, we do our best to chase up losses.
Inspection agencies around the world to seize the intervention of the search lead verification, review and other important aspects, urge the inspection authorities to follow up the financial recovery, cooperate with the relevant departments to do a good job of tracking the work, and strive to criminalize the cause of economic losses caused by the people to minimize.
If the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Investigation of a roadside case, the case involves 22 suites of property pending lockdown, in the case where the property may be pre-arranged by other cases, the first to create a "wivel execution letter", promptly sent to the relevant court, suggesting that the previous lockdown court on the property related to the implementation of the insolvency of the case, pending the criminal facts identified the unified disposal, in order to repatriate the property involved, to repatriate the victim lost to make the best efforts.
Inspectors remind you that there must be a high degree of vigilance against paralyzed crime, do not expect 'flying off in the sky', do not think cheap, believe in, keep their 'legged pouches'.

Cool heat, Economic Times - Chinese economy netkeepers enter the village of Yunnan, the province of Yunnan, China.
On the day of the sun, the villager Li Yuanzhong in the base of the lay of the grass, suddenly pondered, but when the mouth sang several small songs from time to time.
The mine, due to the low degree of fluency, high altitude, sufficient light, poor night temperature, high sugar content, good taste, in the surrounding area has a certain awareness, but also because of the small, spots, has not been able to sell a good price, can not form the industrial scale.
Twenty-one town was a 'bag valley oceanf spring autumn' of the troubled town, 10 years ago the local troubled incidence of up to 25.8%.
In the key period of attack into the decision-making, the transformation of traditional planting, adjusting industrial structure, increasing farmers' income is imminent.
After a number of visits, I think that industrial development can no longer go the old road.
For this reason, the town has led to the introduction of companies, in a modern way to grow fruit.
Wion Beyond Agricultural Co., Ltd. Vice General Manager Hu Jianwen 2015 from Shaanxi to Shaanyu research, at a glance local planting conditions, from 2016 to local seed planting.
Initially, the villager Li Yuanzhong brought out the land to become a seed of fruit and vegetables, Li Yuan Zhongfu and his heart made a whistleblowing: "So the years of fruit, but also did not see the village who found the fruit of the species." 」
“All kinds of fruit are dwarfed fruit that does not allow the fruit to grow too high.”
Let Li Yuan Zhong did not think that this fruit planting new methods, irrigation water pipes to every seed plant, water and fertilizers to the root, the autumn harvest, the tractor directly into the fruit garden, the station can be removed fruit.
At present, the fruit base has gradually entered the period of probation, the market is also as the pre-precipitation of Hu Jianwen, the fruit is not consolated, is loved by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities consumers.
The growing fruit industry, so that the life of Li Yuanzhong has a new change, still in the land, but the income has a new source.
Li Yuanzhong family with 9 more land flowing to the fruit base, each year in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, the fruit is also conducive to the division of redness, husband and wife usually work in the base, "one person can get 80 yuan a day, a living dry each year."
Li Yuan counselor, last year profit margin was scored by 2800 diversification, plus land transfer fees and married labor income, a income of 8 million diversified, 'Eat unsatisfactory, the day of well-being has been passed.'
"Currently effective, the annual output of 1 fig is more than 1.5 million yuan, about 10 times of corn."
Verdictors, the entire town is currently 2 million fruit, only in the middle of the village has 6000, covering 4056 accounts, 1.72 million, including the construction of the card account 656 accounts, 2952 people, the annual salary of more than 600 million, the real base built at the home door, working without going out.
Li Yuan Zhong from the waist bag to drum began to realize his "heart".
This year, the spring season, Li Yuan loyal to buy a cross-country, such as today opened a car to work, 'the family also has ten years of land, such as the next fruit base expansion scale, all the flow to them, the income more. '

Film separation technology to help crack the "green room effect"
New hybrid base film preparation technology demonstration
Reporter Rui Daily, Tianjin University Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy team on 'film separation law capture carbon dioxide' made a major progress, successfully developed new hybrid base film system technology, greatly improve the performance of film material carbon dioxide capture.
Relevant results have been published as the cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
"Greenhouse effect" is a major problem of human development, carbon dioxide emissions is caused by the "greenhouse effect" lazy.
How efficient capture and use of human emissions of carbon dioxide is the focus of scientists concerned.
"Film Separation Law" is a new apex of CO2 capture technology, it helps with film material separation of CO2 gas, has efficient energy saving, simple operation characteristics.
How to make the film material "deep breath" to improve the gas separation efficiency, is the use of film separation method to capture the calcium point of carbon dioxide.
Tianjin University scientific research team innovative ideas, through repeated experiments, explore the different dissolved gas separation performance impact.
The results of the experiment showed that N-methylamicotone as a preparation for solvent, resulting in more uniform distribution of carbon nanotubes in the film material, "more breathable", effectively improve the performance and rate of membrane material gas separation.
With this new technology, the CO2 separation performance is close to the theoretical separation limit of this film material.
“The new technology provides a new idea for film separation to capture CO2.”
Li Fang, a member of Tianjin University’s Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy team, said: “We hope this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises to handle liquefied gases, in the control of greenhouse gas emissions and other major effects.”
Before you fill in the report, get to understand that it is a professional level difference - CNS
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source:Chenchen Morning Post Author:Chen Hsu Environmental responsibilityEdit
Before you fill in the report, get to know the professional level is the difference
Every year, students or parents do not understand the name involved in the report, and thus affect the report.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing Zhaoding University, Beijing Linyi University, Beijing Chemical University 5 universities jointly issued the admissions policy in 2020, to cancel the professional level poor.
What does the professional level difference mean and what is important in the report?
There are three ways professionally assigned rules
Expert reminder, before filling out the aspirations, be sure to read carefully the school's >, understand the university's admission rules, including proportions, professional allocation rules and so on.
Professional distribution rules, refers to the university after the restructuring, for professional access mainly specialized priority, score priority, professional level three ways.
Colleges and universities specific one way to use, will be clearly described in the Admissions Charter.
But there are some colleges and universities, admission principle is always priority, there is no level difference between the professional.
It is said that candidates will be admitted in the range in accordance with the total score, when the score did not reach the first professional volunteer score line, see whether it reached the second professional volunteer score line, such a push until the access to the last professional goal, the professional volunteers between the different professional volunteers do not set the level difference.
So 'professional grade difference' is the institution in the arrangement of the candidate's professional, according to the admissions charter published in one or several fractions, to determine the selection of different professional candidates admissions professional, this fraction is 'professional grade difference'.
What is the difference between the scores of the first professional volunteers and non-first professional volunteers in admission to the candidates? The differences between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 points, etc.
Example to say.
Assumption that students are enrolled in elementary school A, exam 560 points, its professional volunteers are divided into: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, A college professional admission to implement professional level difference method, level difference is 2 points, 1 score, 1 score, 0 points.
In professional distribution, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteers meet the requirements of professional access and professional planning, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" professional; if the computer has not been taken, his score will be removed by 2 points, by 558 score of the same first professional volunteers report the "International trade" candidate sorted to determine whether it meets the professional access conditions; if still unable to meet, the score will be removed 1 points (i.e. 557 points) for the third professional volunteer "automation" admission; if the dependent can not be satisfied, the score will then be removed 1 points (i.e. 556 points) for the fourth professional entry, the subsequent professional professionals if still can not meet their professional aspirations, will no longer be scored, so on.
Different professional level settings are different
With the popularity of parallel aspirations, now a lot of colleges and universities have canceled the professional level difference, but this year still some colleges and universities still retain this method, from the university published >, there are more than 20 colleges set professional level difference this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Zhongchuan University, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu College of Medicine, Dongbei Power University, Jiao Mei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Liaoxia University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these colleges, each university has a different level of professionalism.
Some colleges and universities have class differences in each professional, such as Liaoxia University, the case has been put into the school candidates, according to the candidate to fill in the order of the professional volunteers, in order to score by 1 score.
And some universities have different levels of difference between different professions.
For example, College of America, the total value of professional volunteers is 4 points, that is, the first professional volunteers and other professional volunteers are divided by 3 points, other professional volunteers do not set the level difference, as parallel aspirations, other professional volunteers and professional volunteers are divided by 1 points.
When filling in the report, candidates and parents must carefully read the school's admission policy, to see if there is no professional level difference in the form of class difference, in full consideration of the score, but also to rational analysis of the selected school and professional, if the institution in the admissions charter clearly take the way to access the score difference, candidates in the selection of professional, pay attention to the various professional between the gradients, improve the admission rate.
