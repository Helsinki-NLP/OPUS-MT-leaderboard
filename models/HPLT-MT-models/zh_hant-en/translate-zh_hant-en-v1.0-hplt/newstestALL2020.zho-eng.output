The course of the World Cup has been close to the end, and it is still waiting, but in the face of the Serbian squad, the Chinese women's row can not be lost.
The first two tournaments with the Netherlands, the performance of the Chinese women's row as always strong, respectively at 25:19, 25:16 first, two cities, until the third, the team encountered a set of frustrations.

The Republic has to risen to the 70th anniversary, and the spotlights of the various media are bright, so much of the image we don’t recall, glowing -- it’s exactly them, bringing the heat for our bright days, the pits that bring light to light...
However, if the hero walks around, it also appears that ordinary as you are like me.
Yuan Longping, heartfelt research, breeding the whole world, let ten people do not repeat the vulgar, strong, this bond is usually like an old citizen who likes the alien aliens in the field; Nan Rendong, good at all the chief scientist that makes China 'the sky 'angry' wrath, a person, a son, a mouth, a life only one thing, in the deep hills of the state of China, and the elders of the hentai, but also a young adult; Zhou Chang, the archeologist, a village child who is very late, to the old is still like a red, learn Chinese and Western, a stroke of white, with a life only one thing, to do, in the deep hillsqueeze, and the hensquen, who does not hesitate, but also have a great pleasure, to learn, to see, and then, love the hens, and hens, and hens.
They, ask for reincarnation, live life, singly, as long as they immersed in the foreign people who do not understand and their precious business, it is easy to live quickly, not in the name of Elisha, rich and luxurious.
Just like Jinhua Xiaoxi, the small forest of the Tibetan monastery, the shaking martial arts, inexorption and mercy.
Every “truth”, every one of the naked heart, behind one of my own country.
Not only on the shoulder of the hero, but also in the palm of the country.
Once, a female middle school student's speech, was converted by netizens, "When the hero passes, there must always be someone sitting in the road to applause ... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be someone sitting in the road to applause. ”
In fact, when the hero and the hero applause, it is not contradictory.
Those who are applauded by the road, but also in the heat and light, they are also glowing bodies.
Ordinary as you like me, there are always some opportunities in your life, there are some moments, there is a kind of tumult, but also to shape the model of the hero.
Shanghai's outstanding judge Yihua, shoulder justice reform responsibilities, in the annual meeting let Hada room master to talk their own story, a year, received countless newspapers and letters, from the no difference, "to do the simple things, is not simple ", Shao Biya rate judges will take charge of the delivery to this "throwning" style of old collection.
It's a shame between the heroes, and a hero is apprehended to another hero.
Jingjing has a small forest monastery, Yuan Longping has a lively rice plant field, Nan Rendong has a "Sky Eye", Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Rongchang has a quiet... Whether it can be a hero, do not rely solely on their own efforts, but also have a good environment and positive moisturizing mechanism.
For example, "China's eyes", now it seems that it is the word of God.
In the 90s, the Chinese science and technology industry was still climbing, and Xiaojiao Zhixin has not yet written "Trio".
At that time the most bullish "eyes", is the American Puerto Rico Island valley in the one-sided radio telescope -- Aresibo, up to 350 meters, considered to be the "never to rise" of the world.
At that time, Chinese radios were not as distant as one tenth of their families.
And in Japan, South Rendong, who enjoys world-class research conditions and salary, has taken back a near crazy idea: build a new generation of radio 'Great Outlook' in China, receive more messages from outer space!
What do you need to play for the stars?
The motherland trusts Nan Rendong, the "vision of the heavens" works awful end.
The address was used for 12 years, and the item was completed for 9 years.
The 500m mouth of the "Skyeyes" open, China is made without precedent to follow, "the world has a unique big scientific project".
So, “The eyes of the sky” are remarkable, and the people of the south are remarkable, and it is great to stand tall and beautiful in the country.
With the trust of the state, the good faith of the nationals, the South China East has a mechanism to become the liver of the soul of the people of the country.
There are young talents, white hair heroes have passed away, people in the way to continue to applaud, this kind of country, very beautiful and harmonious.

The Long Existence of Political Property
On 26th the local time, former French President Hilac descent, aged 86.
At the moment of the unprecedented change in the world for a hundred years, the French politician left a lot of political real estate when he moved to politics, which is still worth it.
Hilak has been appointed President of France for 12 years in a personal and attractive manner.
He has both inherited the spirit of independence and independence of the Caucasus, and has certainly supported the integration of Europe and is a representative figure in the pursuit of “European Dream”.
At the same time, he also vigorously advocates the diversity and diversity of the world, a politician with a strategic vision.
That’s why the French media rate him “a prominent representative of France on the world stage ”.
One of the political decisions of Shirak’s impressive tsujin lanes is the war against the U.S.-led Iraqi.
Under his lead, France drove Germany to hold the United States pressure and walk in the forefront of the anti-war.
One year after the war broke out, he predicted that the Iraqi war would lead to the addition of terrorist activities, making the world even more dangerous.
The subsequent fact proves that the warnings of Hilac are correct.
In the unity of Europe, as a result of the growing popularity of monopolisticism in the United States, the pursuit of today, Hilak for the strategic thinking and decision-making of international politics and global affairs, there is undoubtedly a strong indication.
Hilak is also a French politician who is familiar with the Chinese.
He is one of the advocates and creators of the Chinese legal relationship "Golden Decade", in 1995, the first choice of the president of France, the politicalist's strategic vision to promote the rapid development of the legal relationship.
In 2004, China Law established a comprehensive strategic partnership, Sino-French interaction into a new stage.
During the period of the Hilac politics, the Chinese-French governments trade increased rapidly, two countries in aviation, nuclear energy, rail transport and other areas of cooperation have made breakthrough progress.
Hilak’s Chinese-French Cultural Year has created a new cultural exchange model in the history of Chinese-French.
Shirak’s life is particularly impressive about Chinese culture.
According to his introduction to the Chinese diplomat, Hilak can back some of the myths of Libai and Dufu, and can even accurately judge the history of the Chinese moulder.
“Don’t see the pyramid actually going to Egypt, don’t see Midi really going to China ” -- this golden sentence comes from Hilak.
Hilak has been featured in the Xinhua activists’ report: “The political and social development of China in the West, the problems arising from the growth of China’s economy, and China’s international political status have been distracted.
But I am full of confidence in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is sufficient to help it establish the concept and concept of development, and to carry on its own responsibility on the world stage for a long time. ”
I believe that the restoration of China will bring new creativity to the world culture and rich the world culture.
The Sassi has gone, but the political fertilization and revelations that Hillak has left to the world will survive with the ages.

According to the European Times on 26th, the French Parliament will discuss the reform of immigration policy next week.
President Mark Kong recently claimed that France would not be able to “attach all”, but at the same time strive to “take it properly”.
According to the report, Mark went on to try to find a discount medium route on immigration affairs, and collapsed the upcoming debate.
Recently, Mark went on to participate in the United States in New York during the UN General Discussion, said that he hoped that there is a real 'challeng down' program in the immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
“If France wants to be able to accept (immigration) words properly, it cannot accept everyone,” Mark says.
The four key points of the immigration policy are: to protect the refugees as soon as possible, to promote immigration integration more efficiently, to receive and protect all immigrants entering the French territory, and to more effectively resettle people who are illegally entering France and who are not suitable to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance (AME) system is the most discussed topic before.
Mark describes that he wants to be able to "evaluate" the system, but does not cancel it, but makes some restrictions on it.
After the release of the speech, the right "National League" leader Leong said that the expression of the Mack's is "empty".

In the next General Election 2022, the issue of immigration policy questions will again become the focus of the right-wing attack, and Mark Jones needs to make a difference in this issue, but it will also risk the risk of angering the left-wing within the party.
According to reports, the lower courts of the French National Assembly will be on discussion of immigration policy from September 30, and the Senate will be on discussion from October 2nd.

During the corruption aspect, at the end of last year, Trudeau rolled into the 沸扬 of the 'Lan万灵 event' among.
It was exposed, on their own home building engineering company 'Lan Excel' a major private fraud case, to the authorities and officials of the checkpoint, the latter 'high earner'.
And, Trudeau was angry after things were too large to disclose the abuses of officials -- Wang Guandi, as mentioned earlier, was the first one to disclose the frauds, direct conduct of the cases of the Canadian General Inspector General.
Even though the case itself is suspicious, it is suspected to wash it.
Many observers pointed out that Trudeau's 5 years people set a collapse, mainly their own "crats" due to, and the largest "pit" is more than "the tiger tail" "self-eat its fruit" and "described to the law itself, the lawyers" these three.
According to data from Canada’s most authoritative Angus Red people, since 2015, support for Trudeau’s victims has slipped from more than 60% to more than 30%, and the opposition has risen from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Even though other opposition parties and their party members do not perform as well, even though a considerable part of the voters still cast a vote for the Federal Free Party, it is now no surprise that the Federal Prime Minister and the ruling party would have no idea.
On October 21, the new Canadian federal legislature is about to begin, and Trudeau can re-run the full-fledged show 5 years ago?
The answer may be in a word: terrible.
Whether it is competitive from the enterprise, the consumer experience, or from regional aviation integration, the development of the integration of the University of Beijing, there are profound impact and enthusiasm.
On September 25th, Beijing Dalian International Airport was officially opened.
The reporters of the Beijing Economic Reform Commission were informed that the capital airport has been in excellent and operational status, the opening of Daikoku International Airport, will enhance the service capacity of the capital aviation.
After moving to Shanghai, Beijing has become our second city with two airports, and Shanghai Hongxian International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, Pudong Airport is similar to international air transport, the future capital airport and Dao airport will also serve the differentiation of domestic and international aviation business, provide a more detailed service.
Odaiba Airport Access, from a business development point of view, more for the capital airport is a good impact.
Capital airport in 2018 passenger throughput exceeded 1 million, ranking the top of the country, but compared to the rapid growth of business needs, there is still a significant poor capacity, especially international flight demand has a great gap.
In order to better serve domestic and foreign passenger travel, business travel and other needs, adapt to Beijing's increasing opening up, and international urban development, Dayi International Airport is positioned as a large international airport, planned to meet the annual passenger throughput of 1 million people in the future, and warehouse throughput of 400 million people.
So, the location of the two airports is not heavy, the difference between different customer groups, there are also enough market space.
From the economic point of view, Daikoku International Airport transportation, will form a double turn effect, to dissolve the situation of Beijing aviation capacity, speed up passenger and cargo throughput growth speed, build the capital aviation double-run incremental cake.
From the user's point of view, with the transportation of Da Lat International Airport, the future does not have to be concentrated in the capital airport, can also reduce the route over the centralized series of problems, such as the length of the pass guarantee time, the passenger boarding speed is slow, indirectly increase the aircraft and passengers in the airport stay time, the airport run by an increase in transportation through the capital airport, in fact, it has also improved the passenger travel experience.
According to the media to go to the large international airport for a variety of transit times and expenses, such as the rapid departure of Beijing directly to the airport from the south five ring high speed, the 50 minutes by car to get to, oil money to return to about 40 yuan, high speed fee of 15 yuan; while the choice of rail traffic to the airport line, according to the distance to 20 km, 30 km limit, the ticket price of 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three hundred and twenty minutes by the public can also take the city, from Beijing west station to the airport station.
Generally speaking, there are a number of transportation options available for citizens to go to Oita Airport, and the cost and time are also within a reasonable range.
And from the development point of view: Taizhou Airport is positioned as a traffic linkup in Jingjin, so the distance from Beijing is a little distant, but strengthened for Hebei, Tianjin's radiation, convenient for more people to travel, the development of the economic significance of Hebei, Tianjin is significant.
In the future, passengers in Hebei and Tianjin can enjoy more international air line services provided by Dao International Airport, which can be seen from the transportation plan of Dao Airport.
In addition to the new airport in Beijing, there are also many highways to connect with Datong Airport and the surrounding area.
This is just like the Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other urban passengers can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via Guangzhou Buddha, Guangzhou and other highways, and residents of Beijing Zhouxuan Langfang, Liaoning District and other places will also benefit from the Oita Airport, to obtain convenient and efficient aviation services.
From this can be seen, Dai International Airport's transportation, not only to increase the runway and several aircraft, whether it is from the competitive side of the enterprise, the consumer experience surface, but also from regional aviation integration, the development of the integration of the Jinjin side, there are profound effects and ideas, not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry for the majority of residents to provide a variety of choice, promote the quality of Beijing's transportation industry to further improve the quality of service, more conducive to promote the development of the overall development of Beijing's transportation development process, stimulating the development of the airport's surrounding regions of economic development.
Therefore, for the transportation of Daikoku airport, we are not only in the economy to count the smallness of the individual, but also to calculate the overall development of the big.

A decade of digital “cloud start” in China - Xinhua Net
If the 2009 Local Site Forum as the origin, 25 to 27 in Hangzhou, the 2019 cloud conference has been carried out for the whole decade.
From the concept of a 'Cloudary', to the practice of 'the cloud', big data, cloud computing in 10 years became one of the core technologies of the development of Chinese economy, social management, public services.
In the Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in the Zhejiang Haiyuan, recently the finalists were filled with a new “coworkers” equipped with Alibaba Cloud AI.
It is 24 hours a day, the identification speed is more than two times the labor, the quality accuracy is stable than 95%.
According to the company's personal description, the camera's "dealer" has focused on learning more than 4 million defective tablets, the cloud behind the candles computing power, it can quickly convert infrared images to binary language, will be flawed battery tablets placed in classification.
This business is just a reflection of today's cloud computing to help make the transformation of the manufacturing industry.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Guide to Implementation of the Enterprise on the Cloud (2018-2020)". By 2020, it was proposed to strive to achieve the enterprise on the cloud awareness and the increase of the stereotypes, and the depth of the cloud proportion and application has increased.
Mr. Wang, the founder of Alibaba Cloud, said that today, the data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge for the digital economy of the key elements of data, opening up the road.
At the same time, the size of China's cloud computing industry has not been growing for 10 years.
"Cloud Computing Development White Paper (2019)" released by the China Institute of Information and Communication in July this year shows that in 2018, the overall market size of China's cloud computing reached 962.8 million yuan, an increase of 39.2% in 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology for the transformation of the financial industry, the development of the digital economy, not to touch the 'cloud' is also unknowingly changed the city management and social life.
At this year's cloud conference, the three-year debut of the "urban brain" is still attracting attention.
Alibaba Cloud Introduction, the current urban brains have become the urban management from the traffic governance tool, the relevant cooperative applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, urban brains through strong computing capabilities, let "pay after parking" "on the real-time perception of number of people" "travel line design" and other new urban management services functions can be achieved.
In the field of civil service, in the "One Cloud" to connect "One Thing", the "handheld office" "handheld thing" is promoted together, the cloud computing for the supply and delivery of civil services has brought convenience to the two end.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified, province-wide public data platform through the government cloud.
As of September 11, this platform has covered more than 5700 people living in the province and more than 1500 legal entities, with a total of 3066 class 190.8 restricted data.
The average monthly data used and shared between government departments in Zhejiang Province has reached 1200 million times, and the data is used to flow on the ‘cloud’ once or more, which may mean that the masses are running less legs.
Prudently wrapped tea with plastic tea!
According to the 'Central Society' reported recently, a new study in Canada found that a package of plastic tea bags may emit tens of thousands or even hundreds of plastic particles, which is higher than the estimated annual amount of microplastics taken by a person, but to date there is no evidence that the extraction of plastic particles will be human makeup weak.
According to reports, researchers at Magil University in Canada found that plastic tea bags were immersed in a cup of almost boiled hot water (95 degrees Celsius), and tea bags would produce about 116 million particles of plastic and 31 small particles of nanoplastics into the cup.
The number of microplastics that is higher than an estimated annual estimate of a person.
According to the study published earlier in 2019, at least 5 million plastic particles are consumed each year, while absorbing the same amount of microplastics.
It is reported that this study was published in the "Environmental Science and Technology Journal", the researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in the Montery Store and coffeehouse, opened the tea bags, wash the tea bags into almost bald water for 5 minutes, and then analyze them with electronic traces of microbes and radiance.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag emit more than 116 million plastic particles, “the plastic loads of the previous other foods are higher than several levels ”.
According to the report, most tea bags are made with natural stained water, but many use natural stained tea bags into tea bags brands are still using plastic to seal.
Some of the brand tea bags are no longer paperless and use plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the subjects of researchers testing.
Plastic particles are small pieces of plastic. Researchers define the size of these microplastics between 100nm to 5mm, mainly produced by plastic garbage decomposition.
Researchers discover plastic particulate traces in air, soil, rivers and deep-sea shores around the world, and these microplastics can also be found in tap water, bottled water, sea turtles and beers.
For the first time in October 2018, researchers discovered plastic particles in human biopsies in several countries around the world.
In order to test the potential toxicity of tea packs that emit plastic particles, the Canadian research team put water flies in water that has been contaminated, and discover that microplastics can affect the behavior of these water flies, and make them appear to develop shape.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) law, there is no evidence to date that plastic particles that are extracted will be deterred by human beings.
However, the WHO pointed out that more research needs to be done to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment, and what impact it has on humanity.
The researchers have advised that these tea bags emit large amounts of plastic particles, which may be the cause of these plastic tea bags grafting with boiling water, even when the "eed grade" plastic heats up to 40 degrees Celsius or above, may also break down or emit toxic substances.
According to Guterres, the climate emergency is the greatest threat to the survival of the small island country.
There, a natural disaster will invade the development of the generation.
This year’s burned by winds like Babuda, Dominica, and Baham all of them.
Around a quarter of the people in small island developing countries live at an altitude of 5 meters or less.
Moves can significantly affect their social and lifestyle, and even cause sovereign and national identity issues.
At this Monday’s Climate Action Summit, the island states are working together to achieve 100% carbon neutral renewable energy by 2030, which has once again led to the world moving in the right direction.
Guterres said: “The climate crisis is pileing new injustices above the old injustices.
Despite the small island development of the country's global warming is very small, paying the highest cost.
As these countries are in the middle income position, many countries are trapped in the accelerated and unsustainable cycle of deafness and debt.
The world must take action, now it is time to make a major decision and make a large investment in small island developing countries. ”
Today's senior meeting passed a political declaration calling for help in the development of small island country management hazard, investment in climate-adaptive infrastructure and the way to renewable energy conversion; urge international institutions to help small island developing countries, especially the cumulative middle-income countries to obtain funds.
The small island developing country is at the forefront of protecting and preserving the planet’s lifeline – the ocean.
The latest special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed that the ocean has suffered from the climate crisis of the 'committee from the's consequences.
By this century, many parts of the world each year may occur some of the original century will occur once the extreme sea level rise.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to have become uninhabitable if they don’t invest a lot of money in terms of adaptation.
Pollution, excessive fishing, and acidification cause huge losses.
In the last 150 years, the world lost half of all living corals, and in the last 40 years, plastic pollution increased ten times.
The demand for industrial, shipping, mining and tourism industries is reducing resources, including the maintenance of many island communities.
The small island country also faces high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, making them floating by prices around.
Some countries are also working to address the safety impacts of illegal populations, weapons and drugs.
“ By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, the problem can be solved anywhere.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples available worldwide. ”
He emphasized that the developing country of Little Island is a case of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment across the international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India said that financial system liquidity is sufficient.
West Taraman, Minister of Finance of India, said 26th that the current financial system is sufficiently liquid, and the Indian economic growth is expected to resume in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by the demand for festivals.

Westaramman, for example, declined in car sales, denied that the liquidity curve was the main reason for the decline in sales.
Car sales decline is mainly caused by cyclical factors, Sitaramman said.
Citraman forecasts that the rate of economic growth in India may resume in the second half of the fiscal year under the drive of festival consumption.
India’s annual shopping season starts in September and continues until the end of the year.
As the market expects, shopping consumption will greatly boost the economic growth of India.

“Some of the overcrowded workers on the site estimated to be more than half.
Where to find a young worker now?
You don’t want to use so many ‘old people’ on the job site, there is no way to do so. ”
Recently, for the construction site there are many ultra-high migrant workers (more than the years of retirement) phenomenon, long in the construction industry to do the construction contractor of the quake feeling.
Recently, the collector's university for a period of time in the stormwater diversion project, there are many migrant workers in the campus, if you are concerned about the observation, you will find that there are a lot of ultra migrant workers here.
The migrant workers who go out of work are not "do not live", but because "can't do it", with "must have it" noisy and choking -- whether it is to settle their old and medical problems, or to help children, all led to these old people who should otherwise "do it" continue to work hard.
The “old according to ” of the migrant workers is not as easy as we imagined.
Education for children, the elderly, for children to read books, to help children to store homes to buy, help children to set up a home, the generation of education, when these farmers complete the 'life mission', the bag has been empty or even have a lot of debt, most of the lack of wealth.
In order not to drag the children also to give themselves a lot of riches, many migrant workers insist on "dry until it is unpleasant."
Many "80" "90" and "00" new generations of migrant workers are not willing to engage in the conditions of hard work, the driving strength of the second industry or low-end service industry, resulting in structural "employment famine", these lack of attractive work, to the migrant workers provide opportunities.
Due to the lack of a skill-long, the body's functions and driving ability has fallen, and many ultra-high civilian workers are very strong, low income, high risk, less protection of work.
The day can be dry is a day, can be a little more, "can not hide" behind the survival of the migrant workers, can not be ignored and disregarded.
Solve the problem of pay and salary, improve the protection of labor, reduce safety risk, increase labor income, improve the survival status of ultra-necessary workers, in addition to their "self-relief", but also free from the public sector system to protect and humanities.
Some scholars pointed out that migrant workers are less likely to rely on home to solve their own problems such as old age and medical treatment, and they must pass through other lawmakers to fuzzy.
Read the "Can't hide" of the super migrant workers and strong, help us better understand the love and pain of super migrant workers.
Seeing the back of the super-voluntary workers, hear their interest, trying to get back to the village of them really achieve 'old-by-law', the need for public sector, the market and society in the virtuous interaction in the division of responsibility, the need for multi-party cooperation.
Chemeyzov said that the system will not be exported in the next five years Russia, because "the first need to supply the national army, after which export production will be carried out."
This practice fully complies with international practice.
The main producer of weapons and military equipment is always the first to ensure the national defense needs before processing the export orders.
Earlier this year, Yuri Grekhov, the head of the Russian Air Force, said the development of the system is about to be completed.
The S-500 system is developed by "Goldstone-Attai" sky prevention consonance.
This is a new generation of air defense system, using the work of destroying the pathological and aerodynamic goals.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept mid-range crossings, which can intercept crossings up to 3500km of crossings.
In addition, according to certain information, the S-500 can also destroy high supersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of drones, more than sound speed 5 times the high supersonic missiles, even in close space targets.
This weapon can also be integrated with other air defense systems as a unified network, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense perspective.
Ms. Chemezov expressed special attention to the S-400.
He said that the system is currently in high demand in the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic area.
The S-400 air defense system enters the NATO Anti-Air Force.
According to the news on September 15, the work of the S-400 anti-air missile system has been completed.
This is not a militant nature of Russia in the North Pole.
The Russian Ministry of Defense says this is entirely a process within the transition plan for more advanced defense tools to the north.
“With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace in the Arctic region has increased.”
It is very important that the system has been successfully used in the north and north regions according to the party’s assessment.
The Air Defense Officer trained the new system and prepared to enter the battle shift.
Previously there was a S-300 remote air defense system, and now still retains part.
As for the air-proof system, it must have weapons that can destroy a variety of air targets, whether it is the target of high-speed flight outside, or close to the protective facilities of the 'whole of the Internet'.
According to public sources, the S-400 "T Triumph" system, developed by "Goldstone-Antee", is designed to attack strategies and strategic aircraft, archaeological missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a 400km radius, and within 60km distance, fall below a 4.8km per second aisle target.
Russia will never stumble upon its deployment of air defense power in the northern part of the region to ensure the air safety of the northern sea.
Shortly before, the first 12 sets of “Tor (Tor) - M2DT” air-guided anti-air missile systems were delivered to the Arctic Region of Russia, which were enough to form a air-conditioning system that strengthened the air-proof system in the Arctic Region.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said at the time that the NATO “Tor” team will expand into a complete tourism-level system in the future.
Together with the new S-400 remote systems deployed on both the New Territories and the Coral Peninsula and the short-range system "Pantsir - SA" in the Aurora Region, these advanced air-proof weapons provide a powerful defense against the Russian's terrestrial sky.
The enemy aircraft, helicopters, and drone missiles will break through this defense.
According to the Russian government's idea, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complex and long process of opening their own stores.

According to the introduction of Alex Korzhevnikov, the new store will sell at least 5 rubles or more of the company's goods.
In practice, my expectations are higher, and the sales of 5 rubbish are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are very impressed with the quality of Russian goods, and show our products as high quality and green environmental protection products.
The popularity of buying a strong Chinese consumer is fierce and increasing, according to Kozhevnikov.
He said: “Our goal is ambitious, with 500 businesses launched through this store in three years.” ”
At the same time, the platform will also list the products of Russian companies in the eastern part of the region.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor of the fundamentals of trade policy at the University of Economics, said: “This is a political project representing the image of the two parties, as the Russian export center is a state rather than a civilian institution.”
“I don’t see a lot of intense Russian goods on the market. ”
He believes that the project is likely not actually implemented, but will help strengthen the two relations.
According to the Russian news agency, Andrey Sleppnev, President of the Russian Export Center, said during the Oriental Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian companies' product information has been published on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, whether it is available in China or in other countries.

There are currently around 50 applications received from Russian agricultural companies.
Russia's export center news article: "In addition to the agricultural exhibition stand, we will still have a business meeting, that is, to arrange a direct connection between entrepreneurs."
“This is another direction we’re working on, with the aim of supporting our business and ensuring it’s arranged for dozens of special meetings.”

The committee said that the way that Ms. Gail Ayton, the boss of Ms. Jianbin Wang, who worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, was “unfairly unfair” and may have rebelled against the anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the shop in 2016, and he had been "want to cheer me out" because she was not a Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, Vice Chairman of the Commission, conducted a search on the Internet, finding “some of the job advertisements Mr. Wang’s past posted on various Australian Chinese employment forums ”.

He said: “I think that the proposer has taken an unrelievable and impartial procedure to dismiss the applicant, Mr. Wang “waits” this opportunity, he believes that it will ‘prove’ to end the employment of the applicant is just. ”
“He shouted ... the shoulder completely ignorantly gave her any natural just treatment when removing the applicant, shockingly, that he was ruthless and unbiased derivation.”

Listed companies in the year buyback size over 1000 million yuan new history high - Xinhua Net
In order to stabilize the company's share price, maintain the company's image, listed companies in the near two years start to buy back the shares frequently, through targeted buy-backs, collect competitive trading and other ways, hope that the value of the company is undervalued this information to the market, so as to stabilize the stock price, enhance investor confidence.
Orient wealth Choice data shows that in 2017, the funds of listed companies for the repurchase of shares were 79 million yuan, rose to 510 million yuan in 2018, since 2019, the total amount of A-share listed company repurchase implementation has exceeded 1000 million yuan, creating a new high of A-share history to return the amount of funds, and far exceeded the previous year.
From the purpose of the buyback, the company's buyback shares and large shareholder increase seem to be the same, but there is a big difference in the implementation of the main body, the source of funds, the use of buyback, the equity itself.
Xu Liu, the chairman of the board of directors of Shanghai Coke Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said in the acceptance of the 'Securities Daily' reporter survey, in November 2018 issued the >, the stock buyback range of narrow, decision-making process complex, inventory system is not perfect and other problems in the current system has been revised, as from the policy side began to encourage the listed companies to buy back shares, so the year the stock buy back significantly increased.
This January, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange formally issued >, these policies, to broaden the source of listed companies' repurchase funds, appropriate and simplified implementation procedures, guide and improve governance arrangements, encourage all types of listed companies to implement stock incentives or employee shareholding plans.
After the announcement of the company's share buyback operation, with more suitable circumstances, the return process is simpler, the stock buyback is also more advantageous.
Repurchase shares in a relatively low position, but also conducive to improving the efficiency of the use of funds of listed companies, thereby increasing the level of earnings per share, improve the yield of assets, reduce the pressure of the company's earnings indicators.
Compared with the larger shareholders, listed companies repurchase shares means greater, but also reflects the active market value management intentions and abundant cash flow of listed companies.
Xu believes that the stock price is undervalued is the main factor of the listed company's repurchase, the company's stock price has been unable to reflect the company's future development prospects, so this company is worth the attention of investors, but can not blindly to invest, you need to pay attention to the financial reports of such listed companies as well as specific business conditions.
There is a large-scale buyback behavior of listed companies, at least indicating the company's development confidence and capital strength.

Ping An recently disclosed the progress of the buyback, the company through centralized bid trading has accrued back 5759 million shares of A shares, accounting for 0.315 percent of the total share capital of the company, total funds paid up to 50 million yuan (excluding transaction fees), the buyback shares will be used for all employee shareholding programs, including but not limited to long-term service plans that the company's general meeting has passed.
Erie shares have been paid 57.92 million yuan for share repurchase, and recently adjusted the use of repurchase shares, from the original plan "repurchase shares will be used as the stock source for the subsequent implementation of equity incentives" changed to "received repurchase of 1.83 million shares, of which 1.52 yuan for the implementation of equity incentives, the remaining 3049 million shares will be used for the resale to reduce registered capital."
Erie shares said that part of the repurchased shares will be noticed, help to further improve the level of earnings per share, and effectively improve the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
On September 25, TCL Group issued a buyback progress announcement show that TCL Group has accumulated 3.59% of the company's shares, a total of 16.5 million yuan.
The TCL Group’s Board of Directors said that the repurchase shares will be used in the employee shareholding scheme, equity incentives, or corporate bonds that can be converted into shares issued by listed companies.

The Standing Committee of Hunan Province, Changsha City Commission, Xiaohu Henghua and engineering machinery manufacturing four main gates - Jiang Xin, Liang Qingan, Ho Qinghua, leafy incense, and then ' Changsha from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing' set a 'little target ' - three five years later to build the world's leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster.
In Changsha to build the world's leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster, with the current trend, is to create the "the strongest surface".
As the capital city of the Republic of China, Changsha out of this dialect, where does it come?
Candle is the strength of a baroque leak.
Participated in the dialogue of the four engineering machinery industry, individual handed out, covering the whole field of heaven, ground, sea, and land: the mountain river intelligent light aircraft, the concrete conveyor pump of the CPC, the whole ground of the three heavy duty cranes, the construction of the reconstruction of the tunnel shield mechanism, its "hard power" can be carried out alone the world, the arrogant group.
After a few days, China had basically no say in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
Time to move, Chinese companies "go out" drive, take the "Belt and Road" initiative of the eastern wind, the acquisition, merger, establishment and other measures, one of the world's leading engineering machinery industry.
Among them, the third heavy duty, China's heavy duty, construction reconstruction, Shanhe intelligent and other engineering machinery enterprises, its output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators, has been a substantial leader in the same kind of enterprises.
The candle is the moment when the camera moves.
Engineering Machinery "Big Four Golds", Changsha Engineering Machinery Industry Cluster leader, is also the global engineering machinery industry's top enterprise.
In the global industry of the river lake, who live, and live well, is the meaning of the hard gas.
Earlier years, the global engineering machinery industry encountered the winter, many of the international well-known engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises drowned down, but Changsha's engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to 'cry winter' when 'winter', self-improvement, self-breaking, through industrial structure transformation, from manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing, not only the past, but the body is more strong.
It is the same power of the politicians who came to the moon.
The development of superior industry, both the need for corporate success, but also the government as a positive position.
The reason why Changsha has the beauty of the 'the metropolis of engineering machinery' is to gather from the upstream to downstream of the whole industry chain, to create a number of related industrial clusters, and by optimizing the operating environment, improve supporting services, simplify the approval process and other dispensing and service measures, enterprise R & D, manufacturing, sales cost is greatly reduced.
Good business structure, so that the construction machinery manufacturing enterprises to come.
The history has brought Changsha to the leading front desk of global engineering machinery, when I don't wait, when rejn isn't.
Whether it is the government, or the enterprise, and other relevant industrial and researchers, etc., should seize the opportunity to follow the above targets, sustained power, for the construction of the strong national contribution of the Huban force.

Research: U.S. National Health Eating Index grows slightly, but still challenged - Zhongxin University
China Newcomer 27th September, according to the U.S. newspaper, recently, a U.S. recent study showed that for 16 years, the U.S. government's health diet index had a moderate growth, from 56 to 58.
But in the case that the divide is 100 points, it is not worth congratulations.
American nationals are still facing the "big challenge" on the diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Fang Fangfang, a professor of nutrition at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said that Americans are still stumbled into foods that may cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc., which are the most common diseases among American people.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on 24th.
Research is based on the U.S. government health survey conducted by 4.4 million adults from 1999 to 2016.
Authors said, “There are visible improvements, but the food challenges still exist ”.
It is reported that these challenges include the reduction of food items containing hunger and fat for U.S. citizens, including snacks, hot dogs, cows, butter, etc.
Research has found that people’s daily diets have increased their intake of these unhealthy fats from 11.5% to 12%, over 10% of the recommended intake limits.
The biggest improvement in U.S. national diet is the reduction of sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still high.
In the daily diet, the intake of sugar should be less than 10%.
For the causes of sugar reduction, researchers believe it is related to the reduction of people's sweet soda with people, but aromatically strong, sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and tomatoes.
American adults have a small increase in the intake of fruits, potatoes, oats, and other whole grain categories.
Data in 2016, however, showed that these foods still account for less than 5% of their daily diets.
Even though people slightly reduce the intake of confectionary, the decrease in juices led to the intake of low quality carbohydrates, but Fang Fang said they still accounted for up to 42% of the daily calories, many of which come from refined white masks and other refined cereals.
The study is based on an individual health survey every two years, which will allow adults to return their food they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health checks have been split every few days since 2003 to ask this question two times.
A government-issued U.S. resident diet guide recommends people to adopt a "healthy diet mode" to reduce the possibility of chronic diseases.
Guide points out that people should be dense enough food, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood that can provide protein, lean meat, poultry meat, eggs, seed foods.
During the study, the number of people suffering from diabetes in the U.S. state nearly doubled, more than 7%, and the rate of obesity has also increased over the years -- today, about 70% of U.S. adults are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease is still the leading cause of death for American citizens.

'
In 2017, the State Council issued the implementation plan for the implementation of partial state-owned capital enrichment social security funds, requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out the pilot point.
According to the introduction, the early work has been achieved.
On the level of the central, three total 67 enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transformation of the work, and the total state-owned capital of about 8601 million.
Where, the Ministry of Finance to carry out the financial resources of the central financial institutions planning work has been basically completed.
Central business planning has a certain size.
On the local level, the company paddling the pre-work carried out.
As of the end of 2018, the basic completion of the pilot points in Zhejiang and Yunnan Province, the state-owned capital of 158 million and 185 million Yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out paddling preparatory work, laid the basis for the next implementation paddling.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resource and Social Security, the State Council, the General Administration of Taxation, the SFC issued a joint notice, the central and local trip some of the state-owned capital enriched social security fund work in 2019 comprehensively launched, and by the end of 2020, the basic completion.
The meeting of the same day was held on the comprehensive promotion of the paddling work made a concrete deployment.
Meeting is strong, it must be practical and efficient to complete the paddling work.
'According to schedule, the paddling work should be basically completed by the end of 2020.
It's a tedious business hour with a heavy task. ”
In general, all regions, departments should be carefully organized, carefully arranged to ensure that the completion of the paddling work according to the requirements; to promote the work, accurately grasp the content of paddling policy; to strengthen communication, timely problem solving.
The National Resources Foundation – starting from the point of the "charging Social Security fund money bag", the destination is to provide strong support for the protection of old age.
However, the bookmaker believes that this is not a simple equity “physical shift”, but rather the “Mathematical Addition” was opened.
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human and Social Affairs, the State Fund, the General Administration of Taxation, the Board of Directors jointly issued the >, a clear schedule of the State-owned Fund for Social Security, that is, the central and local plan for some state-owned capital for enrichment of the Social Security Fund in 2019.
After the publication of the documents, the Ministry of Finance and other departments were implemented very quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance will hold 10% of the industrial and commercial banks, agricultural banks equity to the Social Security Fund, the total value of the two equity funds to transfer the total value of more than 1150 yuan.
According to the provisions, the Social Security Foundation and other successors to the main body as a financial investor, enjoys the right to income, rights of disposal and right to know of the national ownership.
Work, run in the announcement said that this change of rights and interests will not cause changes to the Bank's controlling shareholder and actual controller.
In this regard, the winner believes that similar state equity paddling is not a simple change of ownership, but is able to trigger a series of effects of the "add-on operation".
Some of the first steps of state-owned enterprises to convert social security 'add the results ', naturally it is possible to reflect the national ownership of state-owned enterprises, the development results of the universal sharing.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises in China's economy in most of the important industries and fields, the overall profitability is strong and stable.
Among them, the company is to continue to do good and be strong.
On July 10, the State Council often decides that this year, the comprehensive implementation of some state-owned capital enrichment social security fund work.
The Ministry of Finance said that, will be in concert with the relevant departments, according to the State Council's regular meeting of the deployment, do a comprehensive plan to carry out part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund work, fully reflect the basic pension system on behalf of the international fair and state-owned enterprise development results shared among the people.
The second step of the paddling of the 'adding the results ', is to enhance the sustainability of China's social protection fund, and further practice the basis of the old social security system.
With the aging population, China's social security funds are stressed, and the current as a paddling body of national funds, most of them have the ability to maintain profitability and redundancies, not only can effectively supplement the Social Security Fund, but also provides a source of living water for the Social Security Fund.
There is a calculation shows that the state-owned capital of 3.8 percentage points per trip, you can support the basic pension storage ratio of enterprises under 1 percentage point.
The third step of the paddling result is to add a stabler to the capital market.
The way to earn income for the main unit is "submit the main, operate as a '.
As a financial investor of state-owned capital, the Social Security Fund is the main source of equity dividends.
However, social security funds as value investors in the capital market, has strong operational capabilities of capital.
For state-owned assets in terms of listed assets, social security funds to participate in holdings, will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies, help to improve the level of business management, listed companies and capital markets have a positive impact.
At the same time, the social security fund as the investment trend, the increase of weight of holdings, is conducive to further enhance its influence in the market, and play a 'stabilization' in the market role.
In addition, it is also conducive to fully play the 'value discovery' function of institutional investors, to guide investors to rational investment, value investment.
