Civil rights defender issued a travel warning to Missouri
Because of the discriminatory policies and racism in Missouri, the American Association for the Promotion of Color (NAACP) issued a travel warning to the people of color who are ready to travel to Missouri.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory came into effect on August 28, 2017, and because of a recent series of suspected racial events in Missouri, all African-American travelers, tourists, and people in Missouri should pay special attention to and take prudence when traveling in Missouri, let us know,” the organization’s declaration.
NAACP noted that a recently passed state law has made it more difficult for people to win discriminatory claims, and that the state law has also been somewhat contested by minority groups, which have prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
Acts that violate the rights of citizens are happening to people.
They were parked and stalled or damaged because of their colour, “The Kansas City Star,” said Rod Chappell, president of the Missouri NAACP.
“We have received a lot of input and the number has never been more.”
This is the first such warning issued by the organization in the United States to a particular state.
The organization invokes the University of Missouri’s racial fiction towards Black students and the deaths of Black male Tory Sanders at the age of 28 in Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Sanders died in suspicious situations. He was detained by the Missouri police without alleging a crime while travelling in Missouri.
The consultation also pointed out that the state's chief executive's office in Missouri, a recent report shows that "compared to white, the state's black driver was parked to check 75% more likely."
Chapple said: "The advice is in order to raise people's awareness, warning their family, friends and colleagues about the possible circumstances that may occur in Missouri."
“People need to be prepared, whether it’s bringing the sum money to Missouri or letting them know they’re traveling in the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest data from the FBI’s Report on Hate Crime Program; the state ranked 16th in the country according to the volume of crimes.
Travel warnings are also responding to new laws in Missouri, which will make it more difficult for companies to speak for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration law laws and asked local law authorities to detain immigration officers, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it would increase the number of racial inquiries and issue travel consultations to Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government to other countries, but recently, consultatives have taken this way in response to certain laws and warnings within the U.S. territory.

BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city: let the old feeling "live in a new era"
The news network reported in English on January 18 that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also quickly becoming a modern charming city today.
The Chinese capital has a high-speed and amazing Internet, some people recognize software and other cutting-edge technologies, invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has an inexplicable international energy, and it is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are rich in exploration spirit.
According to the British Broadcasting Company's website on January 16, the German minority Clémens Sesicho said: "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere in the future." He quoted the singer Frank Sinatra song the lyrics of New York City.
“If Sinatra is alive today, it is likely that he will sing the city like Beijing,” said Sesihe, the chief creative officer of the Voyagers. He says that living in this city will make you feel “living in a new era” and always keep up with the trends.
The old man is located in England, but recently lived in Beijing, Simon Norton published an article on the personal blog site 4Corners7Seas said: "People have a sense of being at the center of something big, this feeling is very clear, but it makes many foreigners stay there for a long time. They want to see what it will become, and hope to witness. 」
According to reports, the city’s high-quality internet and a tech-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before.
Andy Penia Fuert, from Manila, the current deputy director of the 'Beijing children' website, said: 'Beijing is quickly changing into a cashless society, the Internet traditional wallet features integrated into the smartphone, so that everyone can more easily deal. '
The report said that, but the smartphone is only the beginning of Beijing's technical ambition, facial recognition software has been very popular, many mobile applications are using this technology for bank transfer and payment, let people enter the apartment and office, and even use it to verify the identity of the network of drivers.
Beijing has also recently announced plans to fund 138 million people to build an artificial intelligence science and technology park, and after completion there will be more than 400 companies to account there, which will focus on developing a variety of artificial intelligence technologies from biological determination to auto-driving cars.
Food is also the core of many major festivals in the Chinese calendar, to participate in these celebrations by foreigners, the spring festival is the most important social and economic festival, but also one of the most accessible festivals for foreigners.
Sahi said: "I recommend to help Chinese friends to prepare for the year, to play apartments and at home to write a New Year greeting on the same important red spring, on the New Year's day, all the family members must be able to eat a grand meal in one room, and then the year to midnight, with the light fire to meet the New Year. For foreigners, with friends and family is the exact integration of this night is an opportunity. 」
According to the report, Beijing has a large number of foreigners and is constantly growing, but the ease of communication between the Chinese language barrier and the people is easy to become the excuse that they do not fully integrate into the local culture.
Saying: "Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but there is little experience in their host country. If your initial interview with the Chinese people is not successful, then you can easily have a sense of ease with other foreigners."
”In the “old alien bubble” of these things, “old alien bubble” refers to foreigners only mixed among foreigners, without touching the local people and local culture – the local people’s notes), foreigners complained in their own community, eating at Western restaurants, and friends only foreigners.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a bit of ordinary words – which is easier than people might imagine.
Saying: 'Two hours a week of Chinese private lessons or learning entry-level radio should be suitable for everyone's busy schedule. '
Learning a classic phrase can also help with shopping, ordering at a restaurant, or chatting on a taxi.

The residents emphasize that it is important to have outdoor activities in the warmer months of pollution that are often wandering, to think of those days as in the historic Hugori or to explore the popular day park.
Norton says: "Beijing is a Chinese city that can find the most things below the surface, and you can find great art and music activities, romantic nightlife, historical wonders, ultramodern business districts, and ancient homogenous districts."

A bit of understanding: Bitcoin’s legal status around the world
Abstract: In addition to the organic nature of the price caused by the review, this digital currency fell also with the 'Accommodation' - the regulatory risk is not related.
From the visual map, the eastern countries of Bitcoin more conservative than the West, accounting for the global main countries are still looking at the legitimacy of the digital currency, on behalf of the 'black sky risk' is growing.
*This article is from Wall Street News (WeChat ID: wallstreetcn), edited by Wang Mu. For more information, visit wallstreetcn.com, or download the Wall Street News App.*
With the overcasting of Bitcoin’s major markets such as China, South Korea, and the European Union, Bitcoin’s global digital currency led by Bitcoin has been baptized since this week, Bitcoin prices fell below a $1 million mental whole number on Tuesday, and the largest single-day decline since three years ago.
In addition to the natural price review caused by speculative properties, the spin digital currency has also been slumped with the ever "accommodation" - the regulatory risk is not related.
At this important threshold, visualize the big data website HowMuch.net produced a chart to show Bitcoin's legality and degree of custody in countries around the world.
As shown in the graph below, green represents the Bitcoin legal market, orange represents the neutral market, may not be publicly legalized Bitcoin status, but there are no main usage restrictions; light pink represents the restricted market, that is, the local government tried through the red line policy or pipe to method the use of digital currency; deep pink represents Bitcoin is defined as illegal countries; gray is not yet rated the country.
(Figure from HowMuch.Net Visualization Team on January 15)
The article pointed out that from the graph of non-green color block distribution can be seen, the traditional sense of the Eastern countries on the bit currency of the more conservative than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of Bitcoin’s largest restricted markets, India is one of the largest countries in which Bitcoin has not yet been rated, nor has it issued a related policy.
North America and Western Europe are the most accepted regions of Bitcoin, that is, the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of Bitcoin in the Middle East and Latin America are clearly divided, and the distribution of color blocks in the above regions is more mixed.
Among them Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are legal Bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and other countries have a certain degree of restrictions on their trading and use, and more of the Latin American countries have no consequences for Bitcoin.
In combination with the above data, 99 countries (or 40%) of the 246 countries understated worldwide have no restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin, i.e. the regions of green and orange.
There are 7 countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (low pink), there are 10 countries (or 4%) defined Bitcoin illegal (deep pink), there are 130 countries (or 53%) do not have more treat digital currency information (gray).
This indicates that countries that occupy the global subject (53%, more than half) are still looking at the legitimacy of Bitcoin-led digital currencies, but also represents Bitcoin's "black sky thorn" is growing, because some of them may eventually make legislative decisions to limit digital currencies.
The article argues that the global regulatory agency has no complete understanding of the new category of digital currency, probably most countries have not made a representation of the main reason.
Although Bitcoin's 'popular' since last year has been an exponential increase, it does not mean that all countries are interested in, some countries may be worried about local laws and thus be under threat, or more conscientious digital coins have been used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street news has written a detailed summary of the news of Bitcoin's international surveillance last week, including China started to host a centralized service online platform and mobile apps for foreign exchange, South Korea is still considering the cryptocurrency exchange, the European Union believes that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warned investors of the risk of "spinning to bloodlessness", and so on.
Wall Street Press Editor-in-Chief > 2018: Global Central Open Digital Currency Year? 》When it was mentioned that from any angle of supervision, acceptance/critique, adoption, 2018 will become the global central bank digital currency year.
Russia and other major countries criticized the legitimacy of Bitcoin, in fact, also in order to release the official digital currency to let the road.

What is the sacred thing?
Trump’s White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most determined sign of the change of regime was when they started attacking the statue.
Both Americans and anyone together did this. So, in 2003, Saddam at Baghdad Paradise Square?
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration’s key think tanks, is sure to know what will happen to the Statue of Liberty when Jim Acosta, President of the United States Cable Television Network (CNN) in an intense discussion on the proposals to restrict legitimate immigration.
It is fair to say that Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did this, a group of tour owners and followers of liberalism will surely swallow him to live.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially in Emanuele in 1903? The famous poetry of Lazarus was engraved on the throne (the memorial was built 17 years after that) and had the meaning.
As Miller v. Acosta said: "I don't want to discuss all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to illuminate the world...
The word you refer to, that is later added, not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
In fact, Miller is correct, but as he himself said, this is not really about history.
This relates to the modern echo of Lazarus’ words, the only country seems to not only invite any old immigrants, but also invite the most lusted people of the elves: “Your tiredness, your distress, or your hustle as a folk craving to breath freely, and/or the hard ones refusing you to hold the beach.”
There is no "suffering person refuses" for a more daring moment on our screen.
Miller did not work in literature reviews, he made it clear that these people would not be welcomed in the United States of the Trump era.
The conflict of this statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: this is actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends who were struck by her words after her death, knew that they were engaged in highly politically.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the connection between France and the American Republicanism through the ancient classical analogies of the feminine as the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her pod, female image is no longer abstract, she has to hang out.
She gave herself a very different name: the displacement mother.
The culmination with this work is a successful feminist regime and a testament to Native Americanism.
Just like Lazarus has changed the statue, the right wingers have always wanted to change it back to their original intentions.
Rush Limbaugh, the great actor who was a baptist of Trump’s time, said in 2010, liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and he is now an early new conservative who brought America’s intelligent flames to a foolish world: “Goddes of Liberty is a courageous one.”
She meant to bring free torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
Torches are not the way to illuminate America.”
What is different is that Limbo is actually being struck by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive angle.
Lazarus’ approach to imaginative imagination is to be able to see it. When tired, tiresome, but full of hopeful people will be able to see it on board the boat after a long and often terrible journey.
From the surface, it relates to the problems that those who seek asylum, who have the opportunity to improve their lives, who view the world from the perspective.
Her statue was brought to them and needed the hope and welcome intentions they received.
Of course, this is not what Miller and Trump had wanted to admit.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to ignite the hate of their only source of strength.

2017: Neil Black highly represented Scottish National Team members from the British National Team
Eilidh Doyle reunited with only two Scottishs from the UK National Team.
Neil, executive director of the British TAN, Black, said that the clashes in the group consisting of 16 strong Scottishs will "make great contributions to the national team."
The number of Scottish athletes selected for the Friday opening of the 2017 London Athletics World Championship was the best in history.
Black argued that 'Sugland is getting extraordinary development', British field athletes must learn from secondary school.
“We accept and try to understand this, and we will stick to it until we succeed,” Black said.
“I was looking for people at the Scottish College of Sports to speak. They thought it was related to their role.
Scottish Athletics as it relates to their work.
The British Athletic Association thinks it is related to their work.
This is what people who are on the street think.
Whatever the case, it is extremely powerful."
Several Scottish offenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, will be at 5,000 meters as high as Mo Farah, while Elidh Doyle is the head of the team.
“The Elid is a little awkward.
Her captain's speech is truly incredible ”, Black says.
“Many field activists, regardless of whether they live or train for the Scottishs, or wherever they live and get out of the door are proud of themselves and get out of the door.
“The passion and true feelings of Elid’s natural investment are very good.”
The winner of the 400-metre crossover race in its fifth World Race, said 16 Scottishs in the British National Team, which is "invisible".
Previously, there were a maximum of seven Scottish Athletics at the World Championship, which was achieved in 1983 and 2015.
In the past year, she had five British records and two European records.
She will compete in a 1500-meter and 5000-meter project.
O'Hare is another Scottish fighter who deserves to be aware of the 1500m project matches, before which she achieved a good track record in the season, winning the UK nationals against the election and the Olympic Games respectively.
Doil recalled her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scottish men in the team were Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she was very proud that her so many fellow citizens joined the team not only, but also in some cases, will also challenge the medals and fight into the finals.
"Becoming a national team leader is special because it is voted by other members of the national team. Therefore, know that your teammates vote for you to take advantage of the unusual achievements, no matter how, for me, it is a great pleasure", she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all of the Scotlanders.
It just shows how far we have gone.
And they are the veterans of the field of the field, who are the coming of the purpose of the pilgrimage landing stage.
What is my team leader like?
Well, I think it's great.
I just took a look at the fact that in this case, we are very lucky because we played the tournament in the home.
Therefore, it is really important that we use the support of the home, as well as because of our return to the Olympic Stadium.
I will be given a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere will be incomprehensible.”
In 2016, China was a total of 18 million employees, the employee fee was up to 1218 million, an increase of 21% year-on-year.
Masked critics on the book: Don't chew the public if you can't endure the burden of the voters
Our fathers learned about the work of bad media.
American people are in Washington, but shortly after, the major newspapers began to violently ignite everything he had, from domestic policies to political principles, one never to spare.
He has no doubt about these criticisms.
But he didn't shy these critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington has said, “The freedom of speech is cursed – and we will be cursed like a Lamb in silence and foolishness.”
This made me think of Maryland Governor Larry Hogan who needed to learn from Washington.
Hogan's agents block and remove posts of at least 450 people because they post their own views on the official homepage of his book.
The American Civil Liberties Alliance made a statement to him earlier this week.
The governor argued that the rate was very grassy, and that the online report was filled with their strong revolt: "Who cares?"
Many people say, "It's just a book."
But, it's important.
This is especially important because it is confronted by people like Hogan.
This is a republican of the majority of the state's republican governors in a democracy, and he is surprisingly popular.
Among the 50 governors in the country, he was ranked second in terms of good ratings.
Hogan is not a reactionary sharp molecule.
He is in charge of Maryland and obeys the rules in good practice.
He is also very good at the book as the main way to connect with the voters, playfully on the main page to show the first of his work after the transformation.
So there is no need to mask people to comment on the homepage of the governor, and in the end, it is also very dangerous. This homepage is a public forum, which is the official management platform of the Public Health Grants Specialists tab.
In a survey of the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson, Amilia Sas, who took care of the governor's behavior, believes that blocking their reviews is more than trying to get them a little restrained.
But they are divided by grass rates to describe it as flooding or thirsty vulners of the sweeping circuit.
The Washington Post and the person blocked by the Hogan face-to-face.
They are only ordinary people speaking to their own leadership: their identity is a teacher, a small business owner and a pastor, and not what the flood was scarce.
They lying on that their comments had depth, respect, and did not flow.
This shepherd cites the words of the Bible in his post, calling Hogan’s cry for his Catholic faith.
Lachymy Salma Lamani, a barrister in March of Maryland, did not crush, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the news story review section of The Washington Post, “I’m hollowly commented and I’m disappointed that he didn’t respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also do not like to help people comment on the same topic, because they will be ignored directly by certain people, think they are the sent psychological, rather than treating them as citizens of a group of villagers."
The "dense garbage information fried" as the governor may appear to others as "adjudicated".
It's easy to change a piece of information in the era of the book, just to block a critics or remove a negative comment.
And also cleared far more than in the past, in the past era to do the same effect in the same time need to send the staff out to collect and stupid the speech of criticism or arrest or embarrassment of the protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, but it's on the digital side.
Hogan is not the first public official to be alleged to have been heard because of discriminating others in a book and other social media.
President Trump is being tweeted because he blocked them on Twitter.
Last week in Virginia there was a landmark ruling on such issues.
According to James C. Carthries, the district judge of the American state of Alexandria, the chairman of the Board of Supervisors for the County of County’s Bureau of Supervision, who shielded the behavior of voters from her book’s homepage has opposed the First Amendment.
Governor of Kentucky Matt Bevin (R) is also shined by the United States Civil Liberties Union for his use of peer-to-peer books and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
In the Washington era, significant fees and Internet charges have similar influences.
The number of news newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and there were also people writing anonymity to criticize his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington also had a plague on his anonymous flood.
People use pseudonymous names such as Eureka, Wallelius, Bellissari, Pouses and others to criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to the historical documents collected by George Washington Newspaper online project, his office was overwhelmingly asked to criticize his attitude with the United Kingdom's "King of the United Kingdom" and the United States of America's friendly, commercial and maritime covenant.
But he did not embarrass them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of different political opinions and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
And the real leader needs to accept this.
The city’s arsenal of blowing herbs impresses the sensitive nerves of people.

In addition, there are cities or areas such as Kunshan, Shanghai, China, and other cities or areas have also introduced a 'talent introduction' related policies, the purchase of talent to lower the door.
Grand Master believes that this is actually the major cities for the population, especially the talent of the master, the retention of the population, especially the talent, the city is only competitive, which is the most important meaning of these real estate policies.
Some people even believe that this means the "limited order" cancellation time of the building has arrived.

Half an hour later, the glowing red potatoes were forced to be taken out by a hand that had not been washed, and were swollen by the tiger.
Daisy sits on the mud – she has no furniture, and here is where she does everyday family routines, such as laundry, laundry water, and so forth, are all made from nearby bows and bows.
A roofless room with a bucket, which is an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she was not divided into fields to take care of.
polygamy is very common here.
Of course it is dangerous to work lately: most of the men in the village do not work, and many are drunk like mud, plus a lot of soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk in the village after 5 p.m.,” she said.
This is a rare glimpse of the daily life of Papua Heights, once a colony in the Netherlands, after the 1969 referendum and entered Indonesia, but the referendum was also subjected to a final vote, when only 1026 seniors were forced to vote by hand in front of the army that occupied the country.
The movement of independence and opposition to the Dutch rule is now strongly demanding that the conflict will soon be directed to the government of Jakarta, because the government imposes a high degree of autonomy in the region, segregation of foreign nationals and defenders.
In 2003, the province formally divided into the provinces of Papua and the provinces of West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.

In 2015 alone, Philip mined about 31 USD worth of gold and silver.
In addition, Papua’s wood resources are very rich with an estimated value of $780 million.
But these wealthy resources are also the source of the tragic tragicness of the Papuans, and the powerful power of power in Indonesia is therefore only able to curb them all the time.
The New York Times reported a 2005 survey showing that Philip paid nearly $2 million to local officers and troops between 1998 and 2004, and $150,000 for a single official.

A 2016 report by the Archbishop of Brisbane, Catholic Diocese of Brisbane, titled “We Will Lose Everything” consists of proof of the impressive previous year, such as extrajudicial executions and tortures—another report argues that power is particularly common—and the stumblings of demonstrations on peaceful parades.
Human rights research group Indonesian researcher Andreas Harsono said, "The violence occurs every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims."
Papua’s resources are recruiting a large number of immigrants outside of Indonesia, and forced to begin.
83% of the 350 million people in the province are Christians, but the structure of the Muslim economy has changed since the arrival of the densely populated Java Island, Kalimantan Island, Sumatra Island, and Sulawesi.
The cricket's snacks are sold with added extras of fries and vegetables mixed with peanut fermentation.
Locals struggle to fight.
Abos Yu, a 24-year-old Panya native, moved to the province of Chaapura to find a job, he explained that "the immigrants started selling pork and vegetables at a lower price than the local Papuan people in the traditional market.
This resulted in the local Papuan-female (mama-mama) – losing their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo (commonly known as Jokovic) sweared to solve inequities and abuses in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
This former carpenter’s road to the President’s House in Jakarta is supported by 27 parts of all 29 – including Paniania.
But none of Papua has changed, and today, the local feeling has been betrayed.
"We have been heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted to Sakovy, hoping that he could achieve our hope and restore fairness again."
In fact, after just two months in October, Paney had experienced the most terrible disappointments.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Anarotari singed a singing of saints before a bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly struck a motorcycle.
Affected children told them that they should open the car.
According to local pastors, one of the soldiers was angry with them, and four of them came back.
Victims and eyewitness claim these drunk soldiers strike with their guns following these groups of children.
Then one of the soldiers opened the gun against the children.
The 16-year-old Julianus Vladimir was lost because he was defeated.
A few hours later, the nearby government agency selected the committee to blame the bear fire, and the next day the incident was upgraded.
Around 1,000 men, women, and children of Papua, gathered in front of a football field in the local police and military centers demanding an extradition.
They carry a chord of practical use, jumping in the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua – the circle running and imitating the birds.
Some of the protesters begin to throw stones often.
According to an official document recorded by Time magazine, when emotions are sustained, soldiers receive an order via the internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, immediately defeated." But this document has not been released to the local media.
The 56-year-old Jeremiah’s Caya is the head of the Nenarotali Kego Koto neighborhood, and he felt that it was about to be at risk, so he called upon the crowd to be cold, and sought to return to them.
But no one has a mood to hear him.
He was standing on the doorway of his shaded wooden house, saying the Time magazine "When I'm back, my left was suddenly gunned."
Kaya wood is still not sure now that it is a gun that lie, but he says that the zigzag is from among the gathered soldiers.
He said again, "At that time, they opened a lot of guns."
According to the brothers of the local Olfus Jurer church, he witnessed the guns and saw the three guns in Olfus Jurer.
Youhanes sadly told the magazine "Time", "I've run to check if his body sees him or not,
I found out that he was dead...I kissed him.”
Juger Mende, the governor of the Papuan police, told the reporter that his subordinate was only in the "protective" police station, because the police station was taken up.
In 2015, Papua police spokesperson, police officer Pugio Sulistio called "some people want us to take good care of when we are."
This is a matter of life and death.
According to the Human Rights Watch Group, five years of crackdowns were targeted, and more people were wounded.
The next day news about this hammer is only slowly spread out in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zovy made a sympathy and mourning in Chaapur, expressing sympathy for the victim’s family, and swearing to solve the problem of the administrative rights of the history of Papua.
He said, "I hope this case can be solved as soon as possible, so that this will not happen in the future." 」
In October 2016, Secretary of Security Fernando said he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the issue of human rights violations.
But the borrowing of the presumed also took a few signs.
He said, “Most of the abuses occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have been committed to addressing these violations, but this also requires a process.”
Then on June 5, in Jakarta, Vilando was surrendered in a conversation with the Time magazine, stating that he did not have a plan to establish an application mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “everything will be resolved according to law.”
The United Nations has filed a charge against Fernando de Verano for the death of more than 1000 people in an independent vote for the Bloody of Timor-Leste in 1999, but he said that 11 human rights violations in the region of Papua have been resolved, including the Panian.
The family of the victims of the Pania incident felt nose to these claims.
Yuhanes said, "In the last three years, I have accepted four interviews, but things have not progressed at all."
After many years he said, "I'm tired."
He is still living in fear now.
He said, "I'm afraid.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army and being struck."
His brother Yukabs also argued that the people of Panion were afraid of discussing the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping bury four victims.
He said, "After he buried a corpse, the enemy came to me."
The gun has not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police attacked villagers in Panya County.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a man who was obsessed with going to a hospital, conflicting side, death of one person, and 17 others, including children.
The 24-year-old man Lavianus Dowood drowns during the winding of the nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's live office.
The police said the villagers had thrown stones from the police, so the police would open a warning.
But the Force of Terror (Indonesian captain police) began to squad with the crowd, and one person was stalled.
The 29-year-old Doming Valley Badi told the Time magazine that "We were panicd at the time, and now they were afraid of revenge." He lived near the hospital, and at the time witnessed that the two had been rushed into the hospital.
“I had two days at home.”
The Deyait Council has called for the law involving police officers and evacuated the atrocities forces from the area.
Panai has always been a non-local to the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has sprawled the people of the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes, which are scattered across the central highlands of Pani’s Ayling.
Many people joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel squad claiming to protect the rights of the Papuans through dispersed slums and turbulent Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the free Papua sports high-level leaders were born in Panion, including Tadius Yuge and Daniel Judas Cogoya.
In recent years, thousands of Panai men have been arrested under the guise of defending state sovereignty by the military, and deliberately detained.
Some people no longer appear.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Paney is a "forgotten place of tragedy".
It's a long bow.
Anarotali has less than enough rice to sell, and locals can't afford to buy at all.
The bread is simply unattainable.
Here people grow everything they can eat: mainly red potatoes and some fruits and stick vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five hundred hundred hundred hundred hundred hundred lice.
They usually use most of the harvest writers, the remaining ones on the local market.
The ten robbers are worth only 1 million Indonesian robbers (75 cents).
As time lapses, economic inequality has been pulled out of local Papuans and new immigrants, and the number of these immigrants has increased dramatically since the opening of the new route to the airport.
A small number of jobs now often fall into the hands of better educated and wealthier immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have funds or required skills to operate highly competitive companies.
“Adolescents don’t want to stay in this village...because there is no job here and no credit.”
Papua and the rest of the world.
The restrictions of the international media coverage are still very good.
Earlier this year, French prisoners Frank Escudi and Basel Ronneur were shot out of Papua, because they "do not cooperate with the authorities", even if they have been rarely granted permission to shoot.
According to the Human Rights Watch Group, Asia Under-Secretary-General Felim Kane, Zokovi withdraws reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development of the choice of oaths did not implement.
In a statement, he said, “If a foreigner tried to report the indecent provinces of Papua and West Papua in the eastern part of Indonesia, they had a new risk: the denial of the visa and the pull-in blacklist.”
No media supervision means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is basically limited to the country of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands – asked the UN Human Rights Council to regulate the “all kinds of universal human rights violations” in Chababa, including the Panyi Regime.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Armanata Nasil, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, did not care about the group's allegations, he told the reporter of Jakarta, "Indonesia is still implementing a democratic system, and the media freedom, so the evidence of human rights violations is inadvertent." 」
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to.
According to an informed person, on May 4, the Dutch ambassador for Human Rights, Chris Bar, led the official representative to visit Chayapra, when the local people broke the silence and pleaded that "we want freedom." He also participated in the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will be under the next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to return to Zokovy.
"The intention of Zokovi is good, but he is concerned that he is involved in the Panyi gun."
He wanted Zokovi to know that the Paney people were not only under the power of the greedy, but that there was little education and public health care in the area.
The Gobai Panai people like other Papuans believe that their vote for Zovy is his must-have debt.
He said, “They don’t need money, and they need justice.”
Even under the threat and intimidation, the family members of the victims of Paney’s assault still made their last symbolic revolt: burying a victim in the face of the military police officer’s whistle.
They know that justice will never come, but at least they will not let those culprits forget about their sins.
Yukabs low said, "My family was put to death,
What can we do?

The fire swallows the SkyPoint of Dubai “fire” again
On Friday, the tallest residential building in the world, Dubai, forced hundreds of residents to escape this 337-meter-high, 79-story ultra tall building.
This is the second high-rise building in just two years, and it happens in a skyscraper called the Torch.
The building has been evacuated and there has been no crowded reports and has not been found the cause of the fire.
"We are sleeping, and then we are waking up by fire, and people are starting to scream.
It takes about 10 minutes from the 50th floor, “a resident called George told Reuters.
The civil defense authorities in Dubai said that the fire team had squeezed a fire around the local time (Greenwich Mean Time 0000) at about 4 o'clock and that it was working on cooling down for the building.
The government said it was working to provide a safe place for those affected.
The accident may once again raise concerns around the world about the safety of materials used in tall buildings.
A study conducted by the "fire torch" skyscraper management after its fire in 2015, found that most of the objects that were damaged were decorative and applied to the overridden wall.
The British police have stated that they believe that problems with the insulation and insulation panel system in the London-Colononfeld building could be the cause of the rapid spread of the June fire, which caused about 80 people to die.
Williams Fleet also hints that Mass is likely to return, even though he has announced his retirement.

Just over two months ago, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics ticket sales rate was also only 32%, the Winter Olympics ticket sales rate is only 4.3%, the low fans of the ticket sales rate once made the outside world's popularity of Pyeongchang Winter Games.
But as the President of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Committee, Mr. Li Xiaowen shortly earlier predicted by the reporter, 'With the Winter Games of the Holy Fire across Korea, the winter Games of the heat is increasingly high, I believe that ticket sales will soon be better.'

Investigation finds that over one-fifth of U.S. travelers carry restricted items on board
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20% of the passengers had intentionally or unintentionally brought illegal items to board through the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoint, with at least 6% of the passengers unwillingly carrying a ban knives or other carry-on.

The company called the investigation of the number of travelers nationwide in order to understand the number of people who carry unplanned and deliberately carry prohibited over-air aircraft aircraft on board.
Not surprisingly, it is the most likely person to carry the restraint – intentional or unintentional – those who fly the most often.
However, the company pointed out that the TSA guidelines are a little more complex to understand.
People are usually not sure what kind of liquid they can carry and how much.
That’s why it’s no surprise that the TSA has won the most, just as it’s a ban on liquids.
People have once believed that the TSA may also serve as a prohibited article.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Minister Pruter's change of the Obama era rule of reduction
One day after being ruled by 15 states, Director of Environmental Protection Scott Pruter changed his decision to implement the Obama era to reduce emissions of vapor air pollutants.
Pult proposed this change, as compared to the previous government, the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of environmental regulatory state bodies.
He did not mention the legal challenge that the Federal Court of Appeals raised against his predecessors.
The focus is on setting the end of October 1 to implement the 2015 ground ozone standard for states.
In June, Pult announced that he would be extending its performance for one year in order to allow the Environment Protection Authority more time to study the program to avoid “interfering with local decision-making or obstructing economic growth.”
Prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump, Prut was General Inspector General of the State of Oklahoma and has long opposed the strictization of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prut has repeatedly stopped or promoted the laws of the chemical and fossil fuel industry against it.
A sudden reversal on Wednesday is the latest legal disorder in the Pruter Stewardship process.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency stepped up, trying to push forward the Obama administration’s requirements for oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Pult proposed his degree of ozone standards for the degree of tolerance, said to strengthen the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the state to carry out cooperation, to take the complex procedures to reach a new standard.
Pult said, 'In the previous administration, the Environmental Protection Bureau usually does not reach the specified period, and then the radicals and other people, and then agreed to determine the specified timetable through the agreement. 'He used to work on the Environmental Protection Bureau began ten times.
“We don’t believe in the chauffeuring through word, we treat the deadlines seriously.
We also treat the law and the authorities seriously."

The Republican Party in Congress is pushing for major changes to the ozone protocol.
The House of Commons Act approved last month was intended to be implemented in 2015 for a period of at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
Secretary General Eric Schneiderman of New York led the League of States this week to speak to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, saying he intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneidermann said: "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s countermeasures – after our submission – for the health and safety of 670 New Yorkers, it is important for the health and safety of more than 1.15 American communities to be directly affected by smoging emissions."
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia all joined New York in this case.
Ground ozone is the formation of automotive, power generation plant, oil plant, chemical plant and other sources of emissions of common pollutants in the atmosphere under sunlight irradiation.
The resulting cigarettes can cause severe respiratory problems to sensitive groups, causing thousands of people to die prematurely every year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered the exciting shifts in Pratt.
Lori An Bird, Biodiversity Center, said: “It’s disturbing that this routine measure has been immensely stressed by people from sectors that protect the air we need to breathe.”
“We must fight against the Trump administration for thought movements that cater to polluters and special interests.”

Moore’s Crime: Activists Recreate Racial Selfish Criminality, Reaching Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car crossing a group of runners in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, on a small Moorish stroll.
On the vehicle there are four black passengers and a white driver, before the vehicle arrives in the bridge, a group of white men with guns before going to the road ahead of the car.
This helps the thug's head - a middle-aged man wearing a fine Western coat - to suck a cigar and shine into the glass of the eyes.
Passengers in the car are full of panic.
"We want - Roger!" The man shouted.
“Drag him out of the car!”
A young black was dragged down from the front passenger seat, screaming that the sword broke the silence.
Fortunately, July 22th is just a repeat of this terrible scene.
However, when the "Roger"'s neck was put on the sleeve, almost all of the hustle and bustle sent a real respite.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Murdoch and present two scenes for the night of the Black Couple - Roger and Dossi Marcon as well as George and Merley Dosi - 1946, who were killed by three K's private prisoners.
No one has ever been accused of embarrassment.
“Of course, we know that they are who, even though we have seen them in the community, but for these years they have not been arrested by one person, which is really convincing,” helped the organization to re-run the re-arranged Tyson Brooks sermons.
“It is the stains of history, the relics of our souls.”
Brooks 71 years old, a former Georgian activist and activist activist.
For him, re-run is a striking call to action, reminding the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice never gets right.
“We think of it, we want to settle, we want to heal, we want to settle, but we must first get justice,” he said.
“Unless we get justice, we can’t get healing and reconciliation.”
On July 27, 1946, the Commissioner sat down a bed linen on the victim of a Moorish Private Prison.
More than 50 men from both Monroe and Zhou are suspected of participating in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to news from the National Broadcasting Corporation.
But no one of them has been raped.
It is likely that the suspects have been in a state outside of law for decades, but civil rights activists say that the implementation of private prison of heavy motives throughout the city is well known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed Black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the primaries later in the summer of that year.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for Statistics, around the same time, Black gangster Roger Malcomm paddled the White Landlord Bennett Hearst in a fight -- it seems like it was for a woman.
Brooks says that the rumor on the town is Herst sleeping in Malcolm's wife, Docy, and her baby is not her husband.
On July 25, 1946, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) claimed that Lloyd Harrison, who became the white landlord of the hug, spent $600 to emit Marcom bails.
Dorsey and the brothers, Michael Murray and George Dolsi, accompany him to the confectionery.
But when they came back from the prison, and quickly came to Moore’s shame, a group of private prisoners brought the car up.
“It turns out that the Harrison organization and commands the execution of this pole,” a FBI report concluded the conclusion.
“It’s clear that there’s something between state and local law enforcement, and they don’t just participate in embarrassing, proving evidence, and reciting the identity of the witness.”
Brooks is very succinct.
He said, “It’s a polling slaughter.”
“They were slaughtered by the fact that they sent messages to black people in the community: ‘If you register and vote, you will also encounter the same endings.”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been leading Moore’s annual replay of the private prison case.
Her manifestation of expression, intriguing, has a deep racism background. Many people want that racism no longer exist in the United States.
It's very difficult to see, and it's even more difficult to see, but Green says it's the key.
“We don’t want to talk about the private punishment, because the private punishment has made us face the face of everyone,” she said.
“But if you don’t hear my speech, or don’t hear me about your experience, I can’t establish a relationship with you.”
This year's performance began in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day - ten whites, the rest of which are black - in a house where you can listen to a brief overview of the performance released by Greener.
The co-director of Reed Malding as Green.
For many years, he has played a role in the three K-bits, but he says that the role has never been easier.
“I feel very awkward, because I am not such a man,” Mark said.
"But I think it's important to keep this historylive because we don't want to go back to that era again."
Darios Bradshaw and Nick Lascona, the actor of Roger Malcom and Bennett Hearst, in the room, are among the queuing their tales.
At the beginning of the game, Malcolm shouted and pushed out of Herster, feeling less than he had sleeped his wife, Dobissy.
“I said, let go of my earth!”
Rascona back to the path.
Then they hit up.
Then everyone (at least all Black actors) bursts out a joke.
Green smiles are the most damaging.
"What about it?!," Lascona asked.
He was afflicted and confused.
I'm acting too much?
"No," Green smiles.
“I just don’t say ‘Ah’ when I think the white is back.”
"Yes," another black actor playing fun.
“Your tone must be tough.”
That way, the energy in the room has changed; the sense of friendliness has gone unwell.
Everyone is trying to do this, not only to perform the game, but also to commemorate the four encounterers.
The scene starts again.
This time, Lascona said the word "Ah", the sharpness is strong.
There is no one laughter.
A powerful and rapid replay is over.
Screaming screams, guns, and then, is a silence.
A woman in a funeral black coat stands in the body of an actor, singing Billy Haram's whispering of the "unquity fruit".

Brooks took them to the cemetery of Malcomb and Dormitory to worship the offering, almost eight hours away, and all endure the unpleasant sensations of Georgia.
Until this time, the murderer is still a fan. But now, standing on the same land in which the private prison took place, the air rolls out the anxiety.
When the song's last note disappears, Green asks people to look close to some subjects played by the actors.
Kids look down on their heads, look at shampoos and bodies, and practice each other’s private language.
"They're not really dead," a little boy shaking himself, as if they were reminded of himself.
After a few minutes, Green senses the crowd and then ends the performance.
The cast slashed the eyes of the private prisoner.
Brad Shore holds a three-K-headed western-fitting male Marson.
Nick Rascona holding his two fellows crying in their mourning; the emotions in the performance end up infecting him.
"Not related," one of the women in low language.
“We know that your heart is not that way.
There’s a reason why you’re doing it.”
After that, come and sit down with the cast for dinner.
At the same table, a pair of white husbands from Atlanta and their relatives chat closely with a black couple that they encounter about the resurrected thing.
Dennis Duprinsky is eager to find the word describing how she feels after watching it.
"It's difficult to imagine those terrible words and actions...but they say and make them like you, because they look like you," she said.
"That's for me, really made me think that the private punishment is still being carried out," she added, "Now is just called police guns."
In the room, the titanium Brooks sits next to the table to see, taste and reverence of civic rights.
He said he had begun planning for the next year's performance.
“Replay is an inspiring way because it describes the horror we have experienced, but it is also very educational,” he said.
“If you don’t learn to teach from it, that kind of thing can happen again.
Those who do not study, do not understand their history, are destined to be important to repeat."

Media: China Air Force Engineering University Scientists Research Laser Star, Used to Clear Space Debris
The American media said that Chinese scientists have proposed a proposal to innovate, using large lasers to clean the earth’s track, and to destroy the old moon and its sky garbage.
According to the U.S. Newsweek website on January 15, reported that researchers of the China Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled 'Sky-based laser clear small-scale space fragmentation model study', the paper describes how through the use of the sky-based platform laser, space fragmentation can be seen by the laser into smaller, harm less so large fragment.
Reported over the years, space waste has been a concern for the international space agency, the U.S. Space Agency considered a variety of options to track, detect, and remove artificial fragments.
The method of clearing large-scale space fragments includes giant nets used to clean and collect waste objects, as well as the magnetics that can be used to suck them into the track. Chinese scientists conducted a laser simulation study, which concluded that this will be an effective way to clean the earth's track.
Abstract of the paper said: ' (imitation study) the sky-based platform laser clear space fragment technology application provides the necessary theoretical basis. '
Research by U.S. national defense giant Lockheed-Martin company in 2014 found that there are about 200 traces per day for satellites that are running along the track.
The high-speed fragments along the Earth's orbiting movement are seen as a serious threat to the mission of the future space, described by the experts of the European Space Agency as "a deadly string of threats." Each year in the past, high-speed fragments are constantly increasing.
According to the U.S. "World Machinery" monthly website on January 17, reported that space is basically empty, but the earth's space has become increasingly overwhelming. We sent each of the stars in space will eventually turn into another piece of Earth's run, and these fragments will be stacked up as time passes.
The more fragments, a block is still in the normal operation of the satellite is the higher the chance of being fragmented, thereby dampening or destroying a value of millions of dollars in investment.
All space agencies have plans to clear space waste in the future, according to the report.
NASA is thinking about reducing the speed of debris by irradiating the gas, making it debris, Europe is considering the launch of a large network of satellites, capturing debris, bringing back the earth, the idea of Japan is to capture debris with a electric link.
In the eyes, China also proposes a method to solve space waste, that is, to use a large laser to spill space garbage into less harmful small pieces.
According to a group of researchers at the University of Air Force Engineering in Germany > published a paper, installing this laser on a satellite will be enough to effectively clean up space, at least according to the simulation results is this.
The only way to verify the validity of the report is to conduct a test, there is currently no such task arrangement, but there will be someone in the morning on the satellite to install the laser and then send it into space.
Once it’s done, we can end up with the problem of eliminating space waste forever.

Latest results of the Sweden avoider year assessment test
The latest method of assessing their age from medically, the latest results suggest that more than 80% of test takers are judged to be over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Forensic Center (R?ttsmedicalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After referring to the age of those who failed to accurately evaluate some of the allegedly underaged, the Swedish Immigration Bureau (Migrationsverket) designed these tests to be more accurate in the avoidance process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Department has sent 6880 testers, and the Forensics Center has announced the results of 2481 testers from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
80% (2002 people) were judged to be 18 years of age or older, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine "may be 18 years of age or older".
In the 432 test, the result was this person "possibly under 18 years of age."
Test only those who have doubts about the age.
According to John Granson of the French Medical Center, these results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
He told The Local: “These data are not much different from those of the previous few months, and the numbers are very consistent.”
The percentage of cases that have been determined to reach the age of 18 or older does not necessarily mean that those who have avoided reported their years.
In May, the Center announced the results of the 581 test and called 442 cases “represented that this tester has been 18 years of age or older.”
Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of the 581 test, finding that 243 of the test takers had publicly represented that they were 18 years old this year.
An X-ray check of the intellectuals, the joint magnetic resonance scan, and then analyzed by the dental doctor and radiology physicians, this medical evaluation method is also questioned in some parts of the region.
One of the suspects is Caroline Academy's endocrinologist, Kirk Marcus, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine if they have experienced adolescence earlier than or later than normal years.
Metro: “I have reason to think, and I think the measurement method should not be used.
In this way, it is very inaccurate to determine the physiological age.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend to do so."
However, the French medical center of Glenn's care for the accuracy of these tests: "Overall, it is possible to determine that a child is very small in uncertainty for adults." 」
The biggest risk is that this person is not yet 18 years old, which is about 10%.

What does the financial rules of the football community mean for Neymar to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent the European Union football club from spending unrestricted will not prevent the price from being transferred from the Barcelona club of Spain to the French Saint-Germain football club (PSG).
The consequence of this is that the League of European Football Associations (UEFA) has stepped up the football club of Saint Germains in Paris. The League of European Football Associations is the governing body of European football competitions, and has the right to ban teams from participating in the widely-loved UEFA Champions League.
The 2011 UEFA Financial Fair Readiness (FFP) means that the Paris Saint-Germain football club must, at the end, prove that the transfer of Innermar will receive funding without causing a huge loss.
The Barcelona Club has paid $2.22 Euro (2.62 $) only to pay the Brazilian player's settlement, while the Inner salary will be up to thousands of dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial implications of the Nemar Pass to France.
The football club of Saint Germains, Paris, has certainly been able to use cash to enrol him in the army of other stars in the clouds.
Club can spend big money to buy players, but they must use legitimate income sources to transfer big money, so that they in the football related business to achieve a balance of earnings.
The Financial Fair Dating Rules were conceived by Michelle? Michel Platini following his 2007 election as president of the UEFA Confederation.
The former French player believes that for those clubs that pursue success, if the bank or all of them withdraw support funds, they are actually in the bullying, the set of clubs in the bullies.
In 2011, the "rule" focus points from the club issues to the Club's crash monitoring.
This change means that Rome? Roman Abramovich acquired the business model used in Chelsea Club in 2003, that is, buying a potential club, then spending big money improving the team and building it up a global brand, now in more demanding places.
During the three-year rule assessment period as of 2018, the club may lose 3000 €.
Despite being held by the President in 2015, Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to stopping overexpenses.
“Of course, the Rule has not been invalidated, and we will definitely strengthen the law of the future ”, Andrew of the EU Federal Congress of the Rule of the matter? Andrea Traverso told the Associated Press last week.
Of course, the football club of Saint-Germain in Paris will pay the purchase terms in one lump sum, but it can also be used for the purpose of the contract period according to the allocation of gold amount.
Nemar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee may be shown as a fee of €4440 in the next five years’ annual accounts.
The first wave of the rule sanctions imposed in 2014 brought the football club of Saint-Germain in Paris and the Manchester City club of Abu Dhabi under the auspices of the most serious sanctions.
The football club of Saint Germaine is judged as €6000 ($8200 by the current exchange rate) and subsequently reduced to €2000 and required that the Champions League in 2014-15 reduce the player to 21 instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking at the clubs that try to increase revenue through encounters with the club owners and bullying financial regulators.
Unfortunately, Qatar’s companies can sponsor the football club of Saint Germain, but if the amount of the grant is considered to exceed the standard market price, then the UEFA will not be considered as a legitimate income.
This is what happened in 2014, when the UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Office helped the Paris Saint-Germain football club to be bothered.
According to reports, a portion of Innermar's revenue in the Saint Germain football club in Paris may come from the 2022 Qatar World Cup Commission payment.
However, the football club of Saint Germain and the committee will meet innemar as the ambassador of the World Cup, and the bureau of the UEFA supervisory authority, to make such measures is easy.
Recent sanctions on the football club of Saint-Germain in Paris mean that the UEFA will be more vigilant of any attempted rules.
According to people familiar with the matter on Thursday, UEFA had not made a prior discussion with the football club of Saint-Germain in Paris regarding the reign of Nemar.
The above people are only unnamed to contact the Associated Press as they are not authorized to discuss the status of football clubs in Saint Germaine, Paris.
According to the last announcement, the sales revenue of Saint-Germain football club in 2015-16 was 5.424 Euros, earning more than 1000 Euros.
The agenda for the previous fiscal year has not been announced.
The Saint-Germain football club in Paris is expected to join Nemar to bring the gospel to support events, special offers and jersey sales.
The Club expects the end of Innermar harvest to grow by at least 30%.
Obviously, see one of the most famous players leaving, the Spanish League is very angry, trying to block the movement of the Brazilian Federal, and claiming that the football club of Saint-Germain in Paris is back to the Rules.
Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, 'It's together 'financial matter' of the obvious testimonial, the club and the country are the same', refers to the Saint-Germain football club in Paris has the ultimate ownership of Qatar.
Arsenal Team (the owner of the club is the American sports tycoon) Bishop of Arsenal? Arsene Wenger, the national funding club's attitude and the West Bundesliga are reserved.
“It’s the fruit of ownership, and this has changed the entire life of football for the past 15 years,” says Wingle Thursday.
“Once the country has a club, then anything will happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, because for a country, there are many different ways or various interests to require the players of the big card to represent a country.

And there are multiple voice actors - including Jenny Slater, Nick Offman, Mahshashashashasbaz Ali, and Colo Sevini - to create a wonderful sound festival.
However, Snoopy is so committed to creating a hustle and hustle-like campaign comedy - there is a head-rooted face in the movie - and it usually also plays this role.
This six-set long TV is slightly dragged, and the precipitation effect is not fast enough or frequent.

High-quality life: application of the building and clever design, the Piaget Small Apartments created as a spacious home
Annie Ray was a former banker, and she was passionate about refurbishing her house. In 2014, she moved from a large house in the whirlpool to a small Piaget apartment.
This apartment is located on the floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace -- Anne has not picked up luggage to sell it, which is a powerful demonstration of the new design.
“Before that, I stayed with my ex-boys in a larger house in the Kao,” says Anne.
"I was looking for the right house with the offer at the time.
I saw this apartment in the Earl's Palace and its ceilings are also high.
I would like to ask for an offer on the day.”
This 1,000-square-foot apartment has now been fully renovated since watching the house for the first time.
This apartment was originally a complex piece of layout -- it was necessary to pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- Cui Anne wanted to increase the storage space and floor to make full use of the ceiling height.
“I want high ceilings, large windows, ample light.
This is my request, “She said.”
To that end, she hired Ervan Azadi from Duck&Shed’s architecture and design studio (located in Nottingham) to take advantage of this 12.5-foot ceiling to create a home carefully. The home is not only a development project, but also a place where Man Anne lives.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to increase two upper and lower space, so the building challenge is to create a floor that is highly enough to stand up.
Ervan must play a creative mind, so that we can solve this problem.
“The structure is quite complex,” he explained.
“We have to arrange a good space to make it up and down, and there is no need for a shoulder back.
Not only is it as simple as building a simple platform, but also has to start the supplies to make them fit in the right height of the implementation function around."
Through this arrangement, Ervan is able to obtain two full-body rooms in the space - which can add many interesting elements.
The floor uses Retrovius’s vintage windows and overlooks the charming living area.
The golden furniture, silver widget furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting set the overall style.
The use of the mirror plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space, and light.
In the short hallway two-side dressing a mirror that can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the anti-sanding board with the mirror is like the window that goes to another room.
At the close of the cutlery, a small cell with a mirror provides storage space for Annie for the storage of tableware and glassware.
A beautiful guest house has an intriguing sense of space that can pick up the kitchen when the kitchen is not in use.
The discounted kitchen is not new.
But the uniqueness of this discounted kitchen is in a garage-style lift door.
“There is some knowledge of the field of engineering here,” Ervan explained the reinforced face of the MDF door.
"It uses the principle of balancing, so it's easy to swipe when you push the door."
Thanks to clever use of space and survivor, Annie gains 16 square meters, more bedrooms and an improved layout.
"Finally, what you're talking about is housing -- or saying that your real estate valuation is based on housing," Elvan said.
"Basically speaking, real estate brokers will go into the room and calculate according to the size of the floor."
They will try to increase their space while using high-quality materials, bringing a sense of luxury to this space.
“Materials are your pick, so they help create emotional bond at home,” Ervan said.
“You won’t love the power on your wall.
These things are important, but they won’t shake you up.”
It turns out that with good design and increased overhead, standard apartments make you feel amazing.
In fact, you may choose to live with Anne.

Two brothers playing 5 U.S. Dollar Real Estate Empire War
After 40 years in its Italian family, two brothers were worth 5 dollars, one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires launched a war.
Former Calton football club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a luxury house in Tucara district while the three bedrooms are located in the residence of his younger brother Paul. The latter has sued him to the Supreme Court on the division of their real estate and business assets.
Since 2014, Paul has been looking to spill out family businesses, but two brothers have divide their assets in the Supreme Court to start a heated debate.
The siblings and their mothers have a total of 38 real estate properties worth more than five dollars, and these real estate properties have been accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually developed it to 160 retail stores.
In 1999, the company was sold for $8500 million.
After that, the money was put into real estate. Currently, the De?rutis family’s portfolio of assets includes urban office building, Brunswick and Sorrento development projects, Gold Coast and Black Mountain apartments, and suburban shopping centers.
According to the agreement with its deceased father, Paul was called by his brother De? Rutis family of "main promoters and dominant figures" Corin has about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounted for about one-third.
The documents filed to the Court that, in terms of concessions, Corin has a property value of $3.16 million while Paul has a property value of $1.76 million.
Paul believes that the division of real estate and cash proves to be the symptom of the business.
“The property division proposal presented by Colin left him the property that I considered the best,” he wrote in an oath in the first court in 2015.
On Friday, the Supreme Court first held a hearing after several misunderstandings.
Now, these brothers are holding control over existing businesses, and Paul says he has kicked out.
Corlin has denied this, and says Paul has failed to manage some properties.
In the early oaths filed by Collin, he said he wanted to solve it.
“My Italian tradition decides the family is the most important option. My Italian tradition decides the family is the most important ”, he said.
The cost of the case continues to rise and there are hundreds of affidavits, emails, as well as reports filed by top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, etc., as well as senior lawyers hired by the parties.
Lady Rutis and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy. They had been running grand delicacies and delicates since the end of the 20th century and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 70s.
They used collateral to buy Collingwood property, where Colling opened the family’s first jeans boutique.
Corin said, "I read three times high," and he founded Westco there, "At the time, Paul was still small (about 10 years old)."
Ruthis says she and the Louisville who passed away in 2012 hope to bring property peace to her son
“Louis Vuitton often said to me that he would never want his brothers to finally come to the court,” she said.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke are no longer a member of De? Ruthis Group, who paid him 1000 million dollars when he left the company and paid $2600 million to Luke.
Paul says that both Luke and Mark are “impaired” of their property division terms.”
Based on TV star Eddie McGuire, who was on the board of directors of former AFL Club, was published by Eddie McGuire in 2015, but remained low.
“Fairfax Media” contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, as well as their lawyers.
However, only Colin responded by text message. He said, because the case has been submitted to the court "I really can't say too much."
“My brother Paul chose to recall me and bring our family affairs to the court, which is very, very desirable,” he said.
In mid 2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet the demands of his brothers.
He said: "Our father did not want to see Paul and I finally happened so-so-ever," and added that he "still had hope for the solution to the end."
Friday, this hope seems to be broken.
"Our questions will be solved by the court in the near future", Corin says.

Trump’s New Directorate Plans to Restrict President’s Media Time
Others have also tried it, but they have been told inadvertently.
John F. Kelly is also really able to do it.
If so, he is the first man.
According to Politico, the new White Curtain Chief Plan restricts the flow of information to President Trump — including news reports — to ensure that the bosses are more stable.
Here is a quote from the reporter, Josh Dossier:
"When the new Chief of White Curtain Chief John F. Kelly began working on the first day of the discussion with senior officials gathering, he pointed out that he was going to solve a major issue in Trump's presidential White House: the flow of bad information into the hands of the president."
Probably told these officers that receiving good information helps the President to make better decisions, so the information needs to go through his hand - whether written or informative.
Wylie’s diagnoses seem to be similar, but others have also tried to bow them through watching Trump’s media time, but they’ve never been lost.
President Trump’s TV has been on the horizon for a long time – now in White House, he watched the TV’s erroneousness is still deepening.
In February, the candidate asked Sam Naberg, saying Politico, “If Trump’s candidate feels like an unfair report, let him know that he is also benefiting from a positive report on credible channels.”
Politico's Tara Palmeri then wrote, "The focus of controlling Trump's tweets is to ensure that his personal receive media messages have been a certain amount of embarrassment, according to the experience of six former officials."
That's not a problem at all.
But Trump’s tweets were ridiculous when he “controlled” the view.
Probably these dignitaries know something we don’t know – that if they don’t have their intervention, Trump’s tweets will even be more frivolous.
We may never know which Twitter Trump did not send.
If his staff were able to save him in the fire of water, even if they had only a few times, their efforts were also worth it.
But no one is able to stop Trump from causing confusion all the time.
Part of the problem is that in a white straits of competing groups, people are proclaiming their worldviews by making possible or unreliable information to Trump that could be reliable or might be unreliable, flowering to drive their cause.
Politico – is all about this story – May reports a hobbies that various advisors have provided suspicious information to the president’s strategic approach.
This is an example of the description of the reporter Sean Goodman:
“Now with former Trump officials saying that Trump’s reaction to news feeds such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, he would madly want to find its source.
At the end of February, there was intention that a copy of an article on the website GotNews.com of the network incited the molecular Charles C. Johnson gave the president the control of the deputy chief of the article, Katie Walsh, the White House “the source of a large amount of information disclosure”, was then the performance of Trump.
Even if John has been permanently banned from Twitter for his whimsical use, there has been no specific evidence, and he has exploded a lot of false control, and later it is fair to say no.
Trump looked at the article and began consulting with officials about the situation of Walsh.”
Mr. Goodman also said that the curtain of the chief, Reins Pribass and Rob Porter, " tried to build a system to manage and record the documents Trump received."
What about the results?
Kelly intends to do the same thing in three months later.
Perhaps he can prove that he is a more efficient steward than PLYBAS, but Trump is also the driving Trump, and his helpers are still competing against each other and greatly influencing each other.
These eternal influences can add up to the smoothest tasks.

Italy Takes Strong Difficulty on NGO Migrant Rescue Ships
Italy issued a warning to non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue ships in the Mediterranean, and they would have to continue to implement the rescue without enacting a new code of action management.
"If the NGO does not sign new norms of conduct, it is difficult to see why they will consider it."
The day before the warning in Minneapolis, Italy official suspicion that the German aid organization "Youth Relief" on a ship crew actually colluded the population of the bearer and assisted the illegal immigrants and detained it.
The aid organization operates for one year and refuses to comment on the specific charges of Italian inspector Ambrogio Caltocio.
The group said in a social media statement that "for us, salvation of life is now, and will be the most important thing in the future, so we regret that it is not currently possible to run in the search and rescue area."
“After all the information has been collected, we can currently only evaluate all all the charges and the situation.”
Italian official has been monitoring the boat Iuventa from the Youth Relief group since October.
The crew is suspected of carrying the immigrant directly from the ship by the population carrier, and allows the smuggled persons to escape and re-use the ship.
According to the inspector's documentation, at least one of these meetings is reported to have occurred at sea 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast. The documentation is published by the Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, who is out of humanitarian passion rather than any other motorist to oversee the rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, Iuventa ships only need an Italian police officer to monitor their activities on board.
Currently, among the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue operation, only three have agreed to abide by the code of conduct: Save the Children, Malta-based Immigration Sea Aid Station and Spain-based Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said Thursday that it argues that the new rules are not necessary, but can be accepted, as these rules do not bring any "significant changes and obstructions" to its rescue operations.

Michelle Carter is sentenced to death by Conrad Roy, who is mourning for texting
A MASSA woman is sentenced to two and a half years for self-determination by a boyfriend via text message and telephone.
The current 20-year-old Michelle? Carter will be sentenced to 15 months and can be converted into a bow sentence.
In June, Carter was sentenced to Conrad Roy’s inadvertent non-predictive plague, who died on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s Father’s testimony on Thursday will say, “My family is heartfelt.
My son is my best friend.”
During the waiting period, Carter was granted to keep himself free.
She has been sentenced to imprisonment for up to 20 years, but her attorney believes she and Mr. Roy are all mentally ill.
At the time of proclamation, Carter stands, wearing red longs and beige shirts, double hand buckle, double eye with bows, looking down.
“Her actions died Conrad? Roy, prosecutors told the court.
“She ends his life in order to live better.
She has no commitment to ”, as inspectors say.
“She doesn’t have any repentance.”
But Carter’s attorney said it was “a terrible consequence that she was very repenting.”
However, the Justice Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find her “a degree of age or maturity, and even her mental illness would have any significant impact on her actions.”
An inspector who reads a statement by Mother Lynn Roy, said, “I didn’t have to worry about losing my beloved son one day.”
I want him to be proud of everything I do and I do. I am trying to stand together in all my pains and with his sisters who will be with us forever ”, according to the statement.
Mr. Ray’s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was “spiritual” because she was conscious that she would never be able to participate in her brother’s marriage or to become his child’s hustle and bustle.
“Losing a man who has been with me since my birth is a pain, and my amateur life will be with that pain.” She said.
This case seems to have created a precedent because the law of Massachusetts does not envisage that others are guilty of themselves.
In 2014, Roy was found to die of carbon monoxide poisoning in the car; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
Kat's text message reveals her regret that the case has attracted national attention since he had done so.
"Up hanging, jumping, assassinating himself, there are many ways." She said in the number of text messages sent two weeks before his death; at the time he was on vacation with his family.
During the time before his own time, she wrote: "You need to do this, Conrad", "All you have to do is start the generator, and then you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter had come to the attention of Mr. Roy’s death and ordered her not to receive money from the case through any media.
There are legal disagreements in this case.
One of them, Amanda Knox, who was accused of taking care of her British household in Italy in 2007, was declared innocent two years later.
Ms. Nox, 30 years old, in a Los Angeles Times article, said: “Michel? Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment.”

Automotive manufacturers face, Audi will transform up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before Audi announced the renovation, BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 cars.
The President of BMW said that BMW believes that “more smart choices, not restrictions,” refer to major European cities – including Munich, where BMW is headquartered – to prohibit or limit diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will be remodeling Europe's 300-million Mercedes cars to reduce their diesel emissions.
No company claims this as a recall.
European automakers are promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help achieve CO2 emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered to be cancer-causing substances and may lead to asthma.
The cost of installing equipment for automotive companies to offset diesel tail emissions is also increasing, so it is difficult to keep diesel vehicles competitive at prices.
With the review of the German automaker, Prime Minister Angela Merkel’s leading government has also been accused of overtaking these powerful auto companies and ignoring the varieties of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid recurrence, that is, dismantle its use of the dismantle device, adjusting the emissions in the car test to comply with the regulations, and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Several senior executives have been charged with the U.S., and other executives are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic coast.
In the last month, the former thermodynamics of the AUDI MACHINE R&D department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager Zachero Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore not protected by extradition, may be sentenced to death in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was circulated into a German criminal investigation involving the Great Congress, and the German government accused Audi of evading European emissions requirements, greatly extending its previously limited scope to the United States of censorship.
Audi was investigated to have a significant impact on the Greater China: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate percentage of the car.
A movie, from the preparation to the release, is available for two years to many years.
An animated film, "The Great Canal", was announced today that it will be released on July 8, and the film will be available from the preparation to the release of the 12 years!
The original author of "Dahle Sea" Liangxi, 21 years old from Tsinghua University's hot power professional, and friends of the spring to create the other side of the day, in 2008 won the United source of millions of dollars of venture investment, launched the animation film virgin "Dahle Sea Factory."
The film has received numerous awards at home and abroad, and has been picked up by the Pompidou Centre for Contemporary Art in France as “one of the most outstanding artworks”.
The film is called the "Sacre" because it has been made for six years from the date of creativity to the time it was made.
The Great tsunami describes a fantasy story belonging to the Chinese. With the release of the scheduled trailer, it brings new expectations to all of its sights.

"I always want to use one-fifty others to budget, make and others exactly the same type of surface effect, the team must be forced by me." 」
Dongguan, which once relied on the "world factory" of material processing and a large number of ordinary workers, is looking towards high-level talents who can reposition the city.
Recently, Dongguan City Government's high-class personnel activities week, the first financial broker to see that some of the local powerful enterprises to participate in the consultation.
On the billboards in the orange background, they each marked a good price.
Therefore, the Chinese TV production industry association will decide, the national television production industry, to sign the self-discipline Convention.
The lavender of Provence is the threat of climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is a bad news that it is under threat from climate change.
Lavender is decay due to continuous dryness and the presence of a virus insects, which makes it painless for scientists and elders who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, expert at CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The lavender of Provence is on the front of a huge threat, because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, and rainfall has been dramatically reduced in the spring, and the autumn rain is sturdy.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a personal small pole, a pole that can spread small germs, in very dry weather, they will appear a lot. "
The key lies in its huge number.
In addition to the attractive resort, lavender oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric? Cais said: "In contrast to the can open a lot of flowers, with a very long valley plant, there is a problem of personal smallness, poor development, missing or weakness."
So our essential oils have less content.”
Solutions currently being studied include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the evaporation of bow soil moisture, protective mixtures of hydrated clay and water on the plant strain, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
Compared with the science fiction elements in the film, the starring two shows that they are more appealing to the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, the reporter of the city of Western China, a number of famous people from the photo world, there are two photo artists, and it is surprising that they are almost consistent with silence.
One of Berlin’s shadows, one of the rising young cast, is the first time psychological sin comes to life with Li Yifeng.
The danger of Mexico is heavy, and news reporters are stalled
All Riodoce employees of the weekly Riodoce are often gathered on Wednesday to review their report plans for the state of Arizona, which are caused by criminal organizations, corruption officials, and endless drug warfare.
But today, the tragic shadow shrouds them themselves, and they come together to discuss security issues.
They were told to change their daily routine, which is important.
Two veterans discussed what makes them more safe: exactly it would take their children to the office (the office had been handed over in 2009) or it would leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the boards in front of the room: enemies, neutrals, and allies.
They made each of these reporters their names listed below - no evidence is required, observations and intuitiveness is enough.
There are doubts about poisoning, politicians, merchants and journalists on the government list, or Carter, which helps to make Mexico’s coverage dangerous.
Violence has never ceased, and the whole country has spread over the wild, with more and more people: according to the records of the Committee of Safeguarders, since President Enrique Peña Nieto was present in December 2012, at least 25 people have died; 589 journalists have been protected by the federal state after they have been afflicted and threatened; and so far this year, at least 7 people have died in 7 states.
The last death was their source of edits and inspiration, as well as the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdiz Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist,” Vardiz wrote a lot of books about drug violence in one of them.
You can deeply feel that he has left, although he is everywhere - a huge picture of him in the front of Riodoce's office building, Valditz stared at the middle of the table, with the words "genuine"; Alan Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, two of the 30 years old men wearing the T-shirt also showing his smile, he wearing the glasses or his iconic Barnama Herbs.
The symposium will be held less than two months after his death; the people will speak out on their common ideas, mortals, insomnia and many doubts.
It was possible that in 2010 a special Federal Office of Attorneys was set up to handle the case of the offender, but according to the records of the Committee of Protectors, the office only speaks for two people.
Most of the thousands of crime cases each year involve poisoning and organizing crime, so rarely it is possible to do so by dealing with the perpetrators of the perpetrators.
In Riodoce, they persuaded to reports of violence in the state of Arizona, though they had been heartbroken and dare the land had hundreds of holes.
Ivala said that there is no humiliation of information, there is no expedition, so it is not much useful to convene a security forum.
He said that "the waste time to participate in this seminar would be really stupid.
As long as we don’t know why, you don’t believe anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdíz left the office of Riodoce in the capital Culiacan.
His red color, Juan Carlora, was only out of the streets, and was coveted by two men; and they persecuted him from his drive, and left 12 guns, guessing it was because of the name of the newspaper, translated into the twelve rivers.
The gangster left his car and destroyed it nearby.
Vardiz is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two adult children.
Culiacán rumors.
But there is actually nothing about Valditz except silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and extradited the United States in January, the state of presenta has become the country's bloodiest battlefield, each with a fight against Perlievere madness.
Every day, on the streets of the state of Sanaru state, one or several individuals were magnified, and the graveyard robbed the graves of two graves of poisonous majesty, which are already empty.
The state of “flat” is a moment when only one Carter controls the state of the ocean and its port and drug routes to the United States.
Even so, even if Valditz knew deeply about the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old Riodoce co-founder and director, Ismel Bohoque is still angry because he didn’t protect his friends.
He believed that two sermons caused this tragedy.
First, in February, Damaso Lopez was published and he led a cartel group in battle with a few sons of Guzman.
The report may anger the sons; the report was purchased by suspected helpers once sent to the report.
The second false is another report that reported the same story after being forfeited without forced Waldiz to leave Mexico for his own safety exam.
Valditz is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to the violence of the Mexican opponents.
His spiritual longevity, his friends and colleagues believe he has been with us.
In 2003, he was also a veteran of Noroeste, who co-founded Riodoce with five colleagues, which sold $50 shares.
Bohoque said, in the state of Toronto, “it’s impossible to get to the news industry without dealing with drug issues.”
With the passage of time, the report won the splendor of great truth, the amount of sales and advertising has also increased.
People prefer to be able to publish an in-depth investigation report without being scrutinized, and readers also like to publish stories that others are afraid of reporting.
Riodoce won the news of the American family of Maria Moskopo after five years of its founding.
The same year the Society of Protectors awarded the Valditz International Press Freedom Award for his courage to pursue the most authentic Mexican drug coverage.
He said he was also scared.
When the protector association was awarded the prize, he said, "I want to continue to live."
Later in the late October, he said in a survey of local television Rompeviento TV, “In the state of Sanaro, poisoning is a lifestyle,”
You must carry on the task that falls on your shoulder as a journalist - either so, or to decorate it.
I don’t want to be asked, ‘face so many deaths, what do you do... Why don’t you speak for what’s happening?”
"Riodoce" all the staff were to miss Valdíz, I miss him like a yard worker, I miss this friend who never regrets holding with advice, and I miss the teacher who knows how to live.
They were dependent on his miserables.
He used to wear the hat.
Always go to the El Guayabo bar opposite the office and always sit on the same table.
Now, what would they ask: Is his daily routine causing his fall?
His death also allowed them to think about how to work and live well.
Bohoque says, “They don’t like you to be annoyed by their women and children, nor do they like you to influence their legitimate company and the secret airport for the delivery of drugs.
These all pass their bottom line.”
The result is to maintain a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection even at the safest of times.
Believe in your own intuition.
If you are in danger of the gas, travel away.
Riodoce[edit] Andreas Villarille said the problem is, "The breath is a feeling of being bullied... then there will be something havail naïve."
He and others say that the previous rules no longer apply to the state of SanaLo – just as they no longer apply to the state of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, with the lucrative lines of the smuggling of those states, while the agencies are tiny, government officials corrupt, urging.
The situation is changed in no time.
In the "Riodoce" employees participate in safety training room, suddenly do not allow the use of mobile phones; a few days ago, according to the only sale of spy software to the government in Mexico has been used to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers plunge under the spill to avoid the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They are state agencies to protect Riodoce’s offices, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle of Central Culiacán neighborhood.
Some reporters talk about the fact that they don't know that these police will not belong to the governor's own words of that faith is not too much.
The journalists have gone to the mountains for a few months, and there is a drug group under the control of the actual existence.
The Riodoce this week is about three major events.
Among them, the brothers of Hurio Sesar Chaves, the great ex-boxer of the state of Sonarro, were killed,
There are also government disclosures of state parents,
As well as the scaffolding event in the Annes restaurant in Culiacan, this restaurant is only one block from the office of the inspectors.
There is no official release of information about being framed objects and the shelf process, so it needs to be prudent and prudent when writing out what the city knows: that's where the restaurant is to be toxic and the official are all loved.
A journalist learned from a public case that the restaurant was registered under a politician in the Revolutionary Party of the Politburo (PRI), and that almost all of the above subjects dominate the political agenda.
Recently, a few revolutionary governors have been accused of corruption in several highly valued cases.
Villarill asked the whistleblower to write about what happened at the place of the incident, including an incident in Mexico where a son of giant poison Zugzman avoided the collapse of the incident.
If a few months ago, the reader will look at the essence of Valditz to find the most powerful information about this shelf event.
The 46-year-old Villariel said, "In the past, we have known what has happened because of the thinness of the body, the man called "thin".
All our sources of information are now bogged down.
The offices of Valditz are now used to hide the marks and sticks of the victims of the dampens, as employees become the ones they never wanted to be: representatives of the blades of the media.
The next morning the prisoner Miriam Ramirez caught a flag out of the room and went to the local inspector’s office to participate in a tour related to another reporter.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the West after three days of Waldiz's death.
The official discovery of a focused body and called the DNA test, this is his body.
Across the country, journalists have become more intrusive and organized against the words “save the media” on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, the director Bohoque is not in Washington, and he is working hard to reach justice for the Wardize case and take advantage of international support.
Valditz was hit on the next day, during a meeting with the governor of the state of Jonaro, Ramirez charged with the official spying message and killed them because they had spoken of the facts.
Rhinting her anger has affected her pessimisticity, and she also asked to report on her government affairs.
Waldiz once reiterated that Mexico's prisoners were organized into crimes, siloed government officials, and indifferent societies "warming".
In his last book, Drug News, he writes that the prisoners are not only slaughtered by the drug collectives, but also on the list of politicians and security forces that have been polluted with the organization of crime.
The media surveillance group Articulo 19 will sinned against police and public officials by spoofing more than half of the journalists last year.
Ramirez said, “In Mexico, they let you die in order to make you cry.”
Obviously, these croissants are chilling.
There was no one to forget six years ago, the blogger, Maria Isaiah, died in the border of northern Tamaulipas.
Her body has a statement next to the word "I'm reporting for me" that says it was signed by Tuas Cater.
Her buds are cut off and put on a laptop keyboard and headphones next to them.
After being killed in March, Miroslava Bréch shuts down some of the filing options, such as El Norte, the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others are still continuing, but the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo in 2014 were still continuing.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez made a headline open to the drug cartel, titled “What do you want to get from us?”
Some journalists have fled their homes, or even left the country.
It is a difficult choice.
In exile it is difficult to find a job, and they still need to be cautious and wary.
Sometimes they would be arrested, according to photojournalist Ruben Espinosa who was attacked in a Mexican city and four women three months after the fleeing of Veracruz in 2015.
For those who continue to work behind the scenes, this is the daily dance of high-risk decision-making.
Ivala once wanted to be a vague man, who told him about drug trade to make him panic.
He said, “Mexico is becoming a land arrogant, so I am a journalist.”
Recently, the latest issue of the five-week half-night newspaper has been printed, and the editors of Riodoce sat on the walkway outside of the office drinking beer, suddenly, their phone wore.
A series of wars have been held against the Ministry of Justice and Safety near the beach resort city of Mazatlan, which has confirmed the death of 19 people.
War is also being upgraded, as is the case with a series of Cartel information forecasts discovered in the region.
They are on the way to the Riodoce website by mobile.
The next day's headline has to be changed.
Police robbers in the neighborhood—the region’s guns that have happened to live and die together.
Bohoque has taken a look at the police officers standing there to guard, and see if they are police guarded.
If they have dirt-scared, then they did not show up.
The report’s founder is already dead, and on his large portrait, he points to the entire state of Jonaro where he needs to look up, the whole of Riodoce followed him at his pace.
Bohque said: "How can you even want to shut down?" Haville was stuck on the same day, the practitioners asked me to send her to the street to participate in the report. 」
China self-driving car tourism in 2020 market size or breakthrough
[Abstract] in the context of consumer upgrades and free travel popular, self-tour by the national policy encouragement as well as more and more consumers love.
But at the same time, it is expected to break through the massive self-driving market.
Against the backdrop of consumer upgrade and popularity of free travel, cruises are encouraged by national policy and more consumers love it.
But at the same time, it is expected to break through the size of the tourism market also has a significant challenge, on the one hand, the development of the tourism industry and market demand is not proportional to the self-driving club and travel agencies and other self-driving groups face the slightest profitability of the plight; on the other hand, the self-driving tours face the infrastructure and services are also in the primary stage.
60% of total domestic tourism, the market size is expected to break
In 2016, 44.4 million domestic tourism, tourism accounted for about 60% of the total number of domestic tourism, the size of the driving market is expected to break through the quadrants by 2020.
According to the statistics of the Chinese Association of Tourism Vehicles on the number of people driving from the car, in the past five years from the sustained growth of the number of tourists driving from the country, the proportion of the number of tourists from the country is stable at more than half.
At the same time, the regions and countries face more attention and support from the arrival of this new field, from 2016 to 2017, the policy laws related to self-driving cars, car rentals and camping tourism intensive departures.
In July 2017, the National Tourism Board, the National Sports General Administration and other eight departments jointly released the >; same month, the reform commission, the Ministry of Finance and other 14 departments jointly issued the >, since the tour is heavily mentioned.
The introduction of policy, providing opportunities and policy guidance for domestic self-driving development.
Since the driving club profit is slim, the complete industry chain is the key
The natural domestic driving potential of the market, national policy and guidance, but the driving industry is still in the primary stage.
According to "2016-2017 China's annual development report of self-driving tour" shows that the domestic self-driving tour club, car club, car comrades and other reached thousands of homes, but tourists self-arrange the proportion of self-driving out of the tour accounted for most, participation of the car comrades, self-driving club and other institutions of various kinds of tourists accounted for about 15%.
At the same time, independent research and development of tourism products from the online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies are also a hit number, many online travel platforms sold is just some of the suppliers to provide the self-driving products, some self-driving club is also an important supplier.
From the organization's driving activities, covering 'eating, living, walking, visiting, buying, drinking' multiple aspects, the degree of fragmentation is high, the upstream supply chain is heavy, tourists spend a large degree.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing Pedestrian Motors Club, thinks that the driving club itself and the travel agency is similar, the early main profit model is mainly under the following activities, the core point is from the driving line products and team services.
However, since the driving field domestic road products and the quality of the high, the level of service of the team is poor, and the demand for re-transformation has been the driving club.
It can be seen that from the tour itself is not an independent industry, but with its self-driving transfer characteristics formed a cross-regional, industry circle, the formation of a complete industrial chain is very important.
Experts pointed out that in addition to the basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, should enhance the experience characteristics, the development of the 'self-driving +' theme as well as the IP of self-driving product.
The Scenic Drive is not just the road, the car farm should not only meet the accommodation
In the face of the adventure, the basic development of the exploration of the same species is also compared to primary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourist scenery is not just a way, but the need to integrate the elements of traffic and tourism in the inside, but the road and do tourism itself is two departments to take control, the transportation sector to add tourism elements, but also stay in the construction site, consulting center, publicity station and other facilities, and the combination of tourism is not high.
Compared with the famous self-driving route "US 66 road", the construction experience is worth borrowing.
Scenic design is no longer the most direct and fast road between origin and destination, but in accordance with the 'experience the pleasure of driving' design concept, to provide visitors from the road to enjoy the best view of the road; scenic spots can be linked to the point of view, the landscape of tourism, both retaining the historical and cultural value of tourism resources along the line, can also play a variety of the theme activities to enhance tourists' participation and experience, creating economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to scenic spots, the campground is also an important supporting facility for self-driving tours.
But there are not many visitors who choose to stay at the camping place, as reported by the Singaporean reporters.
They think that many people are biased towards infrastructure, can only meet the needs of eating, not high, products alone, can not meet the needs of self-driving this contains a lot of elements.
There is no obligation to disclose the name of the insiders said that many companies do business in the previous years in order to take place, after the land, the later supporting infrastructure construction and services do not keep up, the operation is a lot of course, and there is no future funding injection, it is difficult to do some corresponding supporting products.
Group of consumers
According to the data released in 2017 by the China Tourism Vehicle Association, from the ages, the driving group is concentrated in 21-40 years of age, especially 31-40 years of age, this part of the group has a certain economic basis, and the demand for personalized tourism is higher, and more for customers to travel.
From the accommodation check-out, the crowds who drive from the tour prefer non-standard accommodation.
From the perspective of the type of driving tour, Zhou is the most important type of driving tour, accounting for 84.32%.
Departure from the country is a long-term direction for many people, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, with the rise of consumer demand, in the past, tourists who like to drive "view spots" began to change their minds, no longer in the course of self-driving "take a picture, take a sleep on the bus", but pay more attention to the experience and process of travel.
The dinosaurs use the wardrobe to escape the enemy
At first glance, it's terrible, but it looks like a statue.
The researchers published the first study of biofossil of rhino-like, immortal, ephemeral, ephemeral, fossils discovered by the Canadian mines, pointing out that the fossils are preserved intact and therefore, experts refer to them as “Monassy in the field of dinosaurs”.
This fossil preserves very well and can even stabilize the color of its slate skin as red brown. This indicates that it has some "removal experience".
The report in the Journal of Contemporary Biology describes it as “one of the world’s best-preserved phosphores that have ever been discovered.”
The fossil is a new type of settlement that lives in the medium term of the white brass from 1.1 to 1.12 a year ago.
Its preservation status is very good, and the researchers have been shaken, and they have described it as "truly unseen".
According to the National Geographic, the grass-based phosphorus fossil is the best-preserved fossil of similar dinosaurs ever discovered.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil when mining at the Millennium Warehouse near McMuriberg, northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he met something that seems to be different from the surrounding rocks, so he decided to take a closer look.
After that, the fossils he discovered were sent to the Royal Tarir Gujo Museum in Canada.
The researchers only took 6 years to reveal this wildly exposed inside the soil inside the 2500 lb (1100 kg).
After so much work, the final result can only be published.
“If you look at it, you’ll almost always believe it’s sleeping,” said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author of the Royal Tarier Museum.
“It will be one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in scientific history – Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world.”
By researching their skins, researchers found this grassy organisms peeling, like walking tanks, but could be under significant threat from meat phosphorus.
The phosphorus of the body capillary uses red whites to avoid predators and uses a shield called "anti-blocking", a means also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that through this way, it is able to better integrate with the surrounding environment, thereby avoiding the enemy, which shows that it is predatored by larger dinosaurs.
This 1.1-year-old mob belongs to the Gentiles family, which became the first news article in May and is currently exhibited at the Royal Tarirgu Biological Museum.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who is a member of the team, carefully 7000 hours after revealing the huge picture, researchers now study it and name it “Borealopelta markmitchelli”.
Dr. Mitchell Mitchell, as well as the team of international scientists, can record the patterns and shapes of the discs and armor on them.
They found the "counter-blocking" art, which is a common defense in the animal world, which means that the back of the creature is darker than the color of its side.
Although the art of anti-blocking is common, the findings are intriguing, as the body shape of the dinosaur is far more than the existing animals that use anti-blocking.
This dinosaur face is stunned by meat food, and thus evolves in the favorable direction, so that it can hide in the dam, as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing animals, such as deer, zebras or nickel, are small and fragile like embroidery, which shows that the biological face is real to survive.
"Large heavy nail dinosaurs suffer from insane arrests, indicating how dangerous the white-lying meat dinosaurs are," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic complexes on its nipples shows that the color of the dinosaur skin is red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the organism, including the stomach contents it holds, to find out the food that was finally eating.
They believe that the dinosaurs thrust into the river when they die, then thrust into the sea, and finally sink into the sea in the way they bow down.
At that time, the weather in the province of Alberta and the climate in southern Florida today is warmer, and the rivers and oceans may be more in-depth than in the present.
Brown said: "This junction is really impressive, because it is completely covered by the preserved feminine skin, and, to this day, has been saved in the dimension so that its original shape can be saved."
"So the creature now has almost the same shape as when white brass.
You don’t need to use too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you’ll almost always believe it’s sleeping.”
The period of the white dam is a period of roaming in the Earth by a large scaret dinosaur.
Although he was the king of the dinosaurs, it did not appear for millions of years after the treacherous treacherous treacherous. The treacherous treacherous treacherous treacherous may have been arrested by some of the ancestors of the treacherous treachers.
They include a high profile, a gigantic that weighs up to 6 feet and is 38 feet long (11.5 meters).
New research has found that in the journal "Contemporary Biology" scientists believe that the end of the death to the sea, after the formation of Mummies in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, the creature was mined by Fink near McMuriberg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved phosphorus, from the nose to the hip area of the skin and armor, etc. are complete.
This biological average length is about 18 feet (5 meters) and weighs up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20 inches long, from the tip of the shoulder.
Researchers believe that this grass-fed nail dinosaurs are active in the current Canadian western region, and after the flooded rivers fall into the sea.
However, the subsea of this dinosaur burial allows it to be fully preserved.
This special sample of fossil skeletons is preserved very well, so the remaining skins still cover an inflatable piece of decks on the bones of the dinosaurs.
Like Michael Greshko in the magazine of National Geographic, the degree of preservation is like a sweeping, very rare.
The more I look at it, the more it is convincing.
The remaining fossils of skin are still covered on top of the zeal on the phosphorus bones.
Its right palm is located on its side, five feet upward.
I can count its piece of deck.”
I learned that the addition of seaweed acid, rotten acid, and amino acid additives of natural or plant sources into the urinary production process can be modified and effective, the formation of seaweed acid uric acid uric acid, erosine, eurine tyrene urinary nitrogen utilization of ordinary urinary uretic can be increased by 5 to 10 percent.
Environmentally friendly, the cultivation potential of crops, especially large grain value-added urea is a high-quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
The total number of security guards was twice as many as the number of security guards at the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest ever security federation program.
Previously, the Brazilian government stated that a total of 8.5 million people from the army and police will work together on wars, including 2 million prisoners and 6.5 million police officers.
The majority of the new 3000 men will be protected by the International Airport, the metro station and the street.
Police officers cruise elsewhere in the city, including metro, transit and streets.
It is reported that there are currently 6000 people arriving at Rio to provide security services for the Olympic Games.
In addition to the four races of the Rio Olympics, they also take a tour of the airport and the main roads of the connecting airport and the stadium.
The introduction of the evaluation mechanism in the service industry has long been not a new thing, in order to make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make the monitoring more effective and not flow in form.
How do radicals learn to answer this question: "Who is the street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrerner's heart was confused.
On the first day of your trip to New York City, the St. Louis man sits on his bedding and browses the web on his phone.
She stumbled on a post for a high school student.
The above states that "the policeman kills a 18-year-old child, and the child lying on the street."
She found that no one else posted this message on the feed, and she felt confused. She turned on Twitter about the Internet.
One @TheePharoah user keeps pushing her the dynamic newsletter.
The St. Louis region's vocalist live Twitter broadcaster Michael Brown's death. Michael Brown, a 18-year-old black uncraved weapon, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
A picture of the body lying on the street with Brown losing his life. His body lying on the street for four hours.
"I'm sucked," Ferrer thought.
But to her and her community, death is not something new.
She dropped her phone until it opened again in the evening, and read about tweets gathered by the great Canfield Avenuens.
There are police records and shouting pictures of people, and there is also a picture of someone who claims to be the father of Brown, saying: "Fegson police smother died my handless son!"
She saw a live feed that a police officer used to stand in front of a group of protesters with a dog.
She said, in another video, another police officer screamed at his steps: "I will kill all of you... livestock."
"It's not normal," Ferrer said when he returned.
“It’s not a typical crocodile event that we thought we were a regular, arguably typical.”
At that moment, I felt cold and hanged.
I'm angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
11 pm After a while, she took the 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would travel to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary "The Streets?" that was released in theaters on August 11.
This is a story of people who are asked to get answers from the perspective of living in this community, building blocks, and telling about survival and resistance, love and loss, strength, and pitfalls.
When Ferrer and her sons (weared with flower skirts, with crowned mates) drive to Ferguson, two people revisited the endless number of questions that they talked about before that morning -- "About Black Experiences and Black Facts".
“Do you remember when I taught you when black had to fight for your faith?” she replied.
“We are going to Ferguson now, because the police died a 18-year-old boy, it was not right.
I had to bring her,” Ferrer later said.
“What happens today is the climax of all things in the past....
She knows, sees, and rises from that matter.
Not only do she need to develop well in the field of radicalism and organization, but she wants to understand the different aspects of black experience and the situation of black, to understand what we must do in order to gain freedom and liberation.
Even though I was fortunate to offer her a racist experience that she had not experienced as herself, she has nothing different from another black girl.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel that I am harming her.”
They arrived at the first stop of Ferguson at a site opposite the police station in South Florida.
Ferrer and her daughter are connected with a local business boss making bags and lunch.
They have prepared a bag to carry the bag to the defeater.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new kind of activism.
She said, “My radicals changed at the end of August 9th.” When she was reading the undergraduate at the University of Missouri, she was the chairman of the Minority Nurses Association, focusing on the issues of eating positive and health disparities in the Black community.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's all that."
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with film director Sabakh Fuller during a night parade.
Flare tells what happened to her and her film director Lucas Alvarado Faller "just wanting to record".
A question emerged in the sea of Ferrer: "Did you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This skeptical comes from a lot of such cases: people - usually white - into a community to benefit from its pain and pitfalls.
As Fürreich explained in the most recent survey, “We hear that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not concentrate on their voice, and we wanted to do it in a different way.”
Flashed has been connected with Diamond Davis, the co-director of a region-wide artist known for his passion for the deceased prisoner.
His involvement led Ferrer and six other locals to join the “The Street?” project team, which had been indistinguishable for years after the collapse of Brown.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks to us or speaks with us, it's our message." Davis said.
"I mainly focus on how these characters are presented, because this is the way I am presented."
Although the goal is not to focus on the experience of Ferrer – but to show that the movement is "not about the leaders of the Savior, but about the cohesion of the community", Flalah said – to prove that she is the most open to movie participants.
As a result, “Who’s the street?” is a daunting record of Ferrer’s personal life, such as getting into the river and getting into marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrer laughed for the first time he saw the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this work and humanizing Black people must have a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrer’s story reaffirms and re-positions the role of black, cool women in the broader Black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the sport -- created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 Black Teen Trevor Martin's Pantry case -- is identified as cool.
“Black, cool women in the leadership stand up on this movement,” Ferrer said, “that’s because we’re fighting on multiple battles online.”
Black, cool women must bear all of this.”
Flay conceived and mentioned "the movement was really supported by black women and many black cool women."
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the core of the video. However, she called "it's not a sure action for things."
“She is the one who stimulates this energy,” she said.
"Aply she's on the front line, but it's not coincidental. Because in these crossroads of life, as a black, cool woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the curtain, you can feel her energy.”
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, the news filmmaker has disappeared, but the racist relationship between the community and the police remains.
Ferrer is sentenced to two and a half years’ imprisonment due to a pilot sealing of the highway during a parade.
She describes the social and political atmosphere in the area she calls home: "Awful."
Nevertheless, she has been holding her own efforts to cry out the holy songs since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"We have responsibility for fighting for freedom.
We have the responsibility to win the profit.
We must love each other to support each other.
We will no longer be lost, except the shame of the body.”
In fact, a decade ago on the network has provided online translation services, but in fact, a long time ago, the discussion about "the machine is about to replace the human translation" is not tied to the ears.
Similar to: Artists Use Chelsea Manning's DNA to Create a Portrait
There are many faces in the center of the gallery: white, black, and brown, and there are almost all sorts of similarities between each face, which are lined down from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by art artist Heather? Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea? Manton sent to her parlors and hair debris.
Man is sent from the Livorwsburg archery for 35 years in prison due to the disclosure of confidential diplomatic telegraphs through the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition will open on August 2nd with the title "similar".
The results of the communication between Hamburg and Manchester, Duwei? Hagerburg combines its discipline with her own technical, computer science and art, while Mante is a well-known different politician, who had entered the law, and completed a transformative operation in the arch. Former President of the United States Obama three days before the end of her term of office, forgiven her remaining prison.
Through the algorithm analysis of the DNA from Mante, and in order to create a 30 portrait of "the appearance that is likely to appear", Heather Duve Habbog made a sharp and unbelievable comment. His comment was both for the versatility of the DNA and for the concept of identity itself.
The man's birth name was Bradley Edward, who publicly acknowledged that he was a woman in adolescence. In 2013 he was convicted and involved 20 allegations, including 6 spying practices, computer deception, and abusive guilt.
In the arch, her image is suppressed, only a bunch of photos, black and white selfie with grain sense, looking shining uneasy, sitting on the dock, wearing a silver ointment.
In 2015, Heather Duway Hagorg made great success in her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In that work, she created a portrait of a 3D person who could be similar to that of a long-phase, using the DNA extracted from chrylic and chewing intermediate court artifacts.
That’s what she just received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They want to take Chelsea Mannon in the siege of the siege and need a portrait of him,” he said at the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea Mannon was unable to visit and could not take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she had interested in making a DNA portrait.
So, the artist and her sons-in-law became impossible friends, and exchanged many letters with each other for two years.
They even created a comic book, > by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book prescribing president will be able to give permission to Man, she can see the exhibition in the arsenal.
And Obama was just a few days after the book was published asking her to be won. This may be a coincidence, when Man spent the seventh year just in the Kansas military prison.
In addition, this exhibition also has another deep understanding. Because of the contemporary United States, the Trump administration constantly declared war on the government’s decrees and diabolics, while looking for new, hype-possessing ways to nakedly incite divisions, and this exhibition is about to unite in this divisive division.
When asked about all these special occasions, Hassle-Daughter Habbog said, "There is a reason for anything."
In the artist’s statement above the gallery, the grand number of Manchester is called below (the name of the “i” is drawn out with a heart), calling for the end of the “gender, sexual orientation and culture based on the image of the party.”
Faced with her mitochondrial DNA sequence, it distorted with a twist on Cs, Gs, and As symbols.
Through a scientific dictionary containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist’s complexity), Heather Duweh Haborg hopes to show these surprisingly similar portraits by portraying at least in the physical structure, everyone is.
"I want people to scare this dilemma, our gene group will not care about who we are, how the open genetic data is interpreted, what kind of the main view it is '," Heather Duway Harbog said, his 2007 video work "false memory" was also on display.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so it’s 30 of them.”
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, from the front illustration in the small one.
The Man in which the soldiers in the United States handheld acquaintance under the whistle.
“When they stop your speech, they win ” and bow down.
“So, thousands don’t forget.”
“These content comes directly from a letter from her to me,” said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm afraid again, I'm still going to say it." 」
Man has not seen this exhibition from her own DNA portrait mask, just like a group of protesters have cheered at the center of the exhibition.
This is also the purpose, as all the items in the exhibition, have reached the height of the message of the single multiplier (5.2 ft, the height of the man) that she wrote with the iron.
“In the past, I have brought them to the wall, but I want them to feel like a group of people,” said Dr. Duway?
“But I wanted to make them feel like a group of protesters who were with Chelsea, just as they wanted to release her.”

Russia’s vice president, Muteko, said, “We will be accomplishing the map of the world’s opposition map in the near future.”
Vitali Muteko, Vice President of Russia, said the remaining criteria for implementing the World Counterparty Agency (WADA) would not take longer to revive the rights of Russia’s Counterparty Agency (RUSADA).
“The road map standard has been developed to a certain stage, and RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD (British Counterparty Agency).
The WADA route map was updated in this regard, “Muteco Thursday said.
The above statement was made by Deputy Prime Minister Muteco when the review of the second part of the map of the world’s anti-aggressive bodies, Compliance Rules. The section sets the criteria for restoring the rights of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Muteko, nothing in the standard is likely to cause Russia.
He added, “Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
And will submit the results to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that Russian opposition agencies must openly accept the findings of the WADA-approved investigation of the Russian state's support for the use of rapture in the national sports.
“We are investigating that there is no doubt that our anti-terrorist system has been wronged,” said Mutke.
All measures have been implemented.
But this does not exist behind the state plan, and we will not admit anything that does not exist.
Mr. Muteko’s words responded to the words of the Russian independent public opposition committee, Vitali Smilnov.
The Russian outlet RSport interviewed Russia’s antitrust agencies in the past, but he added: “We have repeatedly spoken in various venues, and the report contains a stance and determination.
No one has plans to accept this report without conditions, “Smilnov said.
In November 2015, the WADA suspended the RUSADA’s rights to engage in rushing inspections in Russia.
But in June of this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and test under the supervision of international experts and UKAD this year.
When WADA’s director, Olivia Nigel, visited the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, RUSADA was “forward in the right direction” and endeavored to restore its rights.

According to the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), about half of the items sold last year were returned.
In addition, there are readers many times the explosion of online shopping has been blocked, and consumers need more attention when shopping on non-formal websites.

Once you know what has been done, apply for a refund from the website, so you can get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe that the site refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Northern California Chinese resident, said he had two times purchased an expedited delivery service for a website, an expedited service of four yuan, but neither of them was delivered on time.

The ultimate shopping experience, the new era of shopping and development of the mall
More than a decade ago, China is in the market as a whole, people have limited choice, and demand is limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has already realized from the side of the market to the buyer of the market changes, today's consumer tastes become more, they are no longer simplistic "one hand hand to pay one hand" shopping behavior.
Therefore, how to get consumers a great shopping experience to become the next competitive point for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the shopping experience of consumers, the shopping center in the mall is the most important.
See how city builders around the world focus on shopping experiences.
There are no two parts in the world that are completely the same, and none of them are the one-of-a-kind shopping center, and a famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Kanyon shopping center in Turkey, its unique wave-shaped architecture is inspired by the Canyon, so the loud Kanyon, which walks through the 200-metre walkway in the central Kanyon neighborhood.
In addition to its valley-style design, in the center of the shopping center, there is also a large, facade-shaped venue, unique form and often featured performances.
Because of the open platform design, so that tourists to walk in every floor can overlook the activities carried out in the "Graduate", with the effect of moving landscapes.
In addition, the Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, which is the first forest-style walk-through of China, combines shopping with living, fairy tales perfectly.
7000 square meters of green water square, 3000 square meters of water platform, the project consists of 9 separate buildings, the air corridor between the buildings, the entire settlement courtyard design, drawing the top French compartment for the architectural leather, roof of the rooftop waters, to create a forest-like feeling.
Go into the forest moles, like accidentally fall into the rabbit hole in Alice's roaming wonders, climb along the dry will build the garden, the grass, the spring mirror, the people into a full living organ and the vitality of the forest.
There are also in the heavy lifting, the Qia Jiaquan Group built by Long Lake, plan a hundred sides of the business, plan to introduce more than 50 international flagship stores, more than 100 international brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign well-known brands, to create a service industry gathering, the theme of the distinctive business center.
Not only that, the Jiaquan Group will also integrate life into the building, with TOD public transport as the guide, focusing on fashion shopping, living services, dining, entertainment, education, sports in one, while also guiding them to enjoy repetition and unique "water culture", shopping and water entertainment, leisure and perfect integration.
In summary, we can find that at present, some of the housing companies have insight into the discovery of this new urban business, and industry people said that this consumer experience as the center, how to combine shopping and experience the consumption model will be the mainstream of future urban development.
Now the business circle is not only a scattered place of goods, more is a combination of art and culture, creative theme, but also bear the people's responsibility for urban living.
Therefore, to meet the needs of consumers to eat and drink to play one-stop shopping at the same time, to maximize the cultural and cultural arts multi-level spiritual needs, to play a livable living needs, is bound to be the future development of the business circle system high point.
In rejuvenation, the north shore of the country, Jiangshan, in the region of Jiangbei, close to the sound, the world's premier business, the international giants around the ring, the first-class brand can be gathered, close to the distance with international fashion.
It is here to walk through the glorious and robbing of the world’s best.
East Plains retailing has a good shopping environment, East Plains retailing close to the Nanping business district, exclusive to the West and even the nation's leading four-storey transport system, improved shopping comfort.
In addition, the construction road and Wanda Plaza two walking streets of landscaped park, landscaped site of improving upgrade, planting about 300 trees, transformation of the site of 40,000 square meters, to enhance the image of the Nanping business circle;
And Lake Hu No. 1, close to the first low-density water supply business circle - Jiaquan Water business circle, surrounded by nine parks, commercial street density is low, open level is high, making people more willing to stop when shopping, footing, slowly enjoy shopping, rather than being dragged by the people flowing in the back is eager to move forward, truly "walking shopping."
Today's business competitiveness will only become more and more intense, how to beat a bloodroad in the highly assimilated market, to win the beauty of future consumers in the heart of the "shopping destination", worthy of all real estate developers to seriously think.
The only single differentiation strategy is remote, only those who really put consumers in the heart, the urgent consumers, want consumers to think, to provide consumers with the ultimate and simple shopping experience developers to laugh in the market of the storm.
Of course, by the end I think the highest of the people is heavy, have such a good shopping experience and business circle, put 10 years ago, no one can imagine today's prosperity.
Festivals: Consumerism is fanatic about the real price of the environment
1682 Wan Yuan, this is the November 11, 2017, "Ten Hu Hu Xia Eleven Global Carnival" within 24 hours, the customer of Ten Hu.
Specifically, after the opening of the 'two 11', a short 3-minute sky cat deal will break 100 million, 6 minutes 05 seconds more than 200 million yuan, 9 hours to break 1000 million.
On this day, the total number of payments made by global consumers was 14.8 million, an increase of 41% from last year.
These consumptions will bring 8.12 million logistics orders.
Whether it’s the TEN grid buying platform or the payment gateway, it’s all part of the Ali Group in Mayun.
Ten years ago, no one would think, November 11 alone young people out of their own creation of the "lightland festival" subculture will be collected by the electricity supplier, become the present phenomenon level of the "double 11" shopping fanatic festival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba's first use of the "Raysong Festival Promotions" marketing header: no one loved you, then "single dog" come to buy online.
The results are surprising, the day Taobao Mall ("Ten-Chen" predecessor) trading broke 5200 million yuan, which is 10 times the daily trading amount at the time.
From this point of view, "double 11" has become Alibaba's shopping fanatic festival, from the beginning of domestic buyers to self-confident, to the start of the global business, nine years ago, the cat "double 11" thousand transactions have been 3200 times of the year, making the "Black Friday" look like nothing.
With the storm of the "Eleven Double" promotion, there are also many electricity providers, including the "Jindong" is the most powerful.
"Jongdong" has its own shopping festival "6.18", but there is no "double 11" effect, this year from November 1 to 11, "Jongdong" cumulative sales reached 1271 million yuan.
And after the "squad 11", it followed by the "squad 12" with similar fracturing fanatic, Christmas New Year shopping period.
After the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers to have the annual shopping period before the Spring Festival, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, no holidays.
Immediate mass consumption of environmental issues has attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua daily telegram, according to the industry's usual standard of each box 0.2 kg conservative estimate, this year's 'two 11' period generated at least more than 30 million garbage.
The pollution control project director of the Greenpeace East Asia Division discussed the foreign dialogue, this year's 'second 11' only sky cat orders will produce 16 million packaging waste.
The National Postal Administration issued a report in 2016, indicating that the 2015 'second 11' period (11 to 16 November) of the shipment amount of about 7.8 pieces, using more than 30 lines of packaging bags, 99.22 pieces of packaging, 169.85 rice belts, the length of the belt can be carried to Earth equatorial 425 spheres.
And this year, the National Post Office is expected to 'double 11' the shipment business volume forecast more than 15 pieces.
Mr. Wang, the manager of a garbage stupid center in Beijing, told the Xinhua agency, “11 double” of the daily intake of more than 2000 waste, but also exceeds the processing capacity of the stupid station.
The company has noticed that environmental pollution caused by the fast industry is not discreet.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suo, 'double 11' before the introduction of recyclable plastic express boxes, can be reused as bag and garbage bag loop packaging bags, etc., but the suspicion of numb consumer acceptance is not high.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in the microblogging.
This microblogging received more than 68000 "comments".

For the globalization of mobile payments in China, Arrow Consulting 'China third-party mobile payment industry research report 2017' is summarized in two types: First, through strategic investment, experience out of stock and support foreign domestic mobile payment enterprises.
Second, through the consumption of Chinese tourists, to promote mobile payment services to foreign businesses, and thus to change the foreign domestic awareness and acceptance of China's mobile payment.
Indeed, the Chinese have the world.
The rapid development of China's economy, coupled with the population base, Chinese tourists in Europe are a number of people.
But this is also destined that the China Mobile Payment War in Germany is not anticipating.
Wechat pay and pay your baby but move the battlefield to Europe, the rivals are no change, the sweeping lands are still constant - or the Chinese, which is also globalization?
More pioneering exploration is that China’s mobile payment can be expanded in Europe?
Take Germany as an example.
"New Retail" with magic cast
As Amazon announced at the top ten retailers in the world, it was a great opportunity to play at the same time as the company's leading bookstores and lockers.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two home booksstores in Portland and San Diego.
In 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost the same time, Amazon has announced that its Amazon Go pilot operation, customers do not need to queue up to the store, and does not need to close, door code, get the desired goods away, the shopping gold will be automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it has been an unexpected thing that almost a few years have suddenly worked on a physical store.
Because as early as 2007 >, CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized that Amazon would not easily open physical stores, unless the following four conditions are met:
We must be sure that this new opportunity to make the shareholder's investment return;
We must be sure that this new opportunity has a great significance for the entire company;

The other side of the Earth also hears a similar sound. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunyun General Assembly, the chairman of Alibaba Group’s board of directors, Mahyun, gave a keynote speech.
He said: “Since next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the phrase ‘e-commerce’.
The era of e-commerce will soon end, the next decade and 20 years will not have e-commerce, instead of the 'new retail'.
“Off-line and logistics combined to generate new retail.”
At a time, the "new retail" three words as magic was cast, by the industry people in the mouth of the frequency.
But what does “new retail” mean?
If only refers to the combination of online and offline, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest e-commerce after the estimated total e-commerce sales of approximately $2000, and 25 of them accounted for more than $1590.
Of these 25, 18 of them are traditional retailers on the line that have only started their business in the last five years (e.g., Massey hundred, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
Alibaba Group 283 million dollars into the company, but also experienced the purpose.
From a global perspective, retailers and e-commerce are shifting to omnichannel retail systems that cover physical stores, e-commerce, mobile and social media from a single channel.
“New Retail”, more is a summary rather than a future outlook?
If not, what exactly is the difference between the omni-channel concept and the “new retail”?
Or, the key to the question is not that online and offline will not be integrated, but how to integrate.
Looking back to the past 20 years of the retail industry, the rise of e-commerce as the rise of early-stage discount retailers, are focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, the e-commerce standardization very high degree of products, such as books and CDs, moved offline online.
With the continuous improvement of online consumption and customer experience, e-commerce has also reached other categories and started to improve efficiency.
With Alibaba CEO the courage to say, 'the use of Internet thinking and technology to comprehensively reform and upgrade the total number of existing about 30 million social retailers, so that Chinese consumers increasingly upgraded consumer demand can be effectively met, making the entire commodity production, circulation, service process because of the Internet, the widespread use of big data becomes more efficient. '
Therefore, the road of electricity supplier, is a surface asset, the road of real assets.
'light', refers to fixed assets, staffing, management processes and other major lack of traditional retail industry; 'heavy', refers to the logistics, distribution and other aspects of the need for huge investment.
The change in the logistics method ensures the efficiency of e-commerce.

Central attention and pointed out that it can play the role of the Internet in the promotion of attacks, and promote the precision of the support, precision, so that the product through the Internet out of the village. 」
As early as 2014, Ali proposed the village strategy, with big data cloud computing and globalization as the three core strategies of Ali in the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the village Taobao (Village Tao) project, recruited 'Village 2' in the village, lead the farmers to get rich by e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali cooperated with the business sector to create a favored channel, currently accumulating the national 13 provinces, 120 national barriers.

Among them, village Tao is the main loading platform of Ali's e-commerce, and has been through a direct Internet chain of new ways.

Ali opened an e-commerce course through Taobao University, to grant standardization to the farmers, quality and size of planting methods, to achieve the 'supporting + supporting mind' combined, so that the farmers can continue the process.
These courses have already covered about 92% of the state-level helpers.
And 'public interest heart, business means' of the idea, can also protect Ali in the support of the 'real help'.
Jack Ma, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alibaba, said that it should be divided into three stages of support, devotion, and wealth.
The fist is to give a fish, the fist is to give a fish, and to get rich is to create a "seed" for the furry of the furry people, so that the furry people have a fish.

Help you avoid a company as the next good start-up
Amy Eret once wanted to investigate the happiness of her employees at her e-commerce startup, but did not do anything.
Getting responses is often utterly unknown, unhelpful, and even worse, there are deceptive responses.
Even though she promises to adopt an anonymous form, some employees still do not trust the process.
Mason Reed, a 75-person San Francisco e-commerce haircare company, said that "the lack of consistency and observance of getting responses."
So she calls for help.
A number of new human resources start-up companies such as the rain and spring to appear, to help the company understand the feelings of employees.
They build and authorize software specifically used to measure employee engagement, which allows companies to quickly conduct public awareness tests on specific teams and demographics, provide employees with anonymity and feedback thread, and in some cases allow reporters to have a direct report to the Board of Directors.
“Now you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company’s Fitbit?” said Jim Bennett, co-founder and chief executive officer of Redwood City startup Glint. Glint’s software analysis tool is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Within three years, Eret said she used Glint to get more insights on employees’ ideas and feelings.
In addition to the quick and polls of specific teams, Glint also offers company buzzes, which units have the most inputs and which managers have low approval scores at a glance – this gives her an in-depth look at why.
Companies began to realize that they had to be familiar with the company's culture of the workplace, so as not to become the next step. Prior to the steps, employees published a blog post describing the stupid environment, these spokespersons were stolen by the company, and then the steps fell in a mess.
For start-up companies like Glint, the company's vision is a moneyless business.
According to data from Let's Talk Payments, a financial technology analysis site, the value of the global governance, regulatory, and compliance industry could be more than $1,187 million by 2020.
Denver, Colorado’s start-up, Convercent, is dedicated to helping companies prevent and discover bad behavior, and they saw an increase in interest and activity in this area during the time of the collapse earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Tiny and Tesla.
Step recently agreed to be a customer.
As with Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “explained” surveys, collect confidential responses in real-time, and view hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides an anonymous text message line that allows employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman of the board of directors is heard, then the investment will be directly into the board of directors.
Patrick Kran, founder and chief executive of Convercent, said: "The argument that the Court of Justice wielded the authority of the regulatory body.
If a company is found to be poorly treated with employees or behave unethically against employees, even if the regulatory agency does not intervene, the company may also face high consequences of consumer boycotts, employee churn, and concluding conversations, Queensland says.
Ruby Tuesday is a restaurant store that spans more than 500 locations and has more than 25,000 employees. It has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees understand the work guidelines and work procedures, providing easy access to the company’s headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report the problem, must find the company's head office phone number or email address, put forward a formal comment, and hope that the head office can treat this seriously.
This is often a terrifying and uneasy experience, and Ruby Tuesday’s legal director asked James Wittrano as he said, he thought there was no good way to track employee input.
But now, using Convercent, the company can discover and solve problems previously not known to executives at remote offices, cities, or states – such as discrimination, embarrassment, or unfair wage behavior.
“I can get to know the work experience more closely and 360 degrees,” said Weitrano, the managing team at Ruby Tuesday.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment.”
According to Queensland, after a sudden fall in the firm of Andoral accounting firms, companies have been paying more attention to ethics, values, and employee engagement since 2002.
But not until “social media enters their world,” companies are conscious that they can’t stop their explosions from spreading online.
“Before using technical monitoring ethics, people saw hope as a strategy,” he said.
Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge each company a recurring fee for the use of the product.
This business model and business opportunities are backed by risk investors who have provided support to the two startups.
In February, Convercent gathered $1000 million in capital from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, whose total capital rose to $4700 million.
In November, Glint received $1000 from Bessemer Venture Partners with a total of $6000.
The correlation between companies, culture, and risk investments is hardly confusing.
More and more studies have shown that today’s employee expectations for workplaces are higher than before.
In a highly competitive market like Silicon Valley, high paychecks and interesting projects are only bet.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, that they spend their time in a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voice is listened to, the work they do is beneficial, and they are more committed to making the company successful,” said Nina McCartney, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn. LinkedIn also uses Convercent and Glint, two softwares.
Investors in their portfolios perform well in a timely manner to achieve returns; the company performs well in staff loyalty and dedication.
If third-party analytics tools commit to increasing employee loyalty and engagement, it’s no wonder they’ll look for financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it’s important to keep track of employee engagement data.
However, these data are no longer available unless the company’s administrator takes action.
In fact, if a company asks employees to provide feedback, it can be expected that the company is undergoing changes.
If the change progress is not fast enough, or there is no progress, it may be disappointed and result in employees leaving the company.
"If you want to read the 4000 recommendations, you need to be ready for 4000 conversations," said Russell Rase, Head of Consulting Business at Kotter International, a business management company. "He has seen some mistakes that some companies collect excessively dependent data.
"Because if you don't follow up all the way, the staff would think, 'Do you really hear what I said?
What do you care about?
If you don’t care, why should I care?’”
Eret said Madison Reed is now conducting monthly employee surveys and has been able to take action on the day Glint reported the issue.
After collecting feedback from employees about the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she will be able to solve the problem by re-engineering the company's internal team, increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new insights from its employees, and from the long-term, they want to be able to make changes in this industry, known for its high turnover rate, to better retain employees.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’re losing talent,” Vitrano says.
“If you lose your talent, you will lose your customers.
And when you lose your customers, you will lose your company.”

NCAA eliminates two daily exercises (targeted to undo player squeezes), but actually extends their daytime training time - at least by the end of Friday.
This is why the first three training sessions at the University of California, Los Angeles are scheduled to start at 7 p.m. 15 p.m. in order to accommodate the schedule that the player has been clogging.
From canceling two trainings a day to more one day for training, the bear team began training almost one week before the last season, Mora spent the first time in summer school in Westwood during the six seasons.
They plan to have 18 trainings starting August 20, and then start preparing for the official tournament for the first time of September's war with Texas laborers.

“In three or four days, we will give them a huge amount of training, very challenging,” said Mora.

I think Saturday, we will have more time, really great.”
At the end of the sequel, the University of California, Los Angeles, will stop training. Take a look at the nearby parking lot and the clear vision of Luskin Center, which is not an easy task.
From this weekend, the Bears Team will stay in the hotel. But Mora acknowledges that problems may arise once these rooms are vacant in the middle of the season.
“We will take security measures,” Mora said.
“It’s a really exciting question. It doesn’t think someone might be renting a room, sitting in a room for a training scene, and the idea isn’t strong.
If you have a training video tape, it is also pretty good.
But we will take security measures there, and at the parking lot 8 we will also take security measures.
We will use existing resources to do the best.
For this, I won't be too bored.
We’ve made a plan.”

This is not the first book in Lodz to use a critic as a raw material: He also wrote the 2014 Dead Teeth and other stories, which is a book written by the English Library liberally, a work that he was inspired and completed by uncontrollable creative passion.
He said: "I'm seeing the thumbs I left behind in the letter at the beginning of the moment, and I can't suppress my own writings to move, the letter is a heavy agent who worked for Jacob in the 18th century."
"That's his finger!
And the letter has been sluggish, because at that time, you need to light on the fire.
For us 300 years later, this flavor makes people feel like they are also in us.
Oh, I like the Archives article!
For those who have been beaten by the old ones, they can get the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and live in the castle for nearly four months (say, I have been a little longer) It seems that it is great, and simply don’t believe it is true.
Lodz spends days browsing Victoria's "new" castles, flipping the archives, studying the many treasures and ancient play of the garden, such as the dog heads on the wall, as well as spending a few centuries of bottles on the River of Suilla and much more.
He walks through the land and walls of the old castle, chatting with the Wanderer, Gardener, and sometimes with the drawing illustration artist in his book.
Then in the evening, he would "drink a whisky, and then write."
The secret history of Scotty is not clear, as the National Trust only enters completely after the death of Elizabeth Hessi, the last successor of the British National Trust in 2006.
Ten years later, when Lodz arrived, the staff began to deal with the project, they described it as "the hundreds of years ago tribes have to go: "Oh, put it in the midst of the mud'."
Nizhny, letters from the British Empire era, depicting various countries in the land territory of the map: "You will think that the land will be very boring", Roth said, "but two families will occur for the sake of a white bath.
Let's let go, the guys!"
Some of the stories in this work take the castle as a starting point, and then look at the UK’s history more extensively, including The Labourer, which takes the lead of a person who left the newly built castle to join the 1381-year-old populace.
The story of “Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,” recorded a rape that took place in the castle in 1380, says Lotz.
“The folk ups began in that area, and I think there is a great place to start.
Does it mean that these two people are associated?
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which describes the seven-year-old story of a Jesuit pastor in the period of British religious reform.
Or The Smuggler, the master of the story is Arthur, the 18th-century smuggling smugglingman? Darel, who is considered to have funeral on his own by decorating his squirts with quartz (they were exposed to the ground in a few years before the people were heard).
The Darrells is Lodz's favorite Scotty Castle family: "These gentlemen seem to be endless, always have to borrow money, and then spend money on what they can't afford."
Generations of Darel men by married to rich old women to solve their debt problem, I think they should be a group of handsome guy, know how to pursue women. 」
At the end of his mission in the castle, Lodz began to search for other miracles.
He completed a sketch in two weeks in the wilderness of Finland with the content of "El? ¤m?¤nm?¤ki", which was a 20th century early spa, and later it was slowly dropped out.
But Scottine has a special status for him.
"I left with my heart," he said.
"It's like: 'Oh, I have to face the real life of the cake.'"

sex robot is just on the rise, but we should be careful
Just as you saw it in 2017, the field of sex robots released a new technical development report.
Yes.
Now sex robot can be a big thing.
Recently, the FRR has released a report looking forward to the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Mr. Shakey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence, retired and co-founder of FRR, at the University of Sheffield, we need to start really treating sex robots.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, lactose shape and nail type.
Shaykey said in the new report: "People laugh at the back, but the major companies do launch a lot of sexy robots, and we will see more." 」
Modern love doll has evolved from inflatable doll to a robot, they have a monolithic skin, feel warm, and specially use artificial intelligence to set human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also “custom” their robots to suit their preferences, from the color of their eyes, to the shape of their breasts to the nail type or the color.
But more disturbing is that a lot of robots with "personality" will make "copying wife" look very advanced.
The modern love toy has evolved into a robot with a tincture skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot can be defined based on the characteristics that the user thinks attractive, such as shy.
There are also Rodxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which can pre-set character characteristics, including "cold frella" with a bit of shaky and "lave of adventure" "alpine vinyl".
“Roxxxy Gold robot has the personality that may be similar to you,” the True Companion company website for this Tsuda.
So she loves you and is yours.
She also had little feelings with normal people in that day!
She can be generous and can be healthy or ‘sexual’!”
The rise of sex robots brings a lot of insanity – not only to replace the real human relationship – but also to the feminine characteristics of the knees and the strong hints of pulling up the Faraches (distortion: resistance) are the most exciting.
True Companion compares Roxxxy to the vibrator of a man on its website.
The website says "If a woman has a stick, why can't men have Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not a pure object, they are not just a sex toy.
Their appearance and their growing maturity are the darker and deeper parts of our culture: from perfect sex equality to the sex love of the additional options of obedience.
Of course, most men do not leave sexy robots, and probably FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more and more popular, but they are still in the midst of consumer culture at the moment.
But what has been so popular that we can see the process of this era where we are.
Many people don’t seem to be aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to become so.
These sophisticated sex robots appear in a global women's right by threat era, White House also has a president who is bragging for sexual violence against women, which is not coincidence.
The most cold part of television "The story of making women" is not in realistic drawing, not in that very quiet body, not in that one double was digging out of the eyes, but in that one is divided into the real imagination.
Keyle Republic is a jump, but it doesn’t look good now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to use technology to create bodies that are most like real women (and maybe by the proportion of porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human views and imitate real human movements.
But in straight language, their "personality" does not represent real women.
They can’t break up, and they can’t go out.
They do not have a turn and no follow-up story, no independence, and no fantasies that could break the bottom of the slavery.
In her words, they are the slaves of love.
Or according to the common law of 2017: make a woman.

Trump’s Great Success?
Mitt Romney as the shadow of common sense
Political differences bring the dividing of American voters, and from a microscopic point of view, break down the American family and cheer. This is no stranger to the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major U.S. newspapers were filled with how to deal with Trump’s fears of voting.
It is usually believed that we are making every effort to break through our "suffocation foam".
Less commented about the power Trump brings together his family.
I mentioned this because my sister, a left-wing thief living in Chicago, he was unable to live with the Republicans in our house for a long time, and this week he came to New York to worship me.
She reminds me that the fight against the common enemy can produce powerful results.
As a result of working with Trump in the White House, all the people she met, even including those who have been politically rallying for decades, are now suddenly and strangely standing on the same line.
If you are at the table, it is certainly a good thing. But let me feel shaking is that from a more extensive point of view, it will cause significant risk.
Although the left-wing figure has been saddened by Trump, but the curvature effect that he brought to the President of his reign has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the possibility of extinction, that is, his quirky behavior may be stopped one day.
However, there is also a more exciting long-term scene, Trump to 'normalization' is the relationship with the right-wing republican, these republican people have opposed Mr. President's criteria, now suddenly seems a symbol of rationality.
I found a little obsessed with the recent madness of the Romney version: bringing the dog on the car, 14% of the income tax (but at least we know his tax return), which seems to be too tiny for the two of the offences that are driven compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate only needs to be intelligently qualified to make immeasurable improvements.
When my cathedral sister lives on town, we take the child to the New York Park spin-to-marma, which is the largest spin-to-marma operated by the New York Central Park administration, and if you don't need the words of coffee, these three-dollar tickets are the most consumable value for you in this city.

35 years later, I haven't forgotten completely that day, and I found that "Swiss Cottage" is not actually a Swiss Cottage, but it's a spot in the theme bar "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage", I'm not sure, but near a intersection in north London.

If I could rate the carousel, I would give it a score, but fortunately no one asked it.
But this week in a department store, before brushing credit cards, I was asked to rate my transaction "experience" one to five star rating.
In the coffee shop in the corner of my street, as well, in addition, you can choose to rate with 15% tip, which is in order to buy something on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to reduce the speed that should have been a neutral transaction, but also to bring the staff pressure to add personal factors to the unwanted scenario.
The obsolete woman in this department store apologized to laugh, and I was tired, and the credit card transaction experience showed her five-star.

Does lean meat, dairy and chocolate contribute to the relief of inflammatory atrophy (IBD)?
But meat and chocolate may sound like your digestive system's cradle.
But a new study shows exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve the associated symptoms of inflammatory atrophy patients.
The symptoms of this disorder have affected about 130 million Americans and about 30 million British people, resulting in stomach and abdominal, frequent or hemorrhoid stomach, weight loss and fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington often recommend that patients avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers find the key amino acids - tyrosine of proteins that help to promote immune cell growth, which can increase the endurance of the limbs.
Dr. Marco Colonna explains that immune cells will be patrolled in the limbs to ensure that the harmful microorganisms hidden in food are not kept secretly in the body.
Maintain a balanced balance between inflammatory cells and aggressive tolerant cells, protecting the body from all sorts of sensitive and fragile tissues.
An inflammation can occur when a balanced state is too biased to inflammation.
Discover a cell that promotes immunity in a rat with special germs.
Bacteria require the appearance of cysine (one of the components of proteins) to form the cells.
Professor Colonna said, “We have established a connection between a germ group (the normal part of the botanical microbiome) and the development of resistant cell groups.
The more styryine a mouse is in the diet, the more immune cells they have.
He advises that if humans use the same method, that is, the combination of lactosis and styryine rich diets may create a more resilient, less inflammatory tract environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, Postdoctoral Fellow, studied an immune cell that could increase immunity when she found that a group of mice had this kind of cell, but another group of homogeneous strains had not been separated.
She has doubted that this different kind of paralytic microbes (meaning bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the stomach tract) are related to the population.
The DNA sequence of rats for steroids has been found to have 6 germs present in the rats with immune cells, but there is no germs inside the rats without immune cells.
In an germ-free environment, rats ran microbially, so they lack the ability to function without the presence of such immune cells, and there is the presence of Luis Lacticella to produce immune cells.
In order to understand how germs affect the immune system, researchers cultivate lactic bacteria in the liquid, and then transfer a small amount of fluids that are germs free from mice into immature immune cells.
The immune cell development becomes resistant cells.
When the active ingredient is enamelated from the liquid, it can be demonstrated that the active ingredient is a byproduct of cysine thyroids, known as lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of styrene in the bass pigment, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when the level of styrene subsides by half, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people and rats alike have the same increased tolerance of the cells, most of us have road lactase bacteria in our stomach tracts.
Whether human beings can develop chromine-based by-products from the Luis lactic acid in the body like the mice in the experiment, which is not known at this time, but found genetic defects related to chromine in people with inflammatory albino.
She said: "The development of these cells may be exactly what we want to get, because these cells can control the inflammatory reactions of the inside of the tract.
It can be said that the number of high levels of tyrosine present in the lactosis may lead to an increase in the number of species.
Jose Mulinior argues that the Manchester United had "genius" under the guise of Nemania Mattić
On Wednesday night, in the first appearance of the Sampdotria match, Murinio destined for a "genius" midfielder at the league.

054A The bonding frame has been the favor of the Chinese Navy for many years, its 4000-foot drain, with a single 76 mm main cannon, 32 units of the red flag-16 and syring-8 anti-touch missile fired shipping system, 8 rays 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although the beginning of the building in 2006, design time is a more early boat, but its combat power even in the present and not too bad, to look at the world's protective side can reach the middle level.
But this is exactly a type 21st century original design of the kayak, the arms are placed in a single, its powertrain and electronic radar equipment compared to the current world mainstream guards already have a big gap, like Europe's same type of warranty has been fully powered, small multifunctional control radar, large size helicopter deck in the case, but also to the development of new models.
So speak of how the new Chinese warranty should develop, which has a direct relationship with its future positioning and the strategic direction of our China Navy.
The future development of the Chinese naval forces will be the bottom will become the blue waters, and the future will be to the ocean, with the vital interests of the region in China for a rapid deployment, show the existence of force, if necessary, can have a strong fighting force to ensure that China's vital interests in the region will not be damaged, so that a new era of the Houminjiang will be large-scale, remote development.
Look at the new escort in the future of the Chinese naval sequence of positioning problems, the future of the Chinese naval forces should be similar to the American naval forces, in addition to the necessary near-sea defense yachts, other major yachts will need to be organized into a fleet of nautical battles or two raids to defeat groups according to the situation.
The role of the new defender in the future fleet of aircraft battles should be filled with anti-corruption and near-regional emptying positioning, in the two attack batting groups should be filled with defenders, then according to the demand for new defenders must have strong anti-corruption capabilities and excellent mid-range regional emptying capabilities.
Based on the above positioning, you can greatly design the approximate model of the future national warranty.
First of all, the water supply relative to the current 054A type warranty will have a substantial increase, estimated new warranty drain will reach around 5000-6000; the power system will use a QC280 to improve the gas turbine and two diesel units integrated power promotion system, the highest flight speed is expected to reach around 30, the hydraulic power will also increase significantly; As for the arms configuration 76 mm main and 1130 near fire protection should be retained, but will add a red flag 10 launch system, the main should have a 32-48 unit red flag 16 upgrade and the vertical system of the 8-16 units in the rear of the body should be added to the large scale of the 18 and new navigation system, the cable can be used in the rear of the rear of the rear of the wall, the rear of the rear side of the rear stage of the rearrangement of the rearranger, the rearranger can be used in the rear range of the rear range of the rearranger, the rear range of the rear stage of the rear range of the rear range of the rear range of the rear range of the rear range of a 16 transformation of a series of the rear series of a 8-16 units of the vertical system, the rear range of a large scale of a large scale of the rear range of 18 units of the rear range of the rear range of the rear range of the rear range of the rear range of the rear range of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of 18 and the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of 18 and the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of 18 and the rear range of the main series of the rear range of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series, and the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of the main series of
The overall level of this new warranty will reach the world's first-class level, even when compared with the FFG of the United States.
Of course, the above concept is only for the author of a new domestic product warranty guessing, specifically how we can only wait until when a new type of warranty underwater to explore, let's look forward to together.

China’s family debt rate close to the United States is far more terrible than buying a home?
Recently, we are discussing the real estate policy has changed recently, is it the real estate policy to be loose? Land policy for the subject diversification, will not let the price decline?
However, in our heart of the real estate prices, heartfelt macro economic control, heart of the real estate market future when the 'People' once again written, the last time we discussed the 'People's Daily reviews for the real estate regulation and control, and now 'People's Daily' writes the article is a more serious question than buying a home, which is even if you can buy a home, you can afford to stand up?
Today, we’re here to talk about more serious questions than buying a room:
First, China's increasingly serious housing crisis
People's Daily's overseas edition published a comment on the article "Harmony and favor: The fun and play of the young people", according to the data in the article show, in November 2017, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences National Financial and Development Laboratory, the National Asset Debt Statistics Research Center released the "Three-quarter China De leverage progress report" pointed out that the resident sector's leverage rate continues to rise, from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the three quarters, up 1.3 percentage points, the first three quarters of 2017 up 3.8 percentage points.
The proportion of debt in all the physical economy in the housing sector increases, and the leverage rate rises faster.
Related research has shown that the Chinese family in the financial institutions of the ownership of consumer loans, about 2/3 of the residents' money, about 2 times the operating loans.
Among them, in consumer loans, housing loans based on the medium-term long-term loans accounted for about 80%, but from the incremental point of view, the growth rate of short-term consumer loans is faster, higher than the medium-term long-term loans.
In addition, the Chinese family debt rate is only statistically the total number of credit received by the family sector from the financial institutions, and the Chinese family also has a number of include the loan to friends of the private loan, there is a large scale of trust debt.
Seeing this kind of data, people can not help, according to the statistics of the Suon Institute of Financial Research shows that in 1996 only 3% of Chinese residents leverage, 2008 is only 18%, but since 2008 the leverage rate of residents began to show rapid growth, just six years double, to 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017 the resident leverage rate has reached 48.6%.
We compared a little more to a data, and in May last year, Bank of China issued a report of nearly tens of thousands of respondents across 9 countries.
This report was directed at 9 countries in the "Millennium generation" of young people (b. 1980–2000).
According to the report, China's 80, 90 years later, the number of young people's housing has reached 70%, the second leading Mexico (46%), and is also the United States index (35 percent) of the two-fold level.
These data tell us a question that is very likely to arise, that is, compared to buying a home, Chinese residents now in the period of the greatest potential in the 'The Grey Bull' estimate is not up to date.
Second, the housing crisis is the most serious problem?
As our previous analysis, although we have been talking about higher prices in China, but compared to other countries in the world, China's housing is actually quite high, so with its high rates of housing can't afford to buy, I'm afraid to ask a lot of friends now the problem is you can afford to pay money?
We look at the world's real estate market, China's real estate market due to the start of the late, in addition to the Hainan we previously said, has not yet appeared a large real estate crisis, but just a decade ago in 2008 the world's financial shores the origin of the real estate crisis in the United States.
The reasons for the U.S. real estate crisis were spelled out to two houses: Hollywood and the real estate.
At that time in the golden age of the United States, the real estate company in order to sell the house in order to give a low-income people at the time, the U.S. economy is good, the real estate market is also a great impact, but the good view is not long, with the U.S. economy, the growth of the shutdown, causing the income of buyers decline, so a large number of household spending began to decline.
However, the current situation in the United States is part of the U.S. family assets of financial assets and real estate, the U.S. low-income groups almost all family assets are real estate, and the top 20% of the high-income groups of most of the assets are financial assets, so it has caused the more prosperous in the U.S. home real estate the higher the credit rate.
A serious fact is that these people are buying a house when the economy is good, so pay housing is also in their good income to calculate, when income has fallen, housing pressure is not only reduced or even because some sub-sidization plans to increase floating, so this is to eliminate these U.S. family's real estate issues under each other so gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
Some people because of too low income payments can not afford housing, so the bank began to recover the property, when the bank from the hands of buyers of delinquent loans after the sale, they will be sold at a very low price, resulting in the region's housing prices step by step decline, this process also triggered a further decline in housing prices, the formation of a sexual circle, when the housing prices fall to a certain extent, more and more homebuyers find their own house value even lower than their own loans, so there are more people stop growing, but also caused more bargains.
So, a huge, stylistic loop is formed:
“Decent economy - declining income - some people can't afford housing - bank low prices for sale of inferior people's house - house prices fall - more people stop home market - bank sell again - house prices fall again..."
And the problem is more than that, because the housing price continues to decline, we stop taking the house to bank after the bank is not you have no worries, if the bank auction house to get the money or not you owe the bank's money, then you need to go next to the exchange, simply try to assume that you use the first payment of 60 million, the price of 240 million to buy a house worth 300 million, when the price falls to the house is only 200 million, you no longer want to take the house to buy the bank, the bank after the house to shoot, you do not want to lose your first payment of 60 million, the bank account of 40 million, you want to connect.
So, in this one-by-one cycle, the U.S. economy stumped in a collapse, and ultimately triggered the U.S. financial crisis of 2008.
So, now the level of Chinese family debt rate reached 46.8% is a very need to be vigilant problem, this data is still under the level of developed countries, but the problem of the Miao has started to appear, the country since last year has been repeatedly stressed to remove the leverage problem, this is a very first-in-class judgment, family debt rate if put its continuous rise in the test, will inevitably lead to huge risk, so to prevent the emergence of financial risk.
With the later house is used to live, not for hype positioning, the country is more accelerating the establishment of multi- principal supply, multi-channel security, rental and other measures to further solve the potential in the risk.
For our personal family, we must give off the real estate speculative thinking, buying a house when the strength of the line, to avoid their families into a huge burden, only reasonable assessment of their income and the level of credit is a healthy family wealth development road.

Thousands of white props
According to the records released by Time's magazine, last month's White House decided to transport a naval battle fleet helicopter to Southern Lawn for use in the U.S. manufacturing industry, spending up to $24,000.
The Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine Corps No. 1) between the white phase is an important exhibit at the White House’s construction project on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the White House High Officer have toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits feature helicopters manufactured in Connecticut, a yacht in Maine, a fire truck in Wisconsin and a forklift in Mississippi.
According to the records of the Fleet Marine Corps Marine Corps Marine Corps Marine Corps Marine Corps Marine Corps Marine Corps Marine Corps First Flight Corps (HMX-1), the Whitespace Office requires the helicopter to be present in the daily order (FRAGO), i.e. 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern lawn to participate in the "special" event.
The day before the event, the HMX-1 commander said in an email sent by the flight command of the upper naval forces, "I just want to confirm you know, because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at the south lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 for activities at 3 p.m. on the same day until it is cleared at 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.
The information also indicates that once the time of departure from the White House is rolled out, Return Return because the time limit on duty takes the second group of personnel.
The original crew is standing by the helicopter during the event, while the security guards are standing by nearby while the aircraft is located on the ground.
The records of Time magazine did not clearly indicate whether a second organization would be required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record states that HMX-1 has asked whether the campaign has violated the bill.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and was told that there was no reversal."
“It sounds like you’ve been shooked,” replied by the decess.
White House defines the "Made in the United States" campaign as an official event, so it is not subject to the "Hachi" Act.
But even the official event has political colors.
In the event, the President implemented the theme of the current Senate: medical reform, and greatly bragging the control of government regulations.
It is no new thing to use Marine Corps 1 or Air Force 1 aircraft for political purposes.
The President Alexey is required to travel on these aircraft.
But it is not uncommon to use it only for the purpose of taking photographs.
Trump was noticed in February, when it was in Melbourne, Florida, the presidential agency slowly slided, eventually stopped at the background of his first election, while his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of the presidential agency.
Linsai Walters, Deputy Press spokesperson of the White House, said, "The White House therefore the 'US Manufacturing' exhibition is exciting, this exhibition shows products from all 50 states, these products are made by American workers using American materials."
The HMX-1 crew often conducts flight trainings near the Washington area and in the southern lawns. The trainings accurately house the President of the United States in the White House.
In early July, during Trump’s participation in the G-20 summit in Germany, the HMX-1 had 58 posts in the White House practice.
An officer said that the flight of the U.S. manufacturing activity was included in the training requirements for the crew this month.
The helicopter team also flew 11 hours off the day of the "non-presidential support task".
There is no commitment to the cost of any other items in this event.
Sikorsky spokesperson said the company did not participate in arranging the southern lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 does not maintain the budget record for President Flying, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defense's 2017 fiscal year hourly fee, VH-3D's Department of Defense can report the cost of $24,380 per flight.
The Team Record recorded an aircraft flight every time they fly from the base at Virginia County County Marine Corps airport for 30 minutes.
The cost of operating the helicopter is not lower than the cost in terms of whitejack.
Walters said that "the estimated taxpayer's expenses are very misleading based on the reportable fees.
These estimates include personnel fees, maintenance fees, and many others including annual deposits.
A 2015 RAND study shows that the Department of Defense can report fees and charges do not include personnel fees, but does include oil fees, maintenance fees, and contract costs.
At the time, former press spokesman Shaun Spark used the helicopter to protect the event,
"The idea is to show what was made in the United States this week,
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of this, and they all contribute to our national security, and I guess that even hundreds of people don’t have jobs to rely on.
And I feel like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless Americans not being ashamed.
So it is not time to celebrate that."
We are not sure whether Trump is interacting with the helicopter while visiting the south lawn during the event, but he is actually sitting on the drive of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky to take his own airline plane to joke with the media.
He said, "I got to know Sikorsky plane. I have three."
