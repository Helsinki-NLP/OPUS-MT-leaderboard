Expectations of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK between January 1st and March 15th, 2020
Among the countries in the European Union/European Economic Area, as well as the United Kingdom, there is a similar prevalence of COVID-19. It is confirmed that different countries are in different stages, but the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving.
According to the experience of Italy, the national, medical, and intensive care ward needs to be more prepared to meet the surge in the number of COVID-19 patients, which is particularly important in the mission of intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, Wuhui City, Hubei Province of China reported several unknown cases of pneumonia.
On January 9, 2020, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that pathogens are a novel coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Subsequently, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are named as coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that around 80% of COVID-19 cases are gynecologic, i.e. respiratory infections that are accompanied or not accompanied by pneumonia, and most are recoverable.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 is progressing to critical illness and requires hospitalization, while the rest of the cases are progressing to critical illness and requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we evaluated the country in the European Union, the EU/European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) of the COVID-19 rate of cumulative outbreaks and compared them to the provinces of Hubei, China.
We also compared the number of existing COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK to Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 Cases in EU/EEA Countries and the UK
Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has further expanded, and the current changes in the COVID-19 epidemic in other parts of the world are similar to China.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) General Affairs Division announced COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe were reported by Spiteri and others based on WHO’s case definition in the March 5, 2020.
In the EU/EEA, France reported the earliest three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020, with patients being Imperial People in Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK have detected COVID-19 cases, from December 31 to March 15, 2019, reporting 39,768 cases and 1,727 cases of deaths, of which only Italy reported 17,750 cases and 1,441 cases of deaths.
Get the number of cumulative and cumulative incidences of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) updates the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide at 8:00 a.m. daily, from official sources such as the Department of Health, the National and Regional Health authorities and WHO.
These data have been used to evaluate COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them to Italy.
We calculate the 14-day cut-off rate for each COVID-19 case in the EU/EEA country and the UK from January 1 to March 15, 2020 as the morbidity indicator for active COVID-19 cases in order to consider the natural course of COVID-19.
We also provided the total number of reported cumulative cases in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. and compared with the data from Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
14-day interception of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom is consistent with the overall rate of outbreaks in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 has increased since around February 21, 2020, and then rushed to increase around February 28, (Additional Materials).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but the prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries as well as in the United Kingdom has also shown similar growth (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries as well as in the United Kingdom from January 31 to March 15, 2020 and compared to Italy.
It’s important to note that as of March 15, at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported the same total number of cases as in Italy in less than 3 weeks.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK reported is growing rapidly.
The observed COVID-19 circumcision has shown that the pandemic is developing at a similar rate across all countries.
Although each country is in different stages, the national public health response measures vary, each country’s definition of cases may be different, and it is used to select the need to accept COVID-19 for diagnostic tests – including additional testing – there is a difference in the patient’s program, but the situation is the same.
In early March 2020, about 10% of people with COVID-19 in the affected areas of Italy need intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have reached maximum capacity.
On the EU/EEA level, the current available data is only 6% and 1% respectively (data not shown) of COVID-19 cases that are hospitalized/entering intensive care wards.
However, the information should be collected in a systematic manner, in order to supplement the focus on the current monitoring data of the reported number of cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the number of critical care and medium-term care beds available in various European countries is very different, and that every 10 people have a range of beds ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that the resources of each country may be more or less than Italy (2010-2011 per 10 million people have 12.5 heavy-duty care and medium-term care beds).
The ECDC’s sixth update to the COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment model modeled on health care capacity and related scenarios, and estimated the prevalence of COVID-19 patients in each EU/EEA country and UK with a prevalence of more than critically ill cared for beds &gt; a relationship between 90%.
Since cases so far are gathered in certain areas of the EU/EEA country as well as in the UK, and hospitals and intensive care wards generally serve the debris population of the identified area, it is best to provide information about cases and intensive care beds on the “Standard Statistical Regional Unit 2” (NUTS-2) level.
The current trends in Italy’s experience and other countries have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEA and the UK is developing rapidly.
Therefore, the state, hospital and intensive care ward should be prepared to respond to the spread of SARS-CoV-2’s continuing community and the need for medical care, especially in the case of increased COVID-19 patients with intensive care, such as the presence of areas affected in Italy.
As the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment pointed out, the rapid, informative and comprehensive method for the spread of SARS-COV-2 is crucial, the need to curb the transition from curb to the relief method, because if not implemented in advance, the rapid growth of the expected number of cases may allow decision-makers and hospitals do not have enough time to understand, accept and adjust the corresponding measures.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to address the effects of the pandemic.
There is currently a short opportunity window, countries may take this step further to increase control to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care systems.
No, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have surges in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far been infected with more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths, resulting in huge human deafness.
Similar to its homovirus SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to be infected with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be spread by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although COVID-19’s heavy and fatality is lower than SARS, its spread is stronger, and the affected elderly are more young than young people, and men are more female.
This article aims to make a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving research topic.
We will introduce the basic knowledge about the disease, epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, pre- and prevention.
Many questions are still to be answered, but we hope this article will help understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 became the unprecedented and engraved memory of the Chinese, and the outbreak of a new kind of viral disease forced everyone to leave their accounts for the whole holiday and many weeks after it.
The virus is highly homogeneous with the coronavirus (CoV) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, which is known as coronary virus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in arrogant China and quickly spread across the country and spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in more than 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO WARNING COVID-19 has become a “core-to-core” whose threat may exceed terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 papers related to COVID-19 have been released in less than two months.
This article aims to sum up the research progress of this new field of science.
People beat COVID-19 against SARS and another illness caused by CoV – Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 eruption).
We will also discuss so far the knowledge learned about the disease prevention and prevention, as well as some urgent issues to be addressed.
It has been believed in the past that CoV is a non-fatal pathogen of humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common cold4.
But this century has already encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which were erupted in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and quickly spread to many other countries with terrible prevalence and mortality.
Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic is the third time the CoV outbreak was recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, Wuhan City first reported pneumonia cases of multiple unknown causes to the National Health Council of China on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On January 15, 2020, martial law reported the first cases of death.
At the same time, the pandemic quickly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, reports of infection by medical staff, prompting that there may be human phenomenon.
On January 23, Wuhan closed the city and shut down all public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study of COVID-19, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 have been directly connected to the Wuhae Nanhai market, which is considered the starting point of the unknown source of animal infection.
On January 30, the WHO announced the outbreak as a "global health emergency".
As of the publication of this report, the disease has spread to all regions of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig.2).
Due to the rapid development of the epidemic, the ultimate range of the outbreak and the degree of seriousness is yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided an updated description of this epidemic as shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 can infect all ages, but the main age group is 30-65 years old.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people are over 50 years of age, with the vast majority under 20, and only 14 people under 10 years of age.
Men infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/10 million) more than women (0.27/10 million).
COVID-19 is a large congregate spread in the Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average rolling period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base regeneration number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the rearranged R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected before January 23, 2020 presented an exponential growth, in line with the large-scale population flow time before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases is 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the post-consolidation mortality rate for all patients is 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors of COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large wrapper virus sub-family that contains monochromatic RNA.
They can be divided into four species, α, β, γ, and δ, where α-CoV and β-CoV are known to infect humans.
The package of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV stimuli (S) are combined with its cell receptor cytokine 2 (ACE2) and peptide 4 (DPP4) and then occurs with membrane fusion.
The virus RNA genome is encapsulated in the cell; after the replication of the viral genome, the RNA forms a vesicle containing the viral body together with the diaphragm and nuclei proteins, and then fuses and emits the virus with the texture.
The first sequence of gene groups of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported on January 10, 2020.
The results found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of β-CoV, with more than 99.98% genetically consistent among the 10 sequencing samples collected from the initial exploding point of view of the South China Sea market.
Compared to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 pellet has been found in ultra-thin slices of the popular epithelial through the transmission of e-show micros.
Research has found that ACE2 is the recipient of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, compared to SARS-CoV, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is weakened with the combination of ACE2, which is consistent with the fact that the severity of the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded in orf3b and secretion proteins encoded in orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in virus-causing and suppress the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional structuring domains or bases.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al reported that the full-length AC2 cryo-EM structure formed with the amino acid-transchange protein B0AT1 was constructed with a resolution of 2.9 Å.
They found that the complex had an open and closed object that was assembled into a copolymer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could combine two S-proteins to provide evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may be a drug candidate to suppress the therapeutic target of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origins and midhosts
As we all know, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originate in bats and transmit them to humans through nuts and bows.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoV systems, Batman is considered to be a natural host of SARS-CoV-2 because of this new virus with two SARS variants of CoV from Batman – named bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 – with 96% consistency.
However, it is unclear that the middle host helps the virus across the species barrier to infect the human beings, and its transmission is also to be known.
Ji et al proposed that the serpent was a viral cord from the bat to the man, which involved the homogeneity within the S-protein system.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China believe that in pangolin, a long kiss that eats soap, often found in middle drugs, a CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 99% genetic homogeneity, so it is believed that pangolin is a potential middle host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% of the difference between two gene groups is still huge; as such, it is still to be evidenced to provide a decisive result (Fig.33).
The chemical nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a dry environment for up to 48 hours and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar sexual properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be ultraviolet and heat sensitive – 56 °C 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing sterilization, oxyac acid, chlorine-like and other lipid-dissolving are effective in revitalizing the virus, but chlorine is no longer effective in revitalizing the virus.
Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so it is prone to this novel virus.
There are currently no detailed research reports about the immune response of SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).4
In general, viruses are first identified by the host’s inherent immune system through pattern recognition of receptors (PRRs), including Type C coagulation receptors, Toll receptors (TLRs), NOD receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
Viruses are synthesized through different pathways to inflammatory factor expression, stifling cell maturity, and IFN synthesis, which restrict the transmission of the virus and accelerate the macrophages of the virus’ antigens.
However, SARS-CoV’s N-protein can help the virus whistle immunity response.
The adaptive immune response will soon be added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphatic cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce viral speciality antibodies, while CD8+ T cells kill infected cells directly.
Assistive T-cells produce inflammatory cell factors to help prevent the above-mentioned dementia cells.
However, Cov can suppress the function of T cells by leading T cells to exterminate.
Body immunity, including those – such as C3a and C5a – is also critical to the fight against virus infection.
For example, antibodies detached from recovered patients can be neutralized and MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreactions of the immune system can produce a large amount of free radicals locally, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, in the most difficult cases, lead to multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections characterized by clustering disorders are more likely to affect older adults and pregnant women who have multiple complications.
In general, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or immunological effects are more likely to become infected than others.
Based on a study of the earliest 425 cases in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2's average opposing period is estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average swing period was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that the opportunistic period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days was based on population statistics of 8,866 cases.
For the health department, it is important to adjust the effective isolation time according to the most accurate rollover period, which prevents the transmission of the virus to others by an asymptomatic infected person.
As an example, a viral attendant or an infected person usually needs to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the isolation time be extended to 24 days?
fever is usually the main and the first symptom of COVID-19, and there are no other symptoms, and it can also be accompanied by symptoms such as coughing, embroidery, muscle pain, joint pain, coughing, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and chewing.
Some patients have difficulty breathing and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset.
Severe people will progress quickly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, toxic shock, metabolic acid poisoning and coagulation dysfunction.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should conduct viral screening for early diagnosis, even if there is no lung imaging abnormality.
A population statistical study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of various symptoms was: 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% breathing difficulties, 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Recently, two studies on family aggregation STDs and as a result of aggregation of disease have reported similar results.
In contrast, a population statistical study conducted in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients were also diagnosed with fever (98%), cough (47%), and difficulty in breathing (55%).
However, 80% of these patients require ventilation support, more than COVID-19 patients, in line with MERS’ mortality rates than COVID-19.
Seeing diarrhea (26%) and grief (21%) in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (2%-75%), difficulty in breathing (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and pain (13 -25%) have been demonstrated as the main symptom, and about 14%-20% of patients need ventilation support.
As of February 14, COVID-19 cases have been confirmed worldwide with a mortality rate of 2%.
In contrast, SARS mortality rate in 8,096 confirmed cases was 10% as of November 2002.
For MERS, the mortality rate for 2,494 confirmed cases was 37% based on a population statistical study conducted in June 2012.
An early study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47,95% confidence interval (CI) at 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 lists the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher scattering capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has to be lower than the latter.
As a result, the control of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Aggregational onset usually occurs in the same family, or from the same gathering or transportation, such as a tour.
Patients usually travel or live in martial arts or other epidemic areas within the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease, or have a close history with an infected person or patient.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms of more than two weeks, the discharged patients can carry the virus again, resulting in an alarm that extends the isolation time.
The number of peripheral leukemia cells (particularly lymphatic cells) in the early onset of the disease is normal or reduced.
For example, white cell count &lt has been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients; 4×109/L – including lymphocyte count &lt; 1×109/L – for lymphocyte reduction, aspartinine ammonia transfer enzyme levels elevated, and viral blood.
Some patients can see elevated levels of liver enzymes and muscular enzymes as well as cytokines in the blood, and most patients can see elevated levels of blood C reactive proteins and blood.
Heavy-duty patients can see the elevated levels of blood clamping protein degrading products D-2polymer and the reduction of lymphocyte counts.
Most people with COVID-19 learn from chest imagery routines, characterized by double plaque rays or lung grinding glass.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the event of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid aggregation, and sexual maintenance are interchangeable.
Both type I and type II pulmonary foam on the epithelial cell dysfunction lowers the level of surfactancy and increases the surface force, thereby reducing the lungs’ ability to run down and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest imaging science finds that usually appears at the same time as the worst degree of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathology analysis of COVID-19 was found in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease on the epithelial cell fallout, transparent membrane formation, cytoplasma infiltration and multi-nuclear cell cells, consistent with viral infections and the pathology performance of the ARDS, similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used as the primary standard for diagnosing COVID-19 with the RT-PCR test.
However, due to the high hypothesis rate that could accelerate the pandemic, China began to use the bed performance for diagnosis (rather than relying on RT-PCR alone) on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred when parsing SARS.
Therefore, combined with the medical history, clinical performance, laboratory inspection and imaging results are essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Summit team reported a proposal to use CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, a synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments that use a single trial to detect humidity in less than an hour than 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 virus copies per micron)
This new technology is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of the diagnosis if proven in a clinical sample.
Due to the lack of experience in treating novel coVs, doctors are primarily supporting the treatment of COVID-19 patients, while trying to use or recommending to other coVs – such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV – and various treatments for other viral diseases (Table2.2).
These treatments include current and potential treatment methods such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressive agents, steroids, blood clamping, pharmacology, and psychological support for patients who have recovered.
Even the recommended blood to be used for the treatment of patients who have recovered.
Pharmacovigilance companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly attacking the lungs at the beginning, and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 to a low level, such as the stomach stomach system and the stomach.
Irrespective of this, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, including frequent oxygen absorption, high-flow oxygen absorption, unventive gas and innovative mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by ECMO, an improved cardio bypass technology for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of rash infections and viral shocks, as well as protecting vital organ functions is also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
As we all know, overreacting immune system responses from SARS and MERS patients can lead to cytokines.
Cell factor storms are a form of systemic inflammatory reactions characterized by the release of a range of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines lead immune cells to a large amount of free radicals, which are the main causes of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is critical in the treatment of cytokines, especially in intensive patients.
Stalin steroids and toybells – an anti IL6 monoclonal antibody – has been used to cure cell factor storms.
Other immunosuppressive methods for cytokines include: regulating T-cell directional immune responses; suppressing IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppressing JAK; Bona organisms; cytokine-directive inhibitors 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
steroids are widely used as immunosuppressive agents to treat SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
But large amounts of steroids don’t benefit from severe lung damage for SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially the death of achemic bones, which greatly affects the prognosis.
Even so, it is still recommended that patients with hazardous illness be cautiously treated with a short-term treatment of low-volume steroids.
At the time of writing, there has been no proven antiviral treatment.
However, it has been discovered that remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, is erroneously diagnosed with a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Radesich is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilid and was originally used to treat diseases caused by the Ebola virus and the Marburg virus.
Later, it is also shown that remdesivir may inhibit other single-linked RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gilid has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are exciting.
In addition, patients with acute respiratory symptoms have been advised to use Barik’s pineapple, α-chlorin, Lopinash/Litonash, and Libavelin as their potential symptoms.
Co-operative treatment of Lopinah/Litonah may lead to diarrhea, nausea, groaning, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
These treatments should be carefully monitored for interaction with other drugs used by the patient.
Bleeding and antibody generation in recovered patients
The collection of blood from patients who are recovered from the infectious disease is used to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from infection has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients in their blood usually contain relatively high levels of antibody against pathogens.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphatic cells for the fight against pathogens and other nods, which can identify unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this principle, collect blood clump from a group of people with COVID-19 who have already recovered, and inject it to 10 patients who are seriously ill.
Their symptoms have been improved within 24 hours, while discovering reduced levels of inflammation and viral loads, increased blood oxygen and degree.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify prior to developing the speciality method to propose methods that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, consider the treatment effect, you should carefully consider some of the drawbacks related to blood.
For example, the antibody can over stimulate the immune response and cause the cytokine to release syndrome, a toxic reaction may endanger life.
The level of antibody in the blood is usually low, while the amount of blood pressure in patients with severe illness is in high demand.
It is difficult to quickly develop and produce special antibodies to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, the more crucial and practical method is to separate the B cells from the recovered patients from the body and identify the secret code of the effective antibodies, or the proteins necessary for the virus are selected as effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily scale the production of antibodies.
In China, TCM has been used to treat many diseases for thousands of years.
However, its therapeutic effect largely depends on the combination of multiple components in the formula, while the formula is different based on the diagnosis of diseases of TCM theory.
Most active ingredients are still unknown or unknown because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their best combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the primary alternative treatments for patients with moderate-to-moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from the stages of severe illness due to its lack of effective and specialistic treatments for COVID-19.
For example, a treatment of COVID-19 has been found to be effective for detoxification of vetosterilizers and creams.
In several provinces in China, 87% of patients used TCM treatment, which observed the highest cure rate for people with COVID-19, including Ganman (63.7%), Liaoxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province used TCM treatment in about 30% of patients with COVID-19 with minimal cure rate (13%).
However, this is just a rough comparison, because in the evaluation should also include many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Robert and his colleagues published a study on the treatment of WM alone with WM and TCM.
They found that the WM+TCM group temperature restoration, the symptoms disappeared, and the time required for hospitalization is short.
Most impressive is that the symptoms of the WM+TCM group are lower than the single WM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rates of the WM+TCM group are lower than the single WM group (8.8% vs 39%).
Still, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still require higher quality trials, larger ranges, and more centers to be verified.
The mechanism of action of the TCM treatment or its combination and, where possible, the effective ingredients will also be attracting attention.
Most patients who are suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 are suffering, lonely and angry because of this highly contagious and even deadly disease.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, and adverse reactions to treatment, such as insomnia caused by skin steroids, can increase anxiety and psychological embarrassment.
A series of psychological reactions were reported during the early stages of SARS outbreak, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mental exercise cravings, psychopathic symptoms, fumes, and even self-sustaining.
As part of the public health response measures to the outbreak of COVID-19, mandatory close contact person tracking and isolation can make people more attentive and guilt about the effects of infection, isolation and stigma on their family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided for people with COVID-19, suspected cases, close-minded individuals, and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication by regularly and accurately updating the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, using professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are critical for the transmission of animals from hosts and infected patients to susceptible hosts, and are often used as a means of antiviral treatment in terms of controlling the epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus.
The industry has worked hard to develop a S-protein-based vaccine to produce long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
The virus-activated vaccine has been evaluated in the SARS animal model.
However, prior to initiating clinical studies, the efficacy of these candidate vaccines in the elderly and deadly attack models and their protection against zoonotic infections has not been determined.
This is likely because SARS has disappeared 17 years ago and has not reported new cases.
In contrast, the Middle East continued sporadic cases and congregated outbreaks of MERS and spread to other regions due to the ongoing presence of a common disease in the epidemic area.
Through the use of reactive viruses, DNA grains, viral loads, nanovascular grains, viral grains and reconstructive protein Aiki, a vaccine strategy for MERS has been developed, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing safe and effective vaccines for non-immunity individuals is a task of controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this dilemma due to the length of time it takes for vaccine development (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes in CoV.
As a new type of disease, COVID-19 relatives begin to demonstrate their complete clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can get repeated and no postmortem.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 seriously ill patients also have a high prevalence and mortality rate.
Therefore, the establishment of this disease prognosis model for health care institutions to determine the priority of services is crucial, especially in the limited resources area.
Depending on the clinical study reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to a person with COVID-19 (Table 33):
AGE: Age is the most important factor that affects the prognosis of SARS, as is COVID-19.
As mentioned, in a study that included 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred primarily in the 30-65-year-old segment, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years old.
Patients who require intensive care are more likely to have foundational complications and complications, and the age is greater than those who do not need intensive care (middle age 66 is 51), suggesting that the age is a prognosis to end for people with COVID-19.
Gender: As mentioned earlier, more men who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.31/10 million vs. 0.27/10 million).
Syndromes and complications: People with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute heart loss and heart failure.
Cardiovascular events are also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also be combined with ACE2 vaginal tube cells, which can lead to frequent liver function in people with COVID-19, according to reports.
It is worth noting that age is closely related to underlying diseases and may affect each other.
Laboratory check results are abnormal: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage, which has been seen as disease, therapeutic reactions, and the potential for ultimate recovery in prognosis.
People have also proposed the severity of the CRP level with COVID-19 and the relevance of what is expected.
In addition, lifting of lactic acid chloride (LDH), aspartinine ammonia transfer enzyme (AST), tyrosine ammonia transfer enzyme (ALT) and CK may also help to predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during the organization.
Therefore, they are traditional symbols of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main symptoms of bed: Time progression of chest imaging checks and clinical symptoms should be examined with other problems to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As mentioned before, steroids are immunosuppressive agents, which are commonly used as a aid therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation and damage.
Since large amounts of cortex steroids have been widely used in heavy SARS patients, many survivors have the death of achemist’s osteoporosis, leading to lifelong illness and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used in small amounts and short periods of time in patients with COVID-19, if needed.
Psychological stress: As mentioned, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were subjected to great stress because they often suffer from long-term isolation and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of mercury and patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients stay stressed and return to normal life.
The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 seemed to be different from SARS, according to population statistics studies so far.
In addition to copying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or asymptomatic symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, an infected person will generate a large number of viruses in the course of daily activities in the early stage of the disease or incubation period, which can cause great difficulties in the control of the epidemic.
However, the spread of SARS-CoV is considered to occur when the patient is seriously ill, and most of the spread does not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more serious and difficult to control compared to SARS.
China is currently making great efforts, including sealing martial arts and cities, and segregation of almost all populations, with a view to eradiating the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have already caused significant damage to China’s economy and other aspects, the number of new cases is decreasing, suggesting that the pace of pandemic development is spilling.
The most optimistic estimate is that the burst will end in March and the falling phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so happy.
Paul Hunter and others estimate that COVID-19 is more contagious than SARS, and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. created a model for predicting the consequences of the pandemic, which is believed that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canada team reported that patients who had recovered and discharged before 2 weeks had both detected SARS-CoV-2 in the nose and swab, indicating that this newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to the flu.
However, with the decrease in the number of new cases, China has seen an encouraging sign that the current strategy may have already worked.
Ebola virus was predicted to cause 100 million cases and 50 million deaths.
However, through strict isolation, the disease is ultimately controlled.
Similar to SARS-CoV, the infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 can be weak, eventually disappearing or coexisting as a pathogenic virus with the human body.
The following provides a comparison between the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS and MERS (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be spread by coughing or sneezing, and can even be transmitted by items that are directly infected with a virus.
This virus has also been found in stool, which increases the possibility of greedy transmission.
A recent study with 138 cases reported that 41% of cases could be caused by inpatient infections, including 17 patients who had other illnesses before and 40 healthcare workers.
Therefore, it should take more closely preventative measures to protect the population, especially health care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues, even with patients or infected people have access to the bypass.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a mask; both surgical masks and N95 anti-epidemic masks (a series of 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
A surgical mask prevents droplets from being transmitted in the air from an infected person or stuck on the surface of items that may be sent to others.
However, only N95 (1860s series) masks are able to prevent the inhalation of viral agents as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viral virus being able to penetrate completely; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV, which is about 85 nm.
Since the viral velocities can even penetrate five separate surgical masks, the N95 (1860s series) face masks must be worn by the healthcare workers who are directly connected to the patient, rather than a surgical mask.
In addition to face masks, medical staff should also wear compartment to further reduce the contact with the virus.
Viruses can also be infected through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus could be brought into the body through an inflamed eye.
Therefore, medical staff should also wear a transparent face covering or nursery when facing patients.
For the public affected by the epidemic or in the infected areas, it is strongly recommended that all people wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more frequently than usual, stay indoors as much as self-isolation, and limit the contact with people who are infected.
Three feet are considered to be a proper distance for people to stay away from patients.
These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel type of virus that dips into the human world, but based on a deep understanding of the 2003 SARS outbreak, it was reported on January 7, 2020 that its high homogeneity with SARS-CoV should have caused a high threat to China.
But as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhui City Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is still in armouring the public, saying that the infection of the novel virus is not strong, the possibility of people is limited, and the epidemic is preventable.
The news clearly relaxed the vigilance of the public, but the spring season is coming, and the epidemic is locked in the martial art of the key node, and it was just missed.
The disease control body in China may draw this painful lesson and make major improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when publishing announcements, because each word is of utmost importance to citizens, can change their attitude and decision-making; (2) more sensitive and responsive to routine information from the hospital, rather than waiting for the official report of the doctor or officer; (3) more stringent controls in the early days of the potential outbreak, rather than trying to distribute the public; and (4) more frequent pairs and effective performances to improve public awareness of the epidemic, and regularly test and improve the social response system.
COVID-19 outbreak caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 begins at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it has spread across all parts of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 looks like SARS relapse.
However, there are some disparities between COVID-19 and SARS that are crucial to controlling the pandemic and treating patients.
More older adults affected by COVID-19 than young adults, more men than women, and older patients are also more serious and mortality than older patients.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
Even if there is no symptom, COVID-19 patients are still spreading the virus, and SARS patients usually transmit the virus when the condition is too severe, leading to a far higher degree of difficulty in controlling the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This section explains why the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is far faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the results of routine RNA tests from SARS-CoV-2 could be volatile.
On the other hand, patients who have been healed may re-transmitted.
These findings greatly increase the risk of virus transmission.
Considering that the study of COVID-19 is so fast, the following key questions are still to be solved:
How did SARS-CoV-2 come?
96% of the genetic homogeneity found between SARS-CoV-2 and two types of Bat SARS-CoV, but we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from Bat.
Which animal is passing the virus from the original host - as if it were a bat - to the middle host of humanity?
If we don't know the answer to Question 1 and 2, we can't effectively cut the transmission route, and the outbreak can be repeated at any time.
Difficulty molecular models and bioanalytical analyses have been shown to combine SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2, but how does the virus accurately enter gastric cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also combine other organs to express the cells of ACE2?
If these questions don’t have a clear answer, we can’t achieve fast, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus evolving in the process of human beings?
Does it become a global pandemic? Like SARS disappear as well?
Finding answers to the above and many other questions is important, but it may take a long time.
However, no matter how expensive we are, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
The origin of animal zoonotic diseases in people with coronary virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptability have been driving the common evolution of Coronaviruses (CoV) and its hosts (including humans).
Prior to 2003, two people known to have coronary virus (HCoV) that could cause minor diseases such as common colds.
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has ripped the scene, revealing the destruction and lethality of HCoV infections.
The SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in central China at the end of 2019, once again, has made CoV the focus of people's attention, and it is surprising that its spread is strong, but pathogenic, compared with its sister virus SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a type of zoonotic disease, so it will be helpful to understand the origin of HCoV zoonotic disease.
Most HCoV originates from bats and is non-pathogenic.
Some HCoV intermediate host owners are also known.
Recognize that the host of animals has a direct meaning to prevent human diseases.
Studying the interaction of the CoV host in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the incidence mechanism of human CoV.
In this review, we outline the current knowledge of seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history, the origin of animal diseases and interplay.
It is important that we compare and compare different HCoV from the perspective of viral evolution and gene restructuring.
In this context, we explored the current 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.
In addition, this article also focuses on understanding the requirements for successful host conversion and the impact of virus evolution on the seriousness of the disease.
CoV belongs to the Corona Virus Division, which is composed of a group of RNA viruses with a single chain of wraps.
These viruses have the largest genomes in the RNA virus, containing 2.6 to 3.2 million nucleus, known as the “Corronvirus” (CoV) due to the presence of a crowned state in the electronic microscopic shape.
Constructed from the ground up, COVID has a non-segmentary genome that shares a similar group.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large, significant, open-ended reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which have been translated into pp1a and pp1ab polypolyester proteins.
These polyproteins are further processed, producing 16 non-structured proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the gene group contains ORF of structural proteins, including stabbed (S), wrap (E), membrane (M), and nuclear protein (N).
Many medicinal proteins are also encoded by different meridian CoVs.
According to the differences in protein sequences, the α-CoV is divided into four mercury (α-CoV, β-CoV, γ-CoV, and δ-CoV), where the β-CoV mercury contains most HCoV and is partially divided into four mercury (A, B, C, and D).
Systems development has shown that bats and rods are the genetic source of most α-CoV and β-CoV, while birds are the main hosts of γ-CoV and δ-CoV.
For thousands of years, COVID has been crossing species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
To date, 7 people who have been infected with the coronary virus (HCoV).
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are α-CoV.
Other 5 types of β-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 often cause microscopic symptoms such as common colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, leading to severe lower respiratory infections in relatively more patients, and are more likely to develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and lung external manifestations.
In the mid-1960s, the first strain of the HCoV-229E strain, B814, separated from nasal secretions from people with common colds.
Since then, more relevant knowledge has been gained in humans through extensive studies of the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that can cause finite symptoms.
In fact, prior to the SARS outbreak, the concept of infection with HCoV is usually widely accepted.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most disruptive events in history, with more than 8,000 infected people and about 10% coarse death rate.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadicly to the rest of the world.
2019 The new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, renamed SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 3, 2020, more than 3,120 lives have been taken up and more than 91,000 infections.
The alert is already on, and the world must be ready for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All 7 HCoV species are found in animals from bats, rats or home animals.
Multiple evidences suggest that all HCoV evolution originated in the bats, the bats in which the virus is well adaptive and free of pathogenic, but exhibits great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
The zoonic origin of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving dynamics, and limiting factors of viral jumps.
In addition, it will also guide or promote the search of hosts for SARS-CoV-2, middle hosts, and larger animal hosts, which are important in preventing future virus overflows.
In this review, we outline HCoV's zoonotic origins, variances, and mechanisms for circulating diseases.
In particular, we have stressed and explored a common theme that HCoV's protovirus is usually not pathogenic in its natural storage host, but is pathogenic after spreading across species to Shinjuku host.
In addition, we also recalled the trends of HCoV evolution, where the increase in the spread is often accompanied by a pathogenic decrease.
In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Since the end of the 20th century, animal CoVs have been known.
Before the first time that nose secretions from people with common cold were separated from the HCoV-229E strain B814, physicians were separated from different CoVs in a variety of infected animals, including torch, mouse, cows, pc, cats and dogs.
Over the past decade, 7 HCoVs have been found.
Summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will provide us with rich information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections, and later adapted to growth in the WI-38 lung cell strain.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort, throat and other common cold diseases, and 10~20% of patients have symptoms such as fever, cough and so on.
In the second half of 1967, the HCoV-OC43 was detached from the rat's organ harvesting and post-contamination generations.
The clinical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to the HCoV-229E infection, and there is no significant difference in symptoms compared to other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and noseviruses.
The HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide, mainly in the winter of temperature.
Usually, the opposing period of these two viruses is less than one week, and about 2 weeks after the disease.
A study by human volunteers showed that a healthy individual infected with HCoV-229E would have a mild common cold.
Only a few patients with low immune function showed a serious lower respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as “typical pneumonia”, is the first pandemic in human history to be adequately documented by HCoV, whose pathogen is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
8,096 reported cases of SARS outbreak, 774 deaths, spread to many countries and the atmosphere.
In addition to the superstreamer, it is estimated that about 2 episodes of each case may lead to a surge in viral loads on the 10th day of the disease, between 4 and 7 days.
A person infected with SARS-CoV initially performed as an advanced condition such as muscle pain, pain, fever, discomfort, and cold wars.
The reduction of lymphocytes, liver function check routines, and creatine kinase increase are routinely detected in the laboratory.
In addition, in patients with SARS, it has been observed that diffuse tuberculosis, epithelial cell proliferation, and macrophages have increased.
About 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these seriously ill patients, multiple organs, including the stomach canal, liver, and limbs, may also be infected, and often associated with cytokines, which can be fatal in patients with low immune function.
The virus starts with separating from the open lung active living of a person who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
People have been working on HCoV since then.
HCoV-NL63 was detached from a 7-month-old mother-in-law in the Netherlands by the end of 2004.
Initially found that the virus was popular among young children, the elderly, and the immune-ravaged patients with respiratory diseases.
In the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63, there are common rheumatoid, rheumatoiditis, fever, and fine bronchitis.
Another independent study showed that the same virus was separated from the nasal specimen of one Dutch 8-month-old boy with pneumonia.
Although the virus is found in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, whose peaks are onset in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive throat (also known as Gruber throat).
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong due to pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community access to pneumonia and tuberculosis, HCoV-HKU1 is also reported about acute asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found in the world, which can cause respiratory problems.
HCoV has well adapted to humans and is often less likely to have mutations that cause high pathogenic diseases. But there are also unexpected occurrences and unknown causes such as HCoV-NL63, a more toxic and rare subtype, which has recently reported that the subtype caused a serious lower respiratory infection in China.
Oftentimes, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively transmit and survive in humans, their toxicity or pathogenicity can also be reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old acute pneumonia and limbs patient in Saudi Arabia.
Although the majority of lab confirmed cases were from the Middle East, the cases of input were reported in European countries and Tunisia, in which occasional spontaneous transmissions occurred to closely connected persons.
In 2015, rape spread in South Korea was erupted again, confirming 186 cases.
The clinical performance of MERS is similar to SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also experienced acute lipid dysfunction, which is a unique feature of MERS in diseases caused by HCoV so far.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of stomach abdominal disease such as diarrhea and chewing.
As of February 14, 2020, the reported lab confirmed cases of more than 2500 cases, with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humanity.
In late December 2019, in Wuhu City, Hubei Province, China, discovered patients with clustered pneumonia, identified as linked to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health event of international concern and the disease is named COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide with a crude mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the death rate of Hubei in China is 4.2%, while the death rate of those outside Hubei is 1.2%.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe respiratory infections, manifesting as fever, cough, and respiratory distress.
Some patients also experience diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms, can rapidly develop as a acute respiratory syndrome.
Thanks to the homogeneity of 82% of high nucleotide sequences, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar, but they are clustered into different branches in the development of systems.
The pathogenic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are low compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but are more contagious.
SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections have been reported, which may accelerate the rapid transmission of the virus around the world.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with 6 other HCoV types, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of the HCoV disease are very similar.
At this point, SARS-CoV-2 is in line with the general trend of 6 other HCoV types.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and HCoV (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections are more common in the community in getting HCoV infections, including non-trivial, glare, and even asymptomatic.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe cases of COVID-19 are similar in the SARS-CoV infection, which is slightly lower.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows the interesting pattern characteristics of community get HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the community’s accessibility of HCoV.
On the other hand, the transmissible nature of SARS-CoV-2 will be similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but remains to be verified after human transmission.
Finally, in the same way as other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a compact sample.
At least in some cases, whether the greed-verbal spread of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in SARS-CoV, and remains pending clarification of future studies.
In addition, it is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal like a community to get HCoV.
However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2, pathopathic and post-transplant persistent transmissions, and other characteristics, will have an important impact on the current COVID-19 pandemic’s ultimate fatalities.
All 4 community accessive HCoVs that cause glorious micro-symptoms have well adapted to humans.
From another angle, humans have well adapted to these 4 HCoVs.
Both sides may be the survivor of the ancient HCoV pandemic, in terms of their terms.
HCoV, which causes serious diseases in humans, and those who suffer from severe HCoV diseases, have died.
To this end, HCoV must be sufficiently replicated in humans to increase adaptive mutations, thus combating host limiting factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more people are infected, the more likely it is to fully adapt to the human possibility.
If it fits well, then it will be spread in humans very hard to stop by isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, these 4 communities have spread with sexual coronary coronaviruses, causing people with normal immune function to develop common colds.
These viruses do not require animal hosts.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and cannot be continuously disseminated in humans.
They need to be made and prospered in a livestock-related host, and may pass on one or more middle hosts and masters to find opportunities to spread the risk of becoming vulnerable to human targets.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to that of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 communities.
It is highly contagious as a community with HCoV, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV, which is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it can fully adapt to humans, and in the absence of the host or middle animal host loops inside the human body, there is still to be seen.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, first discuss the evolution of HCoV hosts, natural hosts, storage hosts, intermediate hosts and host definitions and characteristics, we have some guidance.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor at the level of the nucleotide sequence, the animal will become the evolutionary host of HCoV.
The ancestor virus is usually highly adaptive and pathogenic in this host.
Likewise, the host will continue to carry HCoV over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is both a natural infection and a natural host of HCoV or its viruses.
In contrast, if the HCoV Master was sent to the middle host shortly or immediately and sent to the human body, it would not be well adapted to the Shinjuku host, and is usually pathogenic.
This middle host can act as a common source of human infection to humans, and by allowing the virus to be replicated in short, then spread it to humans in order to grow the size of the adult infection, thereby magnifying the role of the host.
If HCoV does not maintain its transmission within the middle host, there may be a terminal infection.
Instead, HCoV can also adapt to mid-hosts or even build long-term localities.
In this case, the middle host becomes a natural survival host.
The epidemiological data regression analysis found that SARS indexed cases were linked to a history of foundry animals.
The follow-up serum probability survey showed that animal dealers have higher levels of immune globulin (IgG) against SARS-CoV than the general population.
In the live animal market, chicks (flower paralysis) and a single paralysis were first found to carry almost identical SARS-CoV virus to the SARS-CoV virus.
There is no further SARS report after clearing all the fruit foxes in the market, this fact indirectly supports the above points.
However, the report says that wild or unconnected live animal market farm fruit foxes detect the basic prominence of SARS-CoV, which indicates that the fox may be just a middle magnified host, not a natural host of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that as 80% of the different animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, it is not possible to rule out a variety of small mammals that may also act as a possible host between SARS-CoV.
All of these animals seem to be end hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequently, the study of the hosts of SARS-CoV natural animals found a closely related bat coronavirus, called the SARS-related bat crown virus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), that survived the Chinese bats.
These bats are characterized by a sequence of genomic sequences against SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bats coronavirus are homogeneous with 88-92% nucleotide sequences from SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for bats as a new concept for the host of new human pathogens.
In addition, researchers have also identified several SARS coronary virus (SL-CoV) from their bats, but there are no viruses that can be separated from them as live viruses, in addition to a specified one.
Human vascular mercury conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor of known SARS-CoV.
The WIV1 extracted from the bat sample is proven to use bats, fruit wolves, and man ACE2 as a receptor for its entry into the cells.
Interestingly, a SARS recovery patient’s serum is able to neutralize and remove WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the ancestor closest to Bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
Although the two viruses are highly homogeneous, it is usually considered that the WIV1 is not a direct generation of SARS-CoV viruses, and bats are not a direct host of SARS-CoV hosts.
System development analysis uses MERS-CoV as the same group as bats CoV-HKU4 and bats CoV-HKU5.
Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor peptides 4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.
MERS-CoV’s RNA abusive RNA polymerase sequences are being developed in a system closer to corresponding RNA in Bats β-CoV from Europe and Africa.
Until now, the living MERS-CoV has not been found in the wild bats.
MERS-CoV has just 87% nucleotide sequence homogeneity with its near-bats CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, the bat may not be a direct host of memory for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the singular peak of the MERS-CoV sensitivities and antibody serums have been so dominant as the origins of several African countries in the Middle East.
A living MERS-CoV separating from a single peak of nasolabial swamps is the same as the virus found by the human body, which further shows that the mortar is the real host of MERS-CoV memory.
Similarly, it is important to point out that in the swelling of experimentally infected MERS-CoV, the general symptoms are small, but a large number of viral falls are observed.
It is worth noting that the infection not only spread the virus through the respiratory tract, but also spread the virus through the mouth, and the mouth is also the main way of the bat spreading the virus.
However, the problem still exists, as many MERS confirmed cases did not have a history of contact with the disease before the symptoms occurred, which could be due to the transmission of people or unknown routes, including the species of animals carrying the MERS-CoV that were not identified.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homogeneity with bats detached from bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the serial difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to determine the relationship.
That said, the bat may not be a direct host of the SARS-CoV-2 host unless the virus is found almost identical in the future.
The mid animal host in SARS-CoV-2 is predicted to be in the wholesale market in the South China Sea, where many of the initial COVID-19 cases were linked, indicating that there could be a transmission of animals to humans.
Recent macro-generating studies have shown that a dangerous small mammal known as pangolin (Malay pangolin) may also carry β-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin coronary virus gene groups have 85-92% nucleotide serial homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are closely related to RatG13, with about 90% homogeneity at the level of nucleotide sequences.
In system development, they are called two SARS-CoV-2 variants, one of which has a more similar receptor synthesis domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 and an homogenous 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In contrast to its formation, the RBD differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are larger, and the serial homogeneity of the whole genome is higher.
A previous study on pangolin disease also reported the detection of virus clusters from lung specimens, and the results were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study uses different assembly methods and human handling, and has obtained a partial genetic assembly sequence of about 86.3% of the viral whole genome.
We can't rule out pangolin is possible as one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, since there is a difference in the β-CoV sequences related to pangolin SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence that the direct source of SARS-CoV-2 comes from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin related β-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 The path to evolution in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined.
The highest serial homogeneity was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, but β-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 related β-CoV.
It can be highly speculated that the high similarity between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related β-CoV and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is caused by the evolution of the selective guide.
Another opposite point is that pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related β-CoV and RatG13 are reborn in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving force, reconstructing is widely present in β-CoV.
The origin of direct zoons in SARS-CoV-2 is not yet true.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, researchers studied the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1.
The evidence of system development suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from the Batman virus, and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1’s generational virus has also been found in the infected animals.
The report says the Bat Crown Status Indicator, found in the North American tricolor bat, is closely related to the HCoV-NL63, which is called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV).
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E has a genetic connection with another type of bat coronavirus (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008) found in Ghana, and genomic animals are also dubious to be among the hosts.
For clarity, Figure 1 and Table 2 summarize existing knowledge about the origin of known HCoV animals.
System development analysis provides evidence for historical HCoV intermodal events.
A pandemic of respiratory infections occurred after 1890 when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from livestock cross species.
The history of HCoV-229E is unknown.
The bat α-CoV closely related to the HCoV-229E has been discovered.
There was a lamb α-CoV between the two.
Multiple evidences support the direct transmission of viruses from bats to humans.
First, humans, not sheep, may be in common living conditions with bats.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with sheep sharks.
Secondly, the bat α-CoV associated with the HCoV-229E is versatile and non-pathic in the bats, while the lamb α-CoV bat has caused an outbreak of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, no sheep α-CoV was found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of α-CoV related to the HCoV-229E being obtained from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipa, and Hendra.
Therefore, it is not surprising that Batman broadcasts HCoV-229E directly to humanity.
Alternatively, tube bats α-CoV acts as the gene bank for the HCoV-229E, but lamb and peaks may be transmitting the virus to the middle host of humans, which is exactly the same as the MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV was well described from bats to single peaks and from single peaks to human transmission.
Batman's MERS-CoV evolutionary origins have been known in their original hammer set, and subsequent discoveries have also strengthened this argument.
However, Batman provides a rich library of virus types for inter-generational exchange and inter-distribution of genetic fragments.
Long and intensive groups, close social interaction and strong flight capabilities are the favorable conditions for Batman to become the ideal "viral broadcaster".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the single peak for decades.
It fits well with these fortunes, and the fortunes have also changed from the middle host to a stable natural survival host.
MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains relatively low mutation rates.
It is an accident to the human sporadic spread, and due to the inability to continue the spread, humans are still the ultimate host of MERS-CoV.
The role of pangolin in the SARS-CoV-2 spread (if any) is different compared to the role of dingling in the MERS-CoV spread.
In particular, pangolin β-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolin.
They may be end hosts of β-CoV-related μg-CoV, similar to fruit wolves in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is necessary to determine or rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spreading from animals to humans.
First of all, the bat could be the exact same host of the SARS-CoV-2-related viruses as the SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share their positions with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolins may be one of the middle-large hosts of a new invasion of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses.
Humans are infected with the virus by embarrassing and eating wild tastes.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys of livestock and wildlife are necessary.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 may be reorganized and adapted in the third species that has been accessed with bats and pangolins as described above.
Research on the origin of animals in SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors in the virus to promote the Corona Virus across the barrier has also played an important role.
First, they have a high turbulence rate in RNA replication.
Compared with other single-linked RNA viruses, the mutation rate estimated by the coronavirus is "medium" to "high", according to the coronavirus's adaptability to the main stage of Shinjuku, the average replacement rate per point 2 is about 10-4 times per year.
Coronal virus has a nucleic acid extracution of proofreading activity, and its removal will result in very high variability and decay, even incapable of survival.
Interestingly, known nucleotide-like Remdesivir suppresses coronary virus replication by suppressing this RNA-based nucleic acid excision enzyme and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Radesich is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 medications to be tested in a clinical trial.
However, the mutation rate of coronavirus is about 100 million times higher than its host.
In addition, if the coronavirus does not properly adapt to the host, its mutation rate will usually be high.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high turbulence, the turbulence rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower, indicating that it is more adaptive to humans.
It can be speculated that it has been adapted to another host close to humanity.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also suitable for MERS-CoV, which is well suited for single peaks.
Theoretically, genetic bleaching is unlikely to quickly invalidate vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the large RNA gene group in the coronary virus has extra plasticity in the repairs of gene mutations and regroups, which increases the possibility of synergization of a variety, which is conducive to the emergence of the new coronavirus at the right time in the condition.
Evidence of a large number of unique open frame and protein features facing gene group 3' end coding.
Third, the crown virus in the RNA replication process through a unique "copy selection" mechanism random and frequent switch template.
Among the hosts of mixed containers, there is a frequent exchange between the CSV RNA record.
Highly homogeneous full-length and subgenome RNAs can regenerate new coronaviruses.
Scientific evidence in system development for natural recompositions has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and bats CoV-HKU9.
Broadcast-related virus-host interaction
In addition to the above three viral factors, the interaction between viruses and host receptors is another key factor that affects the spread of species.
This article uses the restructure of SARS-CoV as a typical example, showing evidence of a positive choice in a variety of inter-broadcast events.
Based on the analysis of human and fruit swollen SARS-CoV separation strains, researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, especially through the S-protein RBD mutation to achieve this process.
In general, RBD in the coronary virus S-protein interacts with cell receptors and is strongly selected by host antibody reactions.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is located in the 318 to 510 amino acids of the S1 segment, which is combined with people ACE2 and their shared receptors to bring the virus into.
The RBD of SARS-CoV identifies ACE2 receptors of a wide variety of animals, including bats, nuts, moss, and wolves, thereby spreading the virus across different species.
In fact, only 6 amino acids are found in the RBD that are separated from the strain by human and fruit paralysis virus, with 4 styli located in the synthesis order of the receptor that interacts with ACE2 receptors.
There are K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of Fruit Soybeans SARS-CoV, which may increase the Coupled Protein’s coherence with human ACE2 receptor interactions.
In words, the replacement of these two types of amino acids may be crucial for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptors as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S-protein S1 unit is 30%, which means that its S-protein combined with man ACE2 may have changed its ability.
Indeed, a cold electron study showed that this combination of harmony is 10 to 20 times higher than that of people between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine if any other communists are required to be broadcast in SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also combined with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E’s aminoamino acid peptides N and HCoV-OC43’s 9-O-acetyl sialic acid.
They may also explain the reasons why the coronavirus was successfully adapted to humans after transmission from the animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of HCoV diffraction are also influenced by the dependence and limitations of other hosts.
The differences between these host proteins in humans and natural hosts such as bats, single peaks and spills of animals, etc.
HCoV must rely on the host factors and break the host constraints in order to successfully achieve a variety of interplay.
In this regard, the virus - the host interacts with the molecular determinants of this important field still need to be identified and represented.
Host dependent on SARS-CoV-2 and limiting factors using the latest CRISPR technology can achieve results.
The emergence of the new HCoV: back to the origin
The versatility of the Bat Crown Status virus provides ample opportunities for the emergence of the new HCoV.
In this sense, the Batman virus acts as the gene bank for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutations and gene recompositions are also driving factors for the evolution of HCoV, which are also two important steps of the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes could completely change the surface of the virus.
In SARS-CoV assisted proteins, due to separation from SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, it is believed that ORF8 is important for humans to adapt to humans by discovering that they can encode different ORF8 proteins.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotide missing features from SARS-CoV were found in the separating strain of the virus.
This defect is dividing ORF8a and ORF8b into ORF8a and is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may occur overweight with α- and γ-CoV strains, where a large number of smaller recomposition areas have been found in the RNA-derived RNA polymerase.
Recomposition points have also been found in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Likewise, studies have shown that the popularity of MERS-CoV has experienced regrouping events between different bands, which takes place in the single peaks of Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganisation events have also been observed in other HCoV, where HCoV and other animal coronaviruses are reorganised in their non-communicable genes.
It should also be noted that the manual selection may cause unexpected changes in the virus gene group, which is likely due to the diminishing choice of host immune system in the face of the virus.
An example of these effects is that in the HCoV-229E Prototyping strain, the absence of nucleotide leads to the absence of a full-length ORF4.
The complete ORF4 can be observed in the bats and skull virus related to the HCoV-229E, but the lamb α-CoV displays individual nucleotide insertion, causing a transportation mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by host choice.
After bat infection with coronary virus, detection of asymptomatic symptoms or just mild micro-symptomatic symptoms, indicating the interaction between coronary virus and bats.
From anatomy and physiology perspective, bats appear to be well adapted to coronavirus.
For example, a flaws in bat-inflammatory reaction have effectively reduced pathological changes caused by coronary viruses.
In addition, due to the low level of the expression level of complex I-molecular I-molecular in the main tissue compatibility of the inhibitive natural target NKG2/CD94, the natural target cell activity of the bat is suppressed.
Moreover, high-level active oxygen (ROS) generated by bat hyperchloride activity can both inhibit the replication of coronary virus, and can be affected by the nucleic acid outcision enzyme matching, which gives the strain the choice of high pathogenic when entering Shinjuku.
More pathogenic coronary strains may also evolve through recomposition, resulting in new protein or protein characteristics to suit the host.
Therefore, in the last two decades, there have been three new HCoV models that are not accidental.
Coronviruses are not disease-causing or cause microscopic symptoms in host's survival, such as bats and knees.
They make a lot of duplication and do not cause strong host immunity reactions.
That’s why there are people who are infested with the disease and the causes of serious infections in humans.
The emergence of severe symptoms is mainly due to excessive activation of immune response and cytokine, so the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lungs will be.
In contrast, the immune response has been decoupled from the coronary virus replication among those with an inymptomatic condition.
The same strategy that causes immune response chain may have a vague effect in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The coterin reaction in the bat is particularly strong.
Therefore, it should be beneficial to use type I-chlorine at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, the NLRP3 inflammatory body activation in the bat is also defective.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to suppress the treatment of NLRP3 inflammatory bodies may be useful for COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme based on the production of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Despite the discovery of β-CoV with 95% nucleotide homogeneity, there is also a nucleotide homogeneity of up to 96% with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been discovered that fruit foxes and other animals in the market carry the same virus as SARS-CoV but have not yet been identified as a direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
It has been found that pangolin β-CoV, which is the same source as SARS-CoV-2, indicates that pangolin may be one of the middle hosts, or pangolin β-CoV may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally or unintentionally made.
With the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus has re become the focus of people's attention.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the origins of HCoV zoonotic diseases and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.
A lot of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are broadcast to humans through middle hosts.
Molybdenum for SARS-CoV infection stems from the connection between humans and fruit foxes on the market, closing the stock market and catching dead foxes can effectively end the popularity of SARS.
Similarly, the rays found multiple β-CoV-related pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2 should be removed from the stock market to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases.
But whether SARS-CoV-2 has spread to humans through pangolins and other mammals, there is still to be further research.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been around for a long time in a single peak.
These mortars are an important means of transportation and are the main sources of local meat, milk, leather and hair products.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to live all guns to control MERS by following the Chinese wild animal market’s practices to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the outbreak of MERS again, other infection control measures should be combined, and comprehensive measures should be taken to develop effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccines for snoring.
As we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genomes may appear, which can cause outbreaks.
Various species of zoonotic coronaviruses circulate in wild environments.
In particular, the versatility of the bat virus with the potential to develop a zoonotic is high.
These zoonotic coronary virus have many opportunities to evolve and reorganize, resulting in easier transmission and/or deadly coronary virus present in humans in the future.
In some parts of China, the culture of wild animals should be squeezed to reduce unnecessary connections between humans and animals.
After years of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 exams, we should develop better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have been present on Earth for a long time.
They stay in their own natural hosts until overflowing opportunities appear.
Although bats have many characteristics that are beneficial to the spread of the virus, if people are educated away from bats and other wildlife species, then human access to bats and other wildlife species will be greatly reduced.
In order to better understand the nature of the coronavirus and its natural hosts, it is necessary to monitor mammals, facts will prove that this is very useful for preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
All in all, the most effective way to prevent zoonotic disease is by human beings who should live away from the natural host of zoonotic diseases.
There are still numerous malpractices in the origins of zoonotic diseases in SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if bats spread an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolin, it is interesting to examine bats and pangolin under what circumstances it is possible to share the same bit of life.
Second, if the bat plays a more direct role in the spread of human beings, then how human beings intersect with the bat is still to be determined.
Third, if the third mammals act as a real middle host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be conducted.
In the case of bats, pangolins, or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be discovered in the future in a natural host, or similarly to its generational virus.
Ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for “possible cases” and “confirmation cases” are required to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our team published the 2019 COVID-19 Rapid Recommendations for Diagnosing and Treating COVID-19 infections, which we’ve provided experience and borrowed from around the world.
However, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease, based on ongoing research and clinical practice, and our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to the comments on the above guidelines and provided the latest "suspecting cases" and "confirmation cases" diagnostic criteria based on the latest COVID-19 diagnostic program (version 7) released by the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, currently officially named as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), was named as the SARS-CoV-2, the most acute respiratory syndrome.
On March 11, 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) named COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and published the guide online to the Journal of Medicine Research on February 06, 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted a wide range of attention.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new type of disease, based on ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Council of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) released the seventh edition of the COVID-19 diagnostic program from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, some of which have undergone practical changes.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou et al., and they come up with a simple scoring plan based on their own clinical experience.
Their work provides our guide with new evidence and also provides valuable references to this global pandemic.
We know that they do this important work and express their gratitude.
However, their proposal also needs to be updated based on the latest COVID-19 diagnostic solution (e.g. seventh edition) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), the diagnosis of suspected cases need to combine a epidemiological history features with two clinical performances for a comprehensive analysis, if there is no clear history of epidemiology, you need to meet three clinical performances:
History of Epidemiology: (1) A history of travel or residence has occurred in the community with COVID-19 cases in Wuhan City and the surrounding areas or in other areas within the 14 days immediately preceding the occurrence of the symptoms; (2) a history of access with SARS-CoV-2 infections (a nucleic acid test has been sore); (3) a history of access within the 14 days immediately preceding the occurrence of the symptoms to patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from a community with COVID-19 reported in Wuhan City and the surrounding areas or other regions; (4) a congregatedative confirmed cases (within the 2 weeks immediately preceding the occurrence of the symptoms, within a small range ≥2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms such as home, office, school class, etc.) have a history of access to patients with symptoms in the communities with COVID-19 reported in Wuhan City and the surrounding areas.
Clinical performance: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) image-based characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) the number of white cells in the early onset is normal or reduced, and the lymphatic cell count is reduced.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases and have one of the following evidences of pathogens or serums: (1) Real-time PCR tests of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported soaring; (2) virus-wide sequencing displays highly homogeneous sources of COVID-19 virus known; (3) episodic IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests have been reported soaring; or SARS-CoV-2 episodic IgG antibodies have been reported from variability to variability, or drip ≥4 times higher than acute periods.
We can see the addition of real-time PCR nucleic acid tests in respiratory or blood specimens in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
The fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020) added blood-marked pathological tests on pathogens; the seventh edition added serotonic evidence.
These modifications are based on researchers researching the best nucleic acid tests for rapid diagnosis and continuous work, as well as the respiratory specimens including blooding, which increase the availability of different specimens and provide evidence for the inclusion of the rudimentary results of the superiority antibodies into the correct diagnostic criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us to pay attention to patients with atypical symptoms and asymptomatic symptoms.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou and others should be updated because they will have no clinical symptoms named "low risk".
In addition, the rating system also needs to be confirmed in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we would like to present more direct evidence and call the reader to send their comments.
For the diagnosis of "possible cases" and "confirmation cases", we recommend referring and following the latest guidelines for the country where the cases are located.
Our team will also keep our guide up to date to help.
Bangladesh reports new COVID-19 deaths at a new high in its day
Bangladesh confirmed to add five new cases of COVID-19 death yesterday.
This creates a new high in single-day deaths due to the virus.
As of yesterday, in the case records reported by the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Control (IEDCR), there were 114 confirmed cases, 33 cured cases after rest at home.
17 cases of cumulative deaths.
At the online news conference, IEDCR’s captivity, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said these deaths included 4 men and 1 woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60, and two cases are between the ages of 51-60, and one case is between the ages of 41-50.
She also said that two of the death patients were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on March 11 that COVID-19 is a global pandemic.
One of the deaths was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital, according to a medical officer at the local news media Anadolu Agency.
On Saturday, the minister of road transport in Bangladesh and the minister of bridges Obaidul Quader announced via online video that public transport will be out of the original schedule, extending until this Saturday.
The public transport suspension begins on March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The basic items such as medical, fuel and food can still be transported properly.
On March 8, two of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 recorded in Bangladesh were returned from Italy, and one of the other was the wife of one of the confirmed patients.
As of March 19, these 3 patients have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than a million infections worldwide
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the total number of global SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections has been more than 100 million on Thursday.
At least 5.2 million deaths are related to coronavirus-induced diseases - COVID-19.
On the same day that the milestone occurred, Malawi confirmed the first coronavirus infection in the country, with the first cases of death related to the coronavirus in Zambia.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed that the country was one of the few countries without the coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 1051635 confirmed cases, including 79332 cases within 24 hours before 10am (0800 UTC) on 4 April Central European Time.
In the United States, more than 24.4 million cases of coronavirus have been reported, causing at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News cites Johns Hopkins University’s data report that on Wednesday, coronavirus infections have resulted in more than 1000 deaths in the U.S.
All over the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to suppress the dispersion of diseases.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Mayor of Moscow, extended the lockdown date to May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians will continue to receive compensation during the shutdown period until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament decided to extend the state emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved by 215 votes, 10 votes, and 1 votes against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew of the Holy City of Mecca and Medina and changed to the curfew throughout the day; before, the curfew was only valid between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Mayor of Ohio Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended home order until May 1.
Australia's stores reduce the maximum number of siblings per transaction
On Saturday evenings and Sundays, Woolworths and Coles, one of Australia's leading stores, have lowered the maximum cost of each transaction for all their stores to two bags and one package, respectively, across the country.
ALDI also introduced a limited package limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted in the form of messages to the inboxer or to the Facebook page posted to the store.
The buyer is looking for goods due to fear of COVID-19 in case they need self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limits the number of siren purchases to each one.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced a limit of 4 packs per trade limit on March 4 and 5.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that the implementation of a limit of 4 packs, "many stores still sold out within an hour after the shipment" and called the demand "unprecedented", at the same time, ALDI on Tuesday's Facebook post called its "sumptionless".
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, last week's sales "rush to increase".
Last week, the Costco store in Canberra has also limited the amount allowed to two bags.
In order to further understand the shortage, Coles ordered more packaging from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional inventory, while ALDI rule prepared inventory in advance for scheduled Wednesday special offers.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Consortium, says retailers try to increase inventory, but local conventions limit the delivery of trucks to make it difficult.
He expects that production costs will rise as suppliers strive to meet demand, and special events will be reduced.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that some shops will not be able to carry out Wednesday special offers after the inventory is released in advance.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Science and Technology, said the store is in stock every night.
He said that siblings are large items, so inventory is small, and, once sold out, will leave a huge shelf space, coupled with the sense of material shortage.
“The point of Coles and Woolworths is that if there are a lot of things on the shelves, such as rollers and hand sanitizers, you may not be so panic,” Russell Zimmerman said about ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap, a regeneration pad manufacturer, said on Wednesday that they have no inventory yet.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark who manufactures clean toilets and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent toilets are strong, they are working around the clock, always on weekends to ensure supply.
The real estate website Domain.com reported that, because buyers are taking a long weekend off, the number of auctions held is small, so some real estate dealers will provide free toiletries to the first bidder at the auction fair in Melbourne.
NT News is a printed daily newspaper in the city of Darwin that contains 8 pages in its Thursday edition of the newspaper, designed to be used as a sibling after cropping.
According to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, the store did not initially intend to impose limits on purchases, and they stated that they did not plan to impose limits on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman is filled with high demand for other commodities, including masks, hand sanitizers, dryers, hand sanitizers and face powders.
Similarly, outside Australia, OCado, an online supermarket in the UK, has limited the amount of Andres' siblings to 2 packs on Sunday night, 12 volumes per pack.
World Health Organization Announces COVID-19 as a Pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 pandemic (disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) was a pandemic.
Although the “pandemic” phrase refers only to the degree of disease scattering and not the degree of danger of a particular case, the WHO states that it is necessary to urge the government to take steps:
“All countries can still change the process of this pandemic.
If the people of each country are tested, tested, treated, isolated, tracked, and mobilised as measures to respond, “the WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.
“We are deeply amazed by the degree of dispersion and the degree of dishonestness and dishonestness.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was “unprecedented”.
He commented on CNN in February, “In addition to the flu, he did not find out which respiratory virus has been continuously dispersed to the world in the future.”
Ghebreyesus expressed similar views and said, "We have never seen the pandemic caused by coronavirus before."
He continued to say, “Ibid., we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled.”
Prior to entering the new state of the pandemic, the WHO determined in January that the outbreak was a public health event of international concern.
Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the outbreak, “most importantly, it is still slammed.”
By Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, causing more than 4600 deaths.
2019-2020 The COVID-19 pandemic is a continuation of the spread of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, a type of acute respiratory syndrome.
The outbreak was confirmed in martial law in China in December 2019, a public health emergency that was listed as an international concern on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, the global cumulative report of 210 countries and territories reported approximately 161 million COVID-19 cases, about 9.7 million deaths,
Heal about 36.4 thousands.
The death rate in China is about 4%, while the death rate in regions around the world ranges from 0.08% (New Zealand) to 13.4% (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and rush.
and may be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, etc.
The opportunistic period from patients receiving treatment to the onset varies from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.
There are currently no vaccines or special effects antiviral treatment options available.
Clinical treatment is mainly based on support for treatment. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, coughing and padding, maintaining a safe distance with others, monitoring and self-isolation of people who are suspected to be infected.
The official agencies of each country have taken measures to limit travel, quarantine, curfew, workplace risk prevention and control and facilities shut down.
The pandemic has led to a serious global social economy, and sports, religion, political and cultural activities have been rolled out or cancelled, and panic shopping has increased the supply shortage of large scales.
Around 99.4% of primary and secondary school students are affected by national or local suspensions in 193 countries and regions around the world.
Due to false information being transmitted online, there has been an xenophobic and discriminatory incident against the Chinese, other East Asia and Southeast Asia blood and appearance groups, as well as among the affected regions of the epidemic.
However, the reduction of mobility and heavy industrial shutdowns make the air pollution index decline, carbon emissions reduction.
On December 31, 2019, the health department of China's martial arts department reported a number of cases of unknown cause of pneumonia, and initiated the investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the South China Sea’s wholesale market, so COVID-19 is considered a common animal disease.
The outbreak, called SARS-CoV-2, is a novel virus that is closely related to the bats coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first patient to be discovered was confirmed on December 1, 2019, and has been unidentified with a number of recent South China Sea market cases.
Two-thirds of the early cases reported in the December 2019 issue were confirmed to be related to the South China Sea market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unauthenticated report saying that the first case could be traced back to November 17, 2019, with patients 55 years of age, from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a drop in new cases in China, but a sudden increase in cases of new reports in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China exceeded the first time in the territory.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially cases of malformation.
As of February 26, the reported cases of adolescents were relatively small, accounting for only 2.4% of the world’s 19-year-olds and younger. UK chief scientific advisor Patrick Varans estimates that the UK needs about 60% of the population to be infected with COVID-19 in order to get effective group immunity.
Case count refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have confirmed that the test result is vague according to the official program.
As of March 23, the proportion of groups that have been tested in countries around the world has not exceeded 3% of the total population, and many countries have issued official policies that do not monitor the population of people with ADHD, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 indicated that 86% of people with COVID-19 in China estimated to be undetected as of January 23, with 79% of those undocumented.
According to a statistical analysis published on March 30, the number of cases reported by the actual number of infections in Italy.
The basic infection number (R0) for COVID-19 was initially estimated between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the US CDC found that R0 could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients can be recovered.
Unrelievable patients are 6-41 days from onset to death, most often 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 9.7 million people died of COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China are in people over 60 years of age, 75% of deaths are accompanied by underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes at the same time. Official statistics of COVID-19 deaths often refer to cases with severe deaths according to the official program.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be overstated because the data may not include undetected patients, such as those who die at home, in hospitals, etc.
Part of the data from Italy shows that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic is 4-5 times the number of deaths from the official statistics of COVID-19.
A spokesperson for the U.S. CDC said: “We know [the number of deaths announced] is less than the actual value,” and that the undervalued news about U.S. data has also proven this. Underestimated the number of epidemics that often occur, such as the 2009 H1N1 sluggish flu pandemic. On January 9, 2020, martial law first confirmed deaths in China.
On February 1, the first cases of death occurred outside of China in the Philippines, and on February 14, the first cases of death occurred outside of Asia in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were reported outside of China, Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica reported deaths. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region, and are affected by monitoring, health system quality, treatment programs, the first outbreak of the epidemic time and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health conditions. The death rate is the number of deaths during the given time period divided by the number of diagnoses.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, global mortality rate is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The death rate varies from region to region.
In China, the morbidity rate estimates declined from 17.3% to 0.7% (for patients with onsets from 1st to 10th January 2020) (after 1st February 2020). Several other measurement criteria also included cases mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflected the percentage of the number of people who die from illness who were identified as being the percentage of the number of diagnoses, which reflected the percentage of the number of people who die from disease who were infected (including the number of diagnoses and the number of people who did not know).
These statistics are not limited in time, and are tracked throughout the process of a specific population being solved from an infection to a case.
Many scholars try to calculate the above data for a specific population.
According to the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, the overall infection mortality rate of the epidemic ranged between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimated value of the range meets the first randomized detection of COVID-19 in Germany, as well as a statistical analysis of the effects of the tests on CFR valuations.
The World Health Organization claimed that the pandemic was controllable.
The peak and maximum duration of the eruption can be determined and vary depending on the region.
Maciej Boni from Pennsylvania State University pointed out: 'If it is not controlled, the outbreak of infectious diseases will usually be in the existing host after the shutdown period, and then start to follow the relief.
But at the moment we are almost impossible to reasonably predict when the points will appear.”
The Chinese government's senior medical consultant Qiannanshan believes that if all the countries start, the world health organization adopted measures to stop the spread of the virus, then "the end of June epidemic can be expected."
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 “is likely to burst repeatedly and lasts one to two years.”
Neil Ferguson’s research conducted at the Imperial College of Technology has shown that “before the vaccine is in use (it may take 18 months or longer)”, it is important to take steps to maintain physical distance and other measures.
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said: "This coronavirus spread is very strong, I think it is unlikely to disappear completely," "may evolve into a seasonal disease, once a year." 」
The pathogenic force of the outbreak again depends on the level of immunity and mutations in the group.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-attractive, and some infected people may be asymptomatic.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and cough (68%).
Symptoms of abnormal symptoms include fatigue, respiratory septic fluid (septic), loss, stimulant, stimulant, muscle and joint pain, throat, pain, cold, cheek, cheek, diarrhea or hair. According to the World Health Organization, about one in six patients will be diagnosed as serious and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) treats respiratory distress, chest pain or stress, blurred unexpectedly, dazzling to awake and the lip or lip hair glaucoma as a critical emergency. If these symptoms are present, it is recommended that you immediately seek medical attention. The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular disease, infectious shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical performance, but the test results are sexually present, so researchers suggest close observations and investigations of patients with confirmed patients, excluding the possible infection.
China estimates that the percentage of people living with an asymptomatic disease ranges from as low as 44%.
The opportunistic period (between the time of infection) is usually 1-14 days; 5 days most often. Regarding uncertainty, one example can be used to illustrate: the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who have lost their family members was initially estimated at 30% and then down to 15%.
Some details about the path of the patient have not been determined yet.
Currently, it is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted through close proximity and the likeness of cough, tear or talking; close proximity is within 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) of the interval.
Studies have found that unoccupied coughs could lead to the most distant release of droplets 4.5 m (15 ft) -8.2 m (15-27 ft).
It has also been suggested that the droplets generated when people speak in the air stay for a long time may also result in the transmission of the virus. Although the virus usually cannot be transmitted through the air, people may also produce droplets in the weather or when they speak.
This droplet may fall into the surrounding mouth nose, even into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as ducts and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory discharges, resulting in airborne transmission.
In addition, if a person touches the surface (including skins) contaminated with the virus, and then touches their own mouths, it may also lead to the spread of the virus.
There are also people who are confident that the virus may be transmitted through greedy, but this risk is considered to be low.
Whether the Chinese government has identified the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 greedy spread. This virus is the most contagious three days before the onset, but it is also contagious before and after the onset.
It is possible to detect sore results as early as three days before the onset, suggesting that COVID-19 is already infectious before manifestations appear.
Although there are few reports of cases of asymptomatic indications identified in the laboratory, some countries have discovered the phenomenon of asymptomatic infections in the course of conducting contact tracing investigations.
The European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) says that the transmission power of the virus is not yet fully clear, but that generally 1 person will infect 2-3 people. The virus survives on the surface of the object for a few hours to a few days.
Specifically, it is known that COVID-19 can survive up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on a cardboard, and up to four hours on a mold.
However, its survival time has also been influenced by humidity and temperature. There are currently cases where pet and other animals have been tested for COVID-19.
There is currently no evidence that the virus will be transmitted to humans by animals, but the British official agency also recommends that people wash their hands after touching animals, like connecting with other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that is first separated from 3 pneumonia patients with a batch of acute respiratory diseases in martial art.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presented in nature-related coronaviruses. The virus can be burned with household soap before it enters the human body, as it can dissolve the virus's protective pills.
It is currently regarded as animal related diseases.
This coronary virus has been shown to be a cluster of β archaeological Sarbecovirus aquariums (B-Clo) and two types of bats-borne strain.
The corona is up to 96% consistent with other BatCov RatG13s at the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that the virus in the pangolin body is only one amino acid in certain parts of the genetic sequence with the virus in the human body.
As of today’s full-genome comparison, up to 92% of pangolin- crown virus and SARS-CoV-2 have the same minerals, and it is not enough to prove that pangolin is the middle host.
Whether or not the virus can be diagnosed based on the symptoms, but the last thing is to confirm the diagnosis by the inverse transcription of the infected secretion, the polymerase reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A PCR vs. CT comparison study conducted in martial arts shows that CTs are significantly more sensitive to PCRs, but with less speciality, many imaging features will reconcile with other pneumonia and disease development processes.
As of March 2020, the American Society of Radiology recommends that “CT is not intended to be used to check for COVID-19 or as the first test for diagnosing the disease.”
The World Health Organization has now announced several nucleic acid testing solutions for SARS-CoV-2, the first one to be released on 17 January.
The nucleic acid test uses real-time reverse transcription enzyme response (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory sample or thrombosis can be used for testing.
Results can generally be obtained from a few hours to a few days.
Generally speaking, this detection is performed by a nasal swab, or by a swab. Many laboratories and companies are developing tests for serum learning to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these testing methods are sufficiently accurate and cannot be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, the Serum Test by Cellex has been approved for use only in emergency situations by certified laboratories.
Typical imaging characteristics of X-pieces and computer looming scans (CT) in patients with incidences include peripheral grinding glass shadow disproportionately and chestless cassette.
The Italian Institute of Radiology is tracking the image performance of confirmed cases in an international online database.
Due to the reconstitution of other virus infections, such as adenovirus, images that are not confirmed by PCR have limited speciality in determining COVID-19.
A large study in China comparing the results of chest CT to PCR results found that although images are less likely to identify infections, they are faster and more sensitive to detect, so it is possible to consider them as a means of investigation in popular areas.
The AI-based scroll neural network has been developed that can be used to detect the image characteristics of the virus using X tablets and CTs together.
Measures to prevent the spread of disease include good personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding hand washing directly touching the mouth, coughing or scarring the mouth at any time, using the scarf towel directly into the trash can.
Medical surgical masks should be worn by people who are suspected to be infected when entering public places.
In addition, it is recommended to take measures to maintain a physical distance to prevent the spread of the virus. Many governments have restricted or recommended to avoid going to and from countries and regions affected by the epidemic if they are not required.
However, the virus has reached a stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that viruses are being disseminated in the community, and some community residents do not know where they are or how to get infected. Health care personnel who are suspected of being infected should take standard precautions, contact prevention measures and eye protection.
The government uses mobile phone location data for tracking purposes to trigger people’s concerns about privacy, Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations to make a statement, calling on such supervision to limit.
There are currently a variety of mobile applications that have been put into use or entered into proposals for people to use. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts are working on solutions with privacy protection features, such as the distance between using Bluetooth to record users and other phones.
Users will receive informational alerts once they have been closely connected to patients with COVID-19 test results.
There are currently no COVID-19 vaccines, but many organizations are actively researching.
Do recommend hand washing to stop the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially if they have stains after a bay, before a stain, and after a nasolabial stain, cough, or scare.
This is because the virus can be used only with household soap before entering the human body to break down its protective pills and thus play a role in recovering the virus.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that if you have no soap and tap water, you can wash your hands with alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth without washing their hands.
Multi-solution disinfection can be used on the surface of the object (sterilization solution can take effect within a minute of no calcium), including 62-71 percent ethanol, 50-100% ethanol, 0.1% chlorine, 0.5% POL and 0.2-7.5% polyvinyl ester.
Other solutions (such as chlorine chloride and chlorine self-determined glucose acid) have poor effects.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends that if there are suspected cases or confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in facilities such as offices or daycare facilities, they should be disinfected in all areas, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controllers and automated dispensers used by patients.
The Health Organization recommends people to use a curled elbow or scarf to put their mouths on a cough or scarf, and immediately treat all contaminated scarves.
It is recommended that infected people wear medical surgical masks, because wearing masks can reduce the amount of freezing and sending distances when they speak, sneezing, and coughing.
The World Health Organization has published explanations about the use of face masks and how to use them.
According to Stephen Griffin, a viral scientist at the University of Leeds, "wearing masks can reduce the orientation of people touching, and in the case of inaccessible hand health, touching is also a major source of infection." In addition, it is also recommended to take a mask for people who are suspected of taking care of people who are infected.
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people only need masks in high-risk areas, such as those in patients with COVID-19 who take care of them, but the organization also recommends that masks help avoid strokes.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. It is clear in China that healthy citizens are also recommended to wear disposable medical masks, especially if they are within a range of (1 m (3 ft) and close to others.
Hong Kong, China recommends wearing a mask when riding public transport or entering crowd-intensive places.
Thai health officials recommend people to self-made masks and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are restricted from masking or masking or masking into public places.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask to enter public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government stipulates that all people are required to wear a face mask to enter the grocery store.
Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.
Since mid-March, Taiwan has produced 1,000 million masks, and on April 1, it began requiring masks to be worn by trains and inter-city buses.
Panama stipulates that masks must be worn when going out, and that residents who do not have masks are recommended to self-made masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Infection prevention and control measures related to social distance (also known as physical distance) are designed to reduce the number of close connections between people, thereby reducing the spread of disease.
Measures include isolation; travel restrictions; suspension, shutdown, and closing of stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
When it comes to social distancing, measures that individuals can take include staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowd-intensive areas, switching to non-contacting greetings, and maintaining physical distance with others.
Many governments have now enforced requirements or recommended to maintain a social distance in areas affected by the pandemic.
The initial suggestion of the U.S. government agency and health organization about the size of the largest population gathering was 250 people (in areas without COVID-19 spread), quickly reduced to 50 people, and later reduced to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, German public gatherings for two or more people are prohibited. Elderly people and groups with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and immune system are more likely to suffer from severe illness and complications. The German Center for Disease Control recommended that such groups of people living in epidemic areas may not go out. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began to replace the practice of "Keep Physical Distance" to clarify that the purpose is to reduce physical access, while still maintaining social contact, including contact and distance.
The use of "stay social distance" grammar contains the meaning that requires people to be completely isolated from society, and there is no encouragement that people to use other ways to maintain the connection between people. Some authorities also publish the applicable sexual health guidance during the pandemic.
One of the recommendations includes sexual relationships only with companions who live with and who are not infected with viruses or asymptomatic symptoms.
COVID-19 testimonials for self-isolation in the home of patients and suspected infected persons.
The health authorities have published detailed instructions on correct self-isolation. Many governments have forced or recommended that all residents of the epidemic areas self-isolation.
In addition, the most serious self-isolation instruction has been released to high-risk people.
If you have been admitted to a COVID-19 patient, or if you have recently been in a country or region where the virus is likely to be admitted, you will be advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time it was finally possible to receive it.
Anti-epidemic strategies include containment/ suppression and relief.
The curb applies to the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and segregation of infected persons while taking other infection prevention and control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of disease to other people.
If it is no longer able to curb the spread of disease, should try to transition to the relief phase: take measures to reduce the spread of disease, reduce the impact of disease on the health system and society.
containment and relief measures can be carried out at the same time.
Suppression of the need to take more extreme prevention and control measures, by reducing the basic number of regeneration to less than 1 to reverse the situation of the pandemic. Controlling some of the work of the outbreak is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, that is, we know the pulling epidemiological curve.
This reduces the crash of the hierarchical service system and takes more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programs.
Non-drug interventions that can control the epidemic include personal preventive measures such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-isolation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspension and cancellation of mass assembly activities; aims to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and surface cleaning and other environmental measures. In the face of a severe epidemic, China has taken more stringent epidemic containment measures such as lockdowns and implementation of strict travel bans.
Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Korea introduced large-scale inspection and local isolation measures, and issued a warning about the activities of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for self-quarantine infections, with huge amounts of money for those who refuse to self-quarantine.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and imposed significant challenges to suppliers of sparingly sold medical supplies. The simulations of the United Kingdom and the United States have shown that relief (sustaining but stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppressing (distorting the spread of epidemics) are significant challenges.
The best relief policy may reduce the peak medical demand by 2/3, reducing the number of deaths by half, but still causing tens of thousands of deaths, causing a collapse of the health system.
Suppression may be a preferred measure, but it is necessary to maintain the virus in the population to stop transmission (or until the vaccine is launched, first-come-first-served), otherwise, once the measures are relaxed, the transmission will quickly rebel.
A long-term intervention aimed at suppressing the pandemic brings social and economic costs.
There are currently no COVID-19 approved special effects antiviral drugs, but R&D efforts are still in progress, including trials of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, saliva and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen, cirrhosis and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may result in the deterioration of the situation.
Several compounds previously awarded to treat other viral diseases are currently being studied to determine if they are suitable for treating COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also notes that some “traditional and family remedies” can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization pointed out that improving processing power and tuning the medical system to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic epidemic response.
ECDC and the World Health Organization European Regional Office published the guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for transfer of resources across multiple levels, including centralized laboratory services in COVID-19 testing, as well as potentially removing selective procedures, separating and segregation of COVID-19 sore patients, as well as improving critical care by training staff and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
Guessing lying around the origin of the first case (i.e. patients with zero number).
The first known case of coronavirus pneumonia may be dated back to December 1, 2019 in Hubei, China.
Within a month, cases of the new coronavirus in Hubei Province have increased.
Most of these patients are related to the South China Sea wholesale market, the market also sells live animals, a theory that the novel coronavirus is derived from some of the animals, or words, originating from a common disorder. December 26, Hubei province, the central and western hospital combined with the hospital's medical doctor first discovered and harvested a number of unknown causes of pneumonia patients, and reported on December 27th to the Wuhua Jianghui District Disease Prevention and Prevention Control Center.
On December 30, a group of doctors in the Wu Hwa Center Hospital reminded their colleagues to be wary of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight doctors, including Li Wen-Leung, were accused by the police for spreading the “proverbs”, and another doctor, Aifen, was interviewed by the upper level for his proclamation for a pullback warning.
Following the announcement of the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee on December 31, it was reported to the World Health Organization.
In early January, the martial law sector began a investigation after receiving reports of pneumonia cases of many unknown causes. In the early days of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half.

There is a panic shopping phenomenon in many places, causing food on the shelf, toilet and bottled water and other necessities are emptied, resulting in shortages of supply.
Especially the science and technology industry has been warning of the proliferation of electronic products.
The World Health Organization's Total Division, DeSse said that the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
This demand has caused the price of this product to be up to 20 times higher than usual, and the supply of medical supplies has also been delayed from 4 to 6 months,
There is also a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide. The World Health Organization warns that this will lead to a threat to medical staff.
In Australia, the pandemic provided new opportunities for purchasers to sell Australian products to China.
This activity has led to a shortage of some supermarkets in the Bhetto formula, which is banned by the Australian government. While COVID-19 in northern Italy and in the martial arts region is very heavy, there are no heavy food shortages in both.
The measures taken by China and Italy on key products and illegal trade practices are very successful, to avoid serious food shortages, while Europe and North America are expected to present such problems.
The agricultural production in northern Italy has not dropped sharply, but the industry represents that prices may rise.
Food shelf emptying is just a momentous occurrence, even in the case of martial law, the Chinese government officials have released a rampant meat reserve to protect the fullness of the residents.
Italy also has similar laws requiring food producers to prepare for supply in such an emergency.
The global economy has been impacted by China: a media report on March 16 said that two months ago, affected by the government's measures to curb the epidemic, the Chinese economy suffered a huge curtailment, and retail fell by 20.5%.
Because China is the world's leading economic and manufacturing center, the virus outbreak is regarded as a major threat to global economic stability.
According to the Agathe Demarais forecast from the Economist Intelligence Unit, the market will remain unfixed until there is a clearer understanding of possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the outbreak could have had a negative impact on global economic growth more than the 2002-2004 pandemic.
An expert at the University of St. Louis estimated that the pandemic’s impact on global supply chains will reach over $3,000 and last two years.
Oil Export Organization (OPEC) “is difficult to handle” oil prices after a sharp decline in oil prices, reports.
On February 24, the global stock market dropped due to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside of China.
On February 27, the U.S. stock market indices, including the Nasdaq 100 Index, the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, have all seen the largest decline since 2008, with the Dow Jones falling by 1,191 points, the largest single-day decline since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
The three major indices fell more than 10% on the week average.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the dominant credit rating in China, but still maintained the outlook.
The popularity of COVID-19 has caused the stock market to plummet again, with the largest drop appearing on March 16.
Multi-party economic recession is thought to be a probabilistic event.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian said the central banks and states have taken timely emergency measures.
Central banks responded faster compared to the 2008 financial crisis.
The tourism industry has become one of the most significant industries affected by the travel ban, tourist attractions and other public places, as well as the government's recommendations to avoid the impact of travel.
Due to this impact, many airlines cancelled flights due to a drop in demand, including British Airways (UK), China Eastern and Qantas, while British Airways (UK) Flybe was unfortunate.
It’s never been more important to be a part of the dating industry.
Multiple train stations and ferry ports are also forced to shut down.
The pandemic coincides with the Chinese New Year holiday, which was originally an important tourist season.
National and local governments to cancel a series of activities involving crowd gathering, including the annual Spring Festival, private enterprises also shut down the shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year activities and tourist attractions (including Beijing Tribune and traditional meetings) are always canceled and shut down to prevent large-scale crowds from gathering.
Of the 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China, 24 regions have extended their New Year holidays to February 10, requiring most businesses to resume before that date.
The GDP of these regions accounts for 80% of the country and 90% of the exports.
Hong Kong, China has raised the level of infection response to the highest, and announced the entry into urgent situation, school closures until March, New Year greetings canceled. The retail industry is affected by the global impact, the store business hours are short or time-off.
Europe and Latin America saw a 40% decline in the amount of light in retail stores.
Retail stores in North America and the Middle East dropped by 50-60%.
In addition, the pandemic has also resulted in a 33-34% drop in customer traffic in March compared to February.
Mall operators around the world have taken extra measures, such as increasing sanitation, installing hot scans to measure the shopper’s body temperature, and also canceled some activities. According to the estimates of the United Nations Latin American Economic Commission, the pandemic-induced economic recession may lead to a 1,400 million to 2,200 million more significant population in Latin America than it did not have a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 500 million people were unemployed during the peak of the martial law pandemic in China.
There are nearly 3 migrant workers in China, many of which have been left in domestic or Hubei provinces. In March 2020, more than 1,000 Americans were unemployed and have applied for government assistance.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to 4,700 unemployment in the U.S., and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The lockdown in India has led to thousands of unemployment (paid by day) Indian migrant workers. The Angersrid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households experienced some form of unemployment.
In the second half of March, 400 French workers applied for temporary unemployment relief, 100 British workers applied for general benefits. Nearly 50 companies in Germany have adopted a temporary work system by the government.
France and the United Kingdom have also adopted Germany's transitory work system.
The entertainment and cultural industry has also been reinvented due to the epidemic, and the global organization of operations and employees and individuals have not been honored.
The art and culture industry organization works hard to adhere to its mission (often funded by government), to showcase cultural properties to the community, to maintain the safety of its employees and the public, and as far as possible to support artists.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theaters and other cultural institutions around the world are closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and original exhibitions, events and performances are also forced to be cancelled or postponed.
In response to this situation, all parties began to vigorously provide alternative services through the digital platform. In recent times, the epidemic has caused many religious services, major sports and other social activities (such as music festivals, concerts, technical seminars and fashion shows) to be forced to be canceled, and this impact will be quickly increased.
The film industry has been struck. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week event that will be held in Rome in the last week of the Christian Tertiary.
Many parishioners recommend older Christians to stay at home, and worship days do not have to participate in parishioners; some churches conduct worship through radio, live streaming or television, while others allow for worship in the car.
The Roman Catholic Pipe shut down its small church and St. Peter's Square did not see a Christian pilgrim trace, and other religious groups also removed or limited the blasphemy or limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, dynasty churches, temples, and hype.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers from affected areas affected by the epidemic, and the coming of the Holy Land was forced to shut down, and Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the Holy Land of Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic has caused the world’s biggest disruption since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events are forced to be cancelled or promoted, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 National Hockey League season.
The outbreak was scheduled for the 2020 Summer Olympics program scheduled for the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until the end of 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021." The casinos and other gaming venues around the world were closed and live poker games were also forced to roll or cancel.
This led to a lot of bloggers turning to online gambling, and multiple online gambling websites reported an increase in their new registration rate. The entertainment industry has also been influenced, and various music groups have stopped or canceled the tour concert.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway theaters, have also stumbled on all the performances.
Some artists also try to create and share artworks through the Internet, instead of traditional live performances, such as live concerts, or create a network "festive" for artists to perform, distribute, and promote their works.
On the Internet, many people start to turn to humorous and distracting ways to respond to the situation of indeterministic spread of the new coronavirus-themed network obsession.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been increasing biases, xenophobia and racial discrimination among the Chinese, East Asian and the people from Europe, the United States and other countries.
Many countries and regions, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia Pacific, are experiencing panic, suspicion, and hostility.
In February, many reports (though most of the cases are still limited to China) recorded the racism of different groups in the world to the Chinese people, it is believed that the Chinese should be infected with the virus or accept the correct response.
Some African countries have also appeared anti-war rising phenomenon.
Many residents in the martial arts and Hubei regions are subjected to territorial discrimination, according to reports.
Whether online or online, there are voices that support the Chinese people and the people of the most affected areas of the epidemic.
With the spread of the epidemic to other hot countries, Italy became the first country in Europe to have a severe outbreak of COVID-19, and the population from the country may also be affected by doubts and xenophobia. Some citizens of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and other countries initially signed a request to ban the Chinese from entering their country in order to try to stop the spread of disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan (Chinese is from Japan) issue launched on Twitter by some people.
The Chinese, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported an increase in racial abuse and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for claiming the novel coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", critics of which there is racial discrimination and anti-war direction.
The Ukrainian defeators slew a bus from martial arts to the new Sanzari, with Ukrainian and foreign evacuators.
Students from northeast India (and China border) who read in major Indian cities have also been struck by the outbreak of the new coronavirus.
“So God wants to revenge them,” said Dilip Gosh, president of the Indian people’s West Bengal.
These remarks were later criticized by the Chinese government in Kolkata, China, called its “false”. In China, non-Chinese residents are also subjected to xenophobia and racial discrimination due to the pandemic, and foreigners are described as “gloves of foreign countries,” and should be the goal of “rubbish treatment”.
Many reports with a paycheck have canceled the chargeback limit for some or all of the reports about the new coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers publicly published paper on some epidemic-related science.
Some scientists choose to quickly share their research results on pre-printed servers such as bioRxiv.

2019 The laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include: detecting the presence or absence of the virus and detecting the presence of antibodies after infection.
RT-PCR detects the RNA of the coronavirus and determines whether the virus is present in the sample.
This detection is a speculative detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
Can be used to determine if there is a recent infection or an active infection.
Antibody detection (serum test) can be used for diagnostic and group monitoring.
Antibody detection shows how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with minimal symptoms without reports or asymptomatic symptoms.
The results of this test determine the precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of group immunity in the population.
As of March 2020, no country can provide reliable data on the popularity of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, there is no one country to measure more than 3% of its population, and the measurement differences are huge across countries.
Such a difference may also seriously affect the reported case mortality rate, which may be overvalued in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription enzyme response (rRT-PCR) detection using a throat swab can only be achieved with reliable results within the first week of the virus infection.
In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR testing with a scoop can only result in reliable results within the first week of the virus infection.
After that, the virus disappears in the throat, but continues to breed in the lungs.
For an infected person who detects the second week after infection, the sample can be substituted as a deep respiratory extract obtained through the straw, or the use of cough excretion (septic fluid).
The rRT-PCR was released in January 2020 at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, one of the early PCR tests and became the basis for 250,000 test boxes distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 23, 2020, a test method was also developed in the United Kingdom. On January 28, 2020, Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a type of clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test box (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It searches for all the ‘E’ genes shared by the β Coronavirus virus and the RDRp genes unique to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group was one of the first to obtain approval from the China National Drug Administration for the emergency use of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits.
An early version of the test box used three gene test methods, one of which was unable to determine the results due to the test defects, and, at the same time, the Atlanta CDC showed a test bottle; this resulted in the average number of samples successfully processed every day of February 2020, under 100.
Two parts of the test until February 28, 2020 were determined to be reliable, at which point the state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. The U.S. Commercial Laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp has announced that it will be able to conduct RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing across the national range starting March 5, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics also announced a national COVID-19 test available from March 9, 2020.
The limit on the number of undeclared; sample collection and processing must be performed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing was developed and produced by the National Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research (VECTOR).
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Federal Health Supervision Bureau of the Russian Federation. On March 12, 2020, Mayo found a test box to detect COVID-19 infections. On March 13, 2020, a Roche Diagnostics test method was approved by the FDA, which completed extensive testing within 3.5 hours, enabling a device to be tested approximately 4,128 times in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA released an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Abbott m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories; the FDA previously issued similar licenses to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, one of Cepheid’s testing methods required about 45 minutes to get an FDA’s emergency use authorization.
The FDA has approved a testing method that uses nucleic acid and other temperature-incrementing techniques to replace PCRs.
Since the method does not require a series of temperature cycles, the results can be determined in just 5 minutes, and the results can be determined in 13 minutes.
The United States currently has approximately 18,000 units, and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a detection method that uses monoclonal antibodies (which are specifically combined with the novel coronavirus’s nuclear clonal protein (N-protein)) to provide tests within 15 to 20 minutes of rapid flu detection.
A March 2020 review of the essay concluded the conclusion, "In the early stages of the virus, the diagnosis of the chest is small, and the performance of CT [computer scan] may be very obvious, even before the symptoms appear"
Typical features of CT include double pulmonary multi-grind glass shadows, with peripheral non-contrast and rear parts.
As the disease progresses, it will develop the underlying diaphragm, the crushing path, and the pulmonary process of the brass.
A study by PCR and CT, a comparison of martial arts (where the initial outbreak of the current pandemic) has shown that CTs are much more sensitive than PCR, but CTs are much less precise, with many of its imaging characteristics with other pneumonia and disease heavy.
As of March 2020, the American Society of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to check for COVID-19 or as a first-line test tool for diagnosing COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC recommends using PCR for initial inspections.
Some of the immune responses to infections are antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections for about 7 days after the start of the disease to determine the immune condition of the monitored population. It is determined that can be performed in a central laboratory (CLT) or via a real-time test (PoCT).
Many of the high-throughput automated systems in the clinical laboratory can be measured above, but their availability depends on the productivity of each system.
For CLT, it is still possible to track the immune response by serial sample, but it usually uses a peripheral hemorrhoid sample for determination.
For PoCT, skin piercing is generally used to obtain a blood sample.
There is no need to do the extraction step before the determination, which is different from the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the test methods for 29 entity declarations, which are now able to distribute their antibody test case.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one test based on its Emergency Use Authorization. In late March 2020, the test kits of Oumon Medical Trials Inc. and Epitope Diagnostics were approved in Europe, and these test boxes can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The ability to detect hundreds of samples within hours, so on the detection of virus RNA, it is much faster than traditional PCR tests.
In general, the antibody can be detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that in its purchased antibody test box, there is no sufficiently useful.
Hong Kong has established a mechanism for patients who are suspected to be able to live, 'emergency room to provide patients with sample tubes', the patient will be hydrated into the tube, and then the tube will be sent back, and the results will be received later. British NHS announced that it is to test a case at home solution for suspected cases, which can eliminate the patient's risk of infection to other people when they go to the hospital, but also eliminate the risk of disinfection of ambulances after the patient uses a ambulance.
In Germany, the national Statutory Health Insurance Medical Association said on March 2 that non-hospital institutions have the ability to carry out about 12,000 tests per day, and 10,700 tests were detected last week.
If the doctor is required to test, the cost of the fee is covered by the health insurance.
Germany’s total weekly testing capacity is 160,000, according to the director of the Robert Koch Institute.
As of March 19th, it has been offered free off-the-road inspection in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of people tested in Germany has not known, as reported only the number of people who tested results as sober.
An initial lab survey showed that as of week 12, 2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples were detected (including week 12, 2020), and 33,491 samples were detected (6.9%) SARS-CoV-2 was reported. In Israel, the researchers at Technion and Ramblas Hospital developed and tested a method used to detect 64-bit patient samples, i.e., total samples, and were only further tested when the combined samples were discovered as times.
The lab was built 5 days under the supervision of the great genetic founder, model showed that if it did not reach the above detection capacity, the cases of Hubei will be 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment isolation costs will be doubled.
After the Qiuwu Rhen Lab, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately meet to establish a fire-eye laboratory, there are currently 12 cities in China to establish the laboratory.
By March 4, 2020, laboratory testing day throughput totals 50,000 per day. Origami Assays published an open-source, multi-way design that enables COVID19 testing for up to 1122 patient samples only with 93 determinations. These balanced designs can be run in small labs without the need for an automatic transmission.
As of March, the shortage of tests and insufficient quantities have become a barrier to large-scale testing in the EU, the UK, and the US.
This led some promoters to explore the synthesis planning program, which involved heating the sample up to 98 °C (208 °F) up to 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates announced that it has now tested more of its more population than any other country, and is testing the level to allow a large number of people to undergo the test.
The method to achieve this detection capability is that on the one hand, the use of drive-through detection, and on the other hand the Group 42 and the Greater genes (based on its "fire-eye" emergency detection laboratory in China) have invested in creating a high-throughput laboratory for the detection needs of large-scale populations.
Built within 14 days, the lab is able to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day, making it the world’s first such a scale laboratory operating outside of China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different testing methods for various parts of the coronavirus gene map.
The World Health Organization adopted the German production test box method, to develop its own test box for low-income countries without resources to send test box.
Germany’s approach has been announced on January 17, 2020; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans are available after January 28, limiting U.S. testing capabilities. Both China and the United States encountered issues with testing for the reliability of the box early in the outbreak, both countries and Australia were unable to provide adequate test boxes to meet demand and health expert recommendations.
On the contrary, experts believe that the widespread detection of South Korea is very helpful in reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Since the government of South Korea has established in the last few years the detection ability, which is mainly concentrated in the laboratories of the private sector.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an additional testing program, as the best way to reduce the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to a very large demand for testing, which led to the tens of thousands of tests in private lab rooms in the United States, and the supply of swabs and chemistry tests has also begun to grow.
In March 2020, China reported the accuracy of its test arsenal.
In the United States, the CDC-developed test box has a "flaw"; as a result, the government eliminated the bureaucratic damage of blocking private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test box from Chinese company Shenzhen Yirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd., to find the test results are inaccurate.
The company explained that the test results were inaccurate and may not be the result of incorrect collection of samples or misused using the test box.
In Spain, it was reported that it would return the test box to the test box of the error and provide another test box for Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test boxes purchased from the Czech Republic were incorrect. Slovakia purchased 120 million test boxes from China and the results were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič recommends that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara from the Turkish Department of Health says that Turkey purchases a test box from China that “probability rate is high” and that there is no “convenient use of them.” The UK purchases 350+ test boxes from China, announced in April 2020 that these test boxes were unavailable.
Detect and isolate and track the connection history of SARS-CoV-2 pneumatic personnel with the results of the test.
Researchers working in the city of Vò, Italy’s first COVID-19 patient’s deadland, conducted two tests for a total of about 3,400 people, each separated for about ten days.
About half of them detect sore and asymptomatic symptoms, and all cases found are isolated.
By taking restrictions on the community, it completely eliminates the new infection.
Through mass tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry travel, testing and segregation, the 2020 Covid-19 infection in Singapore is slowly slower than in other developed countries, and Singapore has no extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail locations.
Many events have been canceled in Singapore, and residents are recommended to stay home on March 28, but the school will be rescheduled on March 23 after the holidays.
Several other countries, including Ireland and South Korea, have also controlled the pandemic through mass tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry travel, testing and isolation, and less aggressive lockdown measures.
A statistical study found that compared to the number of deaths, the more measured countries, the lower the mortality rates, the reason may be that these countries are better able to detect only micro-symptomatic or asymptomatic populations.
WHO recommends countries with limited experience in testing capacity and state-level laboratory handling COVID-19, will have their first five exposed and top ten exposed COVID-19 specimens, to be sent to one of the 16 WHO reference labs for confirmation.
Of these 16 reference labs, 7 are located in Asia, 5 are located in Europe, 2 are located in Africa, 1 is located in North America, and 1 is located in Australia.
In the following chart, the 'detect propagation %' column is affected by the country's detection policy.
In the same case as other conditions, it is higher than that of countries that detect all citizens (regardless of whether symptoms have been observed), which detect the inpatient’s country, whose rate of fluency is higher.
Washing hands, also known as hand cleansing, is to clean hands in order to remove the soil, grease, microorganisms or other useless substances in the hands.
Washing hands with soap can prevent the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and Horoscope, in some “offset moments” every day, and these diseases can be spread through greed – oral.
If people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common cold.
When you wash your hands with soap during the day: before and after your boweling, after cleaning your child’s buttocks or diapers, before and after feeding your child, before and after serving your child, or before and after dealing with raw meat, fish or poultry.
Without soap and water, you can clean your hands with grass ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands in the following situations:
Before, during and after food preparation.
Take care of the patient before and after.
Replace the diapers or cleanse the hips of the child.
After snoring, coughing, or sneeling.
After touching animals, animal food or animals.
Medical staff hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Wash your hands before making a medical treatment, preventing or minimizing the spread of disease.
In the medical area, the main purpose of hand washing is to remove the pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause diseases) and chemical substances that may harm the human body or cause diseases in your hand.
For those who work in food processing or in the medical field, hand washing is especially important, but for the public, hand washing is also a very important practice.
Washing hands has many benefits to health, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce the mortality rate of the childbirth at home.
A 2013 study showed that improving the height of hand washing in children under the age of five had a slight boost.
In developing countries, by advocating for simple behavior changes (e.g. washing your hands with soap), you can reduce the mortality rate associated with respiratory and diarrhea diseases.
This simple behavior reduces the death rate of the above-mentioned diseases by nearly 50%.
This intervention can reduce the occurrence of about one-third of diarrhea, which is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap reduces diarrhea by 48%. Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) as self-disciplined in families, schools and communities around the world.
As a major acute respiratory infection, pneumonia is the leading cause of the death of children under five years old, and pneumonia travels around 180 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause nearly 350 children to die each year.
In contrast to any single vaccine or medical intervention, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNFHK) said that washing hands with soap into entrenched eruptions could save more lives, reducing the death caused by diarrhea by nearly half, reducing deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter of the deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
As part of the Water, Environmental Hygiene, and Personal Health (WASH) project, other hygiene interventions are usually taken while promoting hand washing.
Handwashers can also prevent seizures that are transmitted directly through the body.
Washing hands will lead to a slight unfavorable effect that frequent hand washing will cause dry skin, which causes skin damage.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing would lead to skin scarring, cracking, known as hand rash or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also one of the symptoms of obsessive disorder (OCD).
In order to reduce the spread of the disease, it is important to wash your hands with soap during the day of the five key moments: after a testament (urination, bowel), after a clean child's buttocks (more diapers), before feeding the child, before and after the food, or after dealing with raw meat, grain or poultry.
In order to prevent the spread of disease, in the following cases, you should also use the right way to wash your hands: to deal with incisions or lips before and after; to scare, cough or wipe away; to touch animal stool or to handle animals; and after encountering garbage.
Washing hands with soap is low in many countries.
A study in 2015 on the condition of hand washing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A study in 2014 showed that the highest percentage of Saudi Arabia was 97%; the U.S. approached the average, that is 77%; the lowest percentage of China, was 23%.
The Philippine Ministry of Education to promote the 'Basic Health Care Plan' is to take large scale initiatives of a paradigm to improve the health and education of children.
At the heart of this national program is two times a year, wash your hands with soap daily and brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste.
In Indonesia, this program has also been successfully implemented.
Infused into water with soap or cleansing, the microorganisms on the skin can be better removed.
The main role of soap and cleansing is to reduce soluble obstructions and improve solubility.
Only water can not effectively cleanse skin because fats and proteins (the composition of organic soil) are not easily dissolved in water.
However, cleaning hands requires a reasonable use of water...
Solid soaps may be kept for germs that were left during previous use as they can be reused.
There are small studies that investigate the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap, and the conclusion is that bacteria can not be transferred, because bacteria will be washed out by foam.
But the CDC still claims "the best option to use non-informed liquid soaps".
Antibacterial soap has been vigorously promoted in the larger war with healthy minds.
Until now, there is no evidence that antibiotics tolerant microbes in nature have been chosen using recommended antibacterial practices or sanitizing practices.
However, the antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial processes such as sand, which have a large number of antibacterial microorganisms.
Therefore, antibacterial soap may not be effective even if it is not chosen for antibiotic-tolerant strains.
In addition to surfacting and skincare, complex formulations may also contain acid (acetic acid, serotonic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobial activity beanic acid, and more skincare treatments (feminine, vitamins, mint, phytosanitol, plant extract). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the School of Public Health at Oregon concluded that in preventing disease and removing bacteria from your hands, common soap is one after another with the effect of sanctuary-grade antimicrobial soap containing three chlorine sand.
Washing the hot water is comfortable, but its heat is not enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria breed quickly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, when it comes to the removal of natural greases containing soil and germs, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water.
Scientific studies have proven that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the microorganisms at hand, which is contrary to the prevailing viewpoint.
Water-free hand sanitiser or hands-free wash water is purified by non-water-based hand.
In the late 1990s and early 21st centuries, non-water based alcohol hand cleansing (also known as alcohol hand sanitizer, hands-free and hands-free).
This type of hand sanitizer is mostly formulated with pyrosyl alcohol or ethanol, and then contains a thickening gel such as a capom (acrylic polymer), or a moisturizing liquid such as glycerin, or foaming for easy use, and dissolves from the drying of the skin caused by alcohol.
Extra antibacterial activity can be further increased by adding helium peroxide after melting. Washing hands with at least 60% to 95% alcohol can only be effective in germs.
Alcohol hand sanitizers can kill germs, polyurethane-resistant bacteria (MRSA) and anti-quadryl myophylococcus aureus (VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cytokine virus (RSV), nasolabiosis, septic, influenza and hepatitis), and fungi.
70% of alcohol-based hand sanitizers use 99.97% of bacteria that can kill hands after 30 seconds (reduced by 3.5 min, similar to reduced by 35 min) and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 min) of the hand after 1 minute of hand removal. Washing hand sanitizer is most effective for bacteria, while slightly less effective for some viral processes.
Alcohol hand sanitizers have little to no effect on viruses such as Norovirus (now known as Norwalk) (the most common cause of infectious gastrophitis). It is important to use enough hands-free germs or alcohol hand sanitizer to squeeze or cover your hand.
Wash your heart and back as well as your fingers and all fingers end for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or clotting dry.
The fingers must be fully washed, and washed in the palm of your hand. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the best way to wash your hands instead of using hands-free hand sanitizers, especially when it appears to be handy.
Since this kind of hand sanitizer is easy to use and can quickly make microorganisms lose activity, it is becoming more and more used; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless no soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-free hand washing can cause drying of skin, unless the formula has been added to the skin and/or hydration.
Can add glycerin and/or other skin to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying of skin caused by alcohol.
When compared to soap or antibacterial cleansing in a clinical experiment, the alcohol-free handwash with a gel reduces skin irritation and skin dryness.
It is rare to be allergic to dermatology, dermatology, anaphylaxis, or to add sensitization to alcohol or alcohol hand sanitizers.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, the possibility of alcohol-free handwashing liquid circulating irritating syphilis is low, which is an attractive reason.
Water-free cleaning is very effective, but it does not remove the organic material on your hand, but it is only disinfecting.
Therefore, hands-free hand sanitizers do not work as much as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, because these pathogens are in their hands.
The efficacy of non-alcoholic hands-free is largely dependent on the ingredients and formulas, and its effect is much worse than alcohol and alcohol hand sanitizers.
Recently, the use of blinked chlorine formula has been proven to have sustained, cumulative antibacterial activity after use, which is different from alcohol, alcohol has been proven to reduce the effect after reuse, may be due to gradually causing adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t make up soap, but they can use grassy or land instead.
Washing hands with grassy ash or grassy ash alone, but not as soap.
One of the problems that exist is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated with microorganisms, then it may accelerate the transmission of diseases rather than the dislocation.
As with soap, grassy ash is also a sanitizing pot, because it will form a heterogeneous solution after it encounters water.
WHO Recommendations If there is no soap available, you can use grassy ash or sand instead of soap.
The correct hand washing methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of disease are as follows:
Tease hands with flowing warm water or jet water.
The recommended water flow is because the tub may be contaminated, and the water temperature seems to be not very much related.
Use sufficient amount of soap to repeatedly wash to produce foam, while washing the back of the hand, fingers and nails.
Soap removes the bacteria on the skin, and studies show that when people wash their hands with soap instead of single water, they tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Wash for at least 20 seconds.
Washing can produce friction, which helps remove bacteria on the skin, the longer it washs, and the more germs it removes.
Fully cleaned with flowing water.
Washing your hands with water sinks can cause re-pollutation.
Dry or dry naturally with clean towels.
The hand tidal ratio is easy to be re-polluted. The thumb, the area between the wrist, fingers, and the nail splatter are the most commonly overlooked parts.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may hide microorganisms.
It is usually recommended to use moisturizing lotion to avoid hand drying; skin drying can lead to skin flushing, which increases the risk of infection transmission.
Where water and/or soap cannot be obtained in developing countries, a variety of low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate hand washing, for example, through a dull barrels or holes of buried water, and/or using grassy hand washing (where necessary). In the case of water supply limited (e.g., schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving hand washing programs can be used, for example, simple and easy water spills and other low-cost ways.
Simple water stylus technology is very simple, with the brush to make a good styli, and then by a pedal to the hand a small amount of water, then use soap.
Effective hand scrubbing is an important step in the hand health process, but there are some debates about the most effective way of hand drying in public health.
More and more studies have shown that scarves are more healthy than electric handsets available in many bathrooms.
In 2008, London University of Westminster conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium in the scarf industry, comparing to scarf, warm dry phone and more modern radiant dry phone, in terms of hygiene.
After washing your hands, use a warm dry cell phone to dry hands, and find that the total number of bacteria on your fingers increased by 1947 and the total number of palm bacteria increased by 254% on average.
In addition, the total number of germs on the fingers increases by 42% on average, and the average number of handheld germs increases by 15% on average.
Wash hands after scrubbing hands, the total number of bacteria on your fingers reduces by 76% on average, and the total amount of palm bacteria decreases by 77% on average. Scientists have also conducted tests to determine whether various dryers may cause cross-infection between other toilet users and toilet facilities.
It is said that the jet-type phone is airtight in 180 meters/sec (650 km/h; 400 miles/h), able to blow the hand and the microorganisms on the machine, which may pollute other toilet users and toilet facilities within 2 meters.
Use a heated dry phone to transmit microorganisms to 0.25 meters outside of the dry phone.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate different ways of doing things.
The number of germs that have been observed after the dryer has seen the following changes:
There are many different cell phone manufacturers involved in the study, comparing these cell phones with scarves.
During the trip, you can choose to use hand sanitize towels to wash your hands without soap and water.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizer should reach at least 60%.
In 1846, Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered that hand washing could effectively prevent the spread of diseases in the hospital. However, after a long period of time, it was only necessary to force the medical staff to wash their hands.
Hospitals use electronic devices that provide feedback to alert hospital workers when they forget to wash their hands.
A study found that the rate of infection after the use of these devices decreased.
Wash your hands for at least 15 seconds, and use sufficient amounts of soap and water or condensation when washing your hands to generate a bubble and carry the parts of your hands.
Double-handed fingers with each other.
If there is a scratch between the nails, it can be removed with a hard brush.
Since the water left in the hand may still have germs, it is important to completely clean and dry with a clean towel.
After the scrubbing, the scarf should be used to shut down the water scarf (use scarf to open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hand from being contaminated again due to touching these surfaces.
In a medical health institution, the purpose of washing hands is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and avoid transmission.
"The New England Journal of Medicine" report shows that in most medical environments, there is still a case where hand washing does not reach an acceptable level, a large number of medical staff often forget to wash their hands before accepting patients, leading to the spread of microorganisms.
A study showed that proper hand washing coupled with other simple procedures can reduce the blood flow infection rate related to the catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization published a worksheet, the standard method of hand washing and hand washing of the medical organ was demonstrated.
The organization has also published draft manual hygiene guidelines on its website for public advice.
Whitby et al. has written about it.
If you need to verify the compliance of the law, then commercial equipment can be counterparty health measures and verification.
The World Health Organization recommends “five moments” to wash hands:
After receiving the blood / body fluid
Before sterile operation and
After taking care of the patient. Adding antimicrobial chemicals to the soap ("chronized soap" or "antibacterial soap") allows the hand wash to produce a germ effect.
In an environment before surgery or with a large number of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, it may be necessary to operate this type of germ. In order to do the procedure and 'waste' hand, there must be no need for a touch to open and shut off the water tray, chlorine-containing or iodine hand sanitizer, wash hands later to scrub the hands of the germless towels, wipes the sterile brush and cleans the nail sterile tools.
All heads are removed.
This procedure requires washing hands, forearms up to the elbow, usually washing for 2–6 minutes.
No need to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, it is necessary to prevent water from coming back on the front arm.
After the hand has been washed, use the sterile cloth to dry and wear the handwork.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hands-free, germs before and after a patient has been touched.
In order to control Staphylococcus infections in hospitals, people find that the maximum benefit of hand cleansing comes from the fact that hand wash frequency has reached 20%, when the frequency of hand cleansing has increased to more than 35%, the further benefit is limited.
When compared to using an antibacterial soap, washing your hands with regular soap causes more than three times more bacterial infectious diseases to be transmitted to food. After comparing hand washing with an antibacterial soap with an alcohol hand sanitizer (30 seconds respectively), it is found that the proportion of bacterial infections with an alcohol hand soap is 26% lower than an antibacterial soap.
However, for the reduction of H1N1 influenza A (HI1N1 influenza A) virus in hand and the identification of Clostridium difficile spores, soap and water are more effective than alcohol hand sanitizers.
For all kinds of medical conditions, which interventions are most effective and need further research.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered as a cost-effective tool to achieve physical health, and even good nutrition.
However, people’s homes, schools, and workplaces lack reliable water supply, soap, or hand washing facilities, which makes popular hand washing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most African rural areas, even if there is a cheap way to build a hand resting table, it is very rare to have a hand washing water shed in the vicinity of each private hygienism or public hygienism.
However, the low frequency of hand washing may also be ingrained erroneous, rather than because of the lack of soap or water.
Promote and advocate the use of soap hand washing can affect policy development, improve awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavioral changes in residents.
If you want to be effective, you must be supervised and assessed.
Through systematic assessment of 70 studies, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) increased the proportion of hand washing, based on community-based methods are effective, and social campaign effects are poor. One example of the school to advocate hand washing is the implementation of the United Nations Children's Foundation's "Samsung Method", in addition to other health requirements, encourage schools to take simple, cheap measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum is reached, the school can rise from one star to the highest three stars.
Hand washing promotion activities can include the construction of hand washing stations to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of raising awareness of hand washing is the World Washing Day, which aims to try to make a difference in behavior. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund has promoted the use of a sign of hand washing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries and the relationship between avoiding the adjustment of DALY.
However, there are reports that compared with other water and sanitation interventions, the cost of promoting hand washing with soap is more difficult.
The earliest recognition of the importance of hand washing to human health - especially for those who are physically weak (e.g. mothers or soldier after the birth of the hospital) is a leading figure in the 19th-century hand hygiene field: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, working in Austria Vienna, and British "the founder of modern care" Florence Nightingale.
At that time, most people still believe that the infection was caused by the deodorization of what is called bruising.
The outbreak of food-borne diseases in the 1980s and medical infections, prompting the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to advocate hand health, strong hand health is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of smolar influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap in order to protect people from such infectious diseases.
For example, Germany will find a "correct method of hand washing" poster next to the bathrooms in public toilets, office towers, and the restrooms in the airport.
The word "handwashing is not good" means that someone argues that it is not responsible for something or does not participate in something.
It originated from the content of the Bible in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to kill Jesus, and later became widely spoken in some groups of English speakers.
In Shakespeare's McWhite, Mrs. McWhite began to compulsively wash her hands on the stains trying to clean up her imagination, indicating she felt guilty of her crimes and mourning her husband's crimes.
Studies have shown that those who think or think of unethical behavior tend to wash their hands more often than others and often cherish their hand washing facilities more often.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after thinking of unethical behavior, it is unlikely to engage in other 'the effect of purging' actions, for example, to do volunteers.
Religion requires hand washing for health and symbolic purposes. Washing hand washing with water without soap is part of many religiously marked hand washings, including Baha'i faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim stool, Christian hand washing stains, and miscarriage in Islam.
Hinduism, Jewish and Islamic requirements to wash hands after hand.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.
COVID-19 Workplace Control
COVID-19 workplace prevention and control refers to the use of occupational safety and health measures to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Risk prevention and control at the workplace depends on the specific work site and work tasks and should be based on risk assessments of exposure sources, the severity of community disease and the risk factors of individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the low exposure risk of work with the public and other colleagues have the least contacts, so it is recommended to take basic infection prevention measures, including hand-washing, encourage employees to isolate from home after illness, follow respiratory arrest and daily cleaning and disinfection of work environment.
Medium exposure to risk includes work that requires frequent or close access to unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may be infected with ongoing community transmission or international travel.
Including regular public staff, such as schools, high crowd density working environment and some large-scale retail environment.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the group should also use high-efficiency air filters and protective devices for ventilation, wearing personal protective equipment and taking other risk control measures when approaching COVID-19 patients.
OSHA believes there is a high risk of exposure to healthcare workers and home workers who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, and the risk of exposure is high if a staff member performs a gas-soluble operation for a known or suspected COVID-19 patient, or collects or processes specimens from it.
Hazard prevention and control measures for this type of person include engineering control, such as controlled chambers and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have a significant impact on the workplace.
Staff may be absent due to illness, need to take care of others, or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changes in demand for goods, or changes in the way they are made (such as shopping during off-peak hours, or using a delivery or drop off service).
Finally, product logistics from COVID-19’s most severe areas may continue. Infection prevention and response plans can be used to guide protective actions.
These programs address the risk levels associated with various workplaces and job tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors from home and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers, such as older adults or groups with chronic diseases.
These plans also provide an overview of the prevention and control measures needed to address these risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise due to outbreaks of the pandemic.
Infection prevention and response programs may be subject to national or local recommendations.
The targets of the outbreak include reducing the spread of staff, protecting the risk of adverse health and complications, maintaining business operations, and minimising the adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the corresponding measures will also be affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the enterprise is located.
Hazard prevention and control level is a widely used prevention and control framework for occupational safety and health, and is used in accordance with the effectiveness of the risk prevention and control measures grouped.
If you can't eliminate the dangers of COVID-19 in the end, the most effective control measures for engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control is to isolate employees from the work-related dangers, rather than relying on the behavior of employees for control, which is also the implementation of the lowest cost solution.
Administrative control refers to the change of work policies or procedures, requiring employees or employers to take action on their own.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is less protective than engineering control and administrative control, but helps prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE need to be selected according to the level of danger faced by the staff, according to the appropriate situation (such as a ventilator), and must always be properly worn, regularly inspect and maintain, and when necessary, be replaced and properly disposed of, clean, stored or treated to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risks work with minimal involvement in careers with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all workplaces take basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, recommended that sick employees stay isolated, coughing or rushing to comply with respiratory radiance, provide scarf and trash, make remote office preparation, necessary to peak work, prevent employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintain the daily cleaning and disinfection of workplaces.
Identifying and segregation of infected individuals in a timely manner is the key to protecting workplaces, guests, guests and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that employees with acute respiratory symptoms appear to be at home isolated for at least 24 hours, until it is determined that there is no fever, fever and other symptoms, sick leave policy should be vigorous, allowing employees to take care of their sick households at home, and should clearly inform employees of the policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure involves frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within a 6-foot (1.8-meter) range, but may result in an individual being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 due to an ongoing community near the workplace or a recent COVID-19 outbreak.
This type of staff includes staff members who are employed in schools, high-density work environments, and in some large-volume retail environments will be greeted by general public. Engineering control measures for these groups and high-risk groups include installing efficient air filters, improving ventilation effects, transparent plastic protective equipment and other physical barriers, as well as installing a free-of-home window to provide customer service. Administrative control of this group and high-risk groups includes encouraging the isolation of sick workers at home, using virtual communications instead of face-to-face meetings, establishing a peak shift system to cancel unnecessary travel to the COVID-19 outbreak site, setting up emergency communication plans, including responding to the staff's questions of the forum, providing staff with the latest education and training on COVID-19 factors and protective practices, and providing personnel with at least necessary for the use of protective and protective equipment, and other protective measures, including training to provide personnel to improve the use of personal protective and protective equipment and protective equipment.
This type of staff preferably requires a respirator.
If someone is sick on an aircraft, proper protective measures should be taken to protect the staff and other passengers, including arranging the patient to a distance of 6 feet from other passengers, specifying an organization to serve the patient, providing the patient with a mask, or requiring the patient to use a scarf to scarve and rinse at a time of cough.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for someone who is sick, touching the body fluid, or having a contaminated surface. If the sick person finds symptoms such as fever, coughing, or difficulty in breathing, the crew should also wear extra personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other disposable items should be treated in a biohazard bag, after which the contaminated surface should be cleaned and sterilized. For commercial transport, including navigation and other passenger ships, dangerous prevention and control measures may also include a rolling travel when the disease is ill.
Ideally, medical conditions should be carried out in the quarantined people. For schools and childcare places, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if infected people have appeared in the school, regardless of the community fragmented situation, are to close the corresponding schools and childcare places for a short period of time, clean or disinfect.
Social distance strategy can be implemented for low-to-moderate community transmission, such as site visits, rallies and sports courses, chorus classes or cafeteria meals and other large-scale gathering situations, increase the distance between the desks, peak to-site and off-site, limit non-essential visitors to the public, and arrange a health office for children with flu symptoms.
If the community spreads seriously, in addition to the implementation of social distance strategy, it is also possible to consider extending the duration of the course. For law enforcement officers performing routine activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sees that the direct health risks for their face are low.
It is recommended to have COVID-19 access to identify patients or potential individuals who are required to follow the same level of protection as first aid medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
If a close relationship occurs during the arrest process, the staff should first clean and disinfect their working belts and equipment, then use home cleansing or wipe cleaning, and should comply with the standard personal protective equipment sealing and disposal procedures and clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.
OSHA considers certain health care and home workers to be highly or very high in exposure.
High-risk personnel include health care, support, labs, and health care workers who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 infections.
Staff are highly exposed if they have known or suspected to have COVID-19 patients running droplets generation procedures, or if they collect or process specimens of an infected person or suspected infected person.
Bubble generation programs include plug, cough-guided procedures, bronchial survey, some dental procedures and inspections, or body specimen collection.
Staff at the high exposure zone included staff involved in organizing the deceased corpus, who were identified or suspected to have COVID-19 before their lives; if anatomical is performed, the exposure risk is higher. The work measures taken on this risk group are also included in the isolation room for confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, including at the time of the conduct of the droplet generation process.
Some medical facilities and abort rooms can also be equipped with a specialized tubing system.
Biosafety Level 3 precautionary measures should be taken at the time of processing the specimen.
The World Health Organization (WTO) recommends different waiting zones for patients based on whether the patient is a suspected COVID-19 case. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration also recommends that people working within a 6-foot range known or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as those conducting the droplet generation procedure, wear ventilators.
The United States requires the use of N95 oversold masks or better masks approved by NIOSH in a comprehensive text breathing protection program environment such as health screening, training, medical screening, etc.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve the comfort of the staff. The WHO does not recommend the use of protective equipment, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and does not spread through the body fluid.
WHO recommended entry point checkers only need to wear a medical surgical mask.
For staff who need to collect respiratory specimens from people with COVID-19 and provide care or transfer services to patients without the need for a droplet-in process, WHO recommends that they use medical surgical masks, nurseries or masks, robbers and gloves.
If you want to run the droplet generation process, you must replace a medical surgical mask with a N95 or FFP2 mask.
Insufficient supply of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends the supply of the same ventilator, monitoring and monitoring of personal protective equipment through remote medical treatment, transparent windows and other physical barriers, only to allow direct caregivers to enter the rooms of COVID-19 patients, only the specific task is necessary to use personal protective equipment when used, in the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis results continue to use the same ventilator, monitoring and monitoring of personal protective equipment and does not encourage the use of masks and other measures to reduce the need for personal protective equipment.

Since this month, we have encountered some daunting situations.
In front of the COVID-19 pandemic, we clearly felt the rest and commonality of all human lives, and at the same time recognized our responsibility to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we know that the best measures to address this challenge requires people around the world to feel, work together and promote community building, which is at the heart of Wikimedia.
The love and care of all colleagues among us through email, phone and chat, which fully demonstrates the difference between our colleagues, who are fortunate to work with you.
I am grateful and proud to be a colleague with you.
Last week, someone was interested in our work.
They made me realize that Wikipedia is available throughout the world at this time, and that's one thing that makes me feel like it's all about, and at the same time let me know that this resource is maintained to function properly and gives the world the symbolic power.
Whether your work is website operation, payroll payment or community security, the normal operation of Wikimedia is not inseparable from your hard work.
The current world needs information from Wikipedia more than ever.
At the present stage, the content of our work and the way we work will all have an important impact on the world.
The significance of this mission and the responsibility of your colleagues to the shoulder, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work next week.
Adjustment of working style and timetable
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss how the company works and schedules in the next few days to the next few months.
At the meeting, we considered what we considered the appropriate measures for the company’s current challenges, as well as best practices to ensure that the company remains sustainable during the pandemic.
The executive team agreed to reduce pressure for the company's employees, so that we can support the company's mission for a long time.
We support you with the right amount of work pressure.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week), after which change will be announced.
This adjustment is not a holiday notification. If you can work longer a day, we will arrange the task for you based on your working hours.
However, it is unpredictable in the current world shape, and we will prioritize your personal needs, such as caring for your family, shopping out, or seeing a doctor’s opinion.
We do not track your working hours.
If you are sick, let go of work.
It's self-evident, but we want to remind you, please rest assured.
You don’t need to have a sick or paid time off, but you’ll need to inform the manager and help your team modify their work schedule to ensure that the work areas of your focus are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please let Bryan, the Department of Talent and Cultural Operations, who will support you and ensure that your situation is well received by the Management.)
For hourly employees, we pay the full amount of the salary.
We have said it and have again committed to our commitment to contractors and our hourly staff.
The salary paid by us to everyone will continue to be calculated based on the remuneration they receive during their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
Even if you are sick or are unable to work.
If you are willing to work, we will support you.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through work and release their own pressure.
Our work can bring incredible returns, even more in the current period.
But taking care of yourself is still the first one.
We ask you to keep in touch with your manager so that we can keep up to date and make adjustments accordingly.
Prioritize your important work.
We must maintain the normal operation of some important work.
Web Reliability Engineering Teams, Human Resource Operations Teams, Trust & Security Teams, and Fundraising Teams (and others) work critically, which may require additional support.
We will begin to evaluate the current items with all departments and shift the focus to supporting some of the things that are critical to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus our work on the most important projects.
Slowing down in time will not affect future development.
We are not going to "overtime progress" after the epidemic.
We will not ask you for overtime follow-up because it is not practical to see now.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new goals and schedules as appropriate.
What changes will the APP (Annual Plan) be made?
In order to meet the new real-time and daily working hours requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for the 2020-2021 plan.
We would like to mention the extension of the 2019-2020 plan, taking more time to make a budget, so that all employees can prioritize and care for themselves and their families; at the same time, adjust work arrangements for employees who need or want to reduce their workload in the weeks to come.
The extended schedule can reduce the current planned workload of the entire organization and reduce the workload.
We will make the above proposals to the Board next week. If the mention is passed, we will soon update the work arrangements to you and the team after the update.
Thanks to the leadership of the APP team in this process.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a San Francisco office colleague may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, due to prudence, we hire some anti-virus cleaners to completely disinfect the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade disinfection solutions to disinfect various surfaces as well as buildings and elevators leading to our building.
The firm is performing its attention to the task contract, using the corresponding products to ensure the safety of tenants.
We believe that when we decide to go back to work, the office is well prepared to welcome everyone.
Our Washington D.C. offices use WeWork offices, WeWork, and we share the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington D.C. staff.
As of last week, the Washington D.C. offices have been transferred to a full-time remote office in accordance with the guidelines we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some of the New York office colleagues already know, we have also been talking about the issues related to renting office locations in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be rolled out.
Some colleagues visited the remote office for the first time.
Some other long-term employees of the firm want to provide some advice on how to adjust their work style:
Meeting time should be controlled within one to two hours.
For a longer period, please consider distributing the meeting content to multiple dates.
Define meeting objectives, develop meeting agendas, and send reading materials in advance.
Use video conferencing as the default way of meeting, and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom for online collaboration and contact.
In each meeting, schedule a host to host a meeting, schedule one person to monitor the comments in the chat window and track the changes in the list of speakers, and arrange another person to (or use multi-modal method) to help make the meeting log.
If you need comfortable earphones, please contact the technical support department by email.
Use your health credentials to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations team is studying the form of a webinar on human body engineering guidance to help the Foundation all colleagues improve their work efficiency during distributed offices.
Last week, we asked all community beneficiaries to cancel public events such as Pine Funded by Wikimedia prior to the end of the WHO announcement.
These requests for cancellations and other restrictions may result in these community grantees not being able to complete the original donation campaign, and we have informed them that we understand it, while at the same time being acknowledged that no one of them will be imprisoned as a suggestion or modification of these goals.
In the following week, we will continue to provide more guidance on community meetings and thematic sessions in Wikimedia and elsewhere.
The global community seems to be shrouded in the grief of the outbreak, but it also reflects the comfort of being able to clearly focus on their respective communities, Wikimedia, and other aspects.
In the future, the CRT team will create a page on Meta-Wiki, providing the community with a space to monitor the impact and keep track of community interactions with us.
Stay in touch with questions related to COVID-19
We plan to hold a Special Staff Meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 UTC, and we will send you an invitation to your calendar later.
At the meeting, we’ll share some updates, answer your questions, and leave some time for everyone to talk to and discuss.
We are here to help.
At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT team updates these pages in a timely manner and brings all the information in one place.
We are working to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries that are currently heavily affected by the pandemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, major workflows, or insurance, or need additional help, please feel free to contact the CRT team and work with them.
We are here to provide you with the support and contact you need.
If you have sensitive or confidential questions, please email Bryan Judan, Global Head of Human Resources Operations.
Maybe we face these changes, but we can't let go of our own work and the tasks.
Instead, the pandemic has helped us recognize that we may currently need to make adjustments to our work and duties in a way that has never been before.
We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to support each other’s ongoing work, provide the support we need for our actions, and continue to bring the services they depend on to the world.
Make a plan when you’re ready to go without any challenges.
Now, please support each other, together to create a space for the important work of the next weeks and even months.
We need everyone to contribute their power to achieve this goal, so please take care of yourself and your family so that you can stay at your best when you need it.
In the end, please be careful to wash your hands and do not touch.
Other members of the Katherine, CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) have been on top of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of the cells in the lungs, kinesiology, heart, anatomy, and tracts.
ACE2 is expected to be a drug target for cardiovascular disease by reducing the content of vascular mercury II and increasing the content of Ang(1-7) to inhibit the activity of associated vascular mercury-converting Enzyme (ACE). ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronaviruses to enter cells.
The human-source version of this enzyme is usually called hACE2.
Vascular mercury conversion enzyme 2 is a type of polysaccharide that is located on the surface of endemic cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-end Peptide M2 structure domain and a C-endend-end-end-collectrin amino acid transfer protein structure domain.
ACE2 is a monotonous I-type membrane protein whose enzyme active domain is exposed to the cellular surface of the lungs and other tissues.
Another enzyme known as the sheddase cracks the domain of the outer cell of ACE2 from the cross-membrane structure, resulting in soluble proteins that lie into the bloodstream and are finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes, mainly lung type II pulmonary foam cells, limbs on the limbs, most organs of the dysplasia and cytokine cells, as well as inflammatory smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA manifestations were also found in large skins, sprinklers, down dungeons, and brain dryers.
The main functions of ACE2 are to balance ACE.
ACE divides vascular mercury I into vascular mercury II with vascular rejuvenation.
ACE2 Arc-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe (H-Asp-Arg-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) is an end-of-line amino acid phenylalanine whose water is lyseptic, which has the activity of vascular arculin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also crack many other peptides, including arginine 9 hydroseptide, apelin, neurodegenerative hormones, morphine A and gastractive hormones.
ACE2 can also regulate the membrane transporting of the neutral amino acid tolerant protein SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronaviruses to enter cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV2 combined with the enzymes of ACE2 on the surface of the cell, resulting in the culmination of viruses and enzymes moving together into the nuclei of the cell.
This entry process also requires host sulfate protease TMPRSS2, which is causing the activation of S-protein, and is currently studying whether the process inhibits it as a potential cure. Some people have speculated that lowering the ACE2 level in cells may help fight infections.
However, a number of professional associations and regulatory bodies have advised on the use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB treatments.
A system evaluation and drug analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “use of ACE inhibits the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group.”
And, “For patients with high pneumonia risk, especially patients with intermediate and heart failure, the use of ACE inhibitive treatment will also reduce pneumonia risk.
The use of ACE is also associated with the reduction of pneumonia-related mortality, but the results are not as reliable as reducing overall pneumonia."
ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new way to treat acute lung syndrome, which seems to improve the pulmonary fluid dynamics index and blood oxygen level in the syringe of lipolys caused by lipid polysaccharides.
rhACE2 The half-life of rhACE2 in the human body is about 10 hours, and it lasts for 30 minutes, and the process of action (duration) is 24 hours.
Some studies have shown that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients who are not tolerated by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in suppressing the elevated levels of rhACE II. The efficacy of rhACE2 has been evaluated for clinical trials.
The b'COVID-19 app is a mobile software designed to cope with the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, helping to track close contacts, identify individuals who may have been exposed to the infection ("recipients").
Some districts and pipelines have developed or come up with a lot of apps with the support of the official government.
A lot of frameworks for building close reader tracking applications have been established.
Privacy issues have also attracted multiple attention, especially some systems need to track the geographic location of app users.
An invasive alternative includes using a Bluetooth signal to record the distance between the user and another phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Fox Alliance announced that they would integrate the features of this Bluetooth-enabled app directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government has jointly developed an app with Alipay to support citizens to self-check if they have been admitted to COVID-19 patients.
The program is currently used in over 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an app called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community, published as an open source software, and transferred to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based application "StopKorona!", which is used to track the potential exposure of infected persons, to help the medical institution make a quick response.
The app was developed by the North Macedonian Ministry of Communication and Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is waiting for approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the Closer Tracker app has entered the development stage and will be put into use in the coming weeks. Ireland and France also plan to launch similar apps (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering Singapore based TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol development similar app. Russia is planning to launch a geo-glove app for patients living in Moscow with COVID-19 confirmed germs to ensure that they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at Cambridge University, led some practical issues that could exist in the application system, including false reports, as well as the lack of effectiveness if only a small percentage of people use the application.
In order to ensure the spread of the guided or harmful "Coronavirus" app, the crocodile sets limits on the type of organization that can publish the crown virus related app in the crocodile app store, that is, only limited to "official" or other sound groups.
Google and Amazon have also implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy activists say they are using the coronavirus app for a large-scale surveillance programme, especially if it should be dismantled as a monitoring infrastructure built to address the coronavirus pandemic after the COVID-19 pandemic has been removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations both cry out to limit this vision.
These organisations have announced eight requirements for government projects:
The watch must be "legal, necessary and proportional";
Monitor and monitor the expansion must have the "sunset" terms;
The data collected is limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected with evidence that they are protected;
Digital monitoring must avoid encompassing discrimination and declination;
Any data sharing with third parties shall be defined in accordance with the law;
It is necessary to provide safeguards to prevent the use of data and to provide citizens with the right to deal with the data;
Requires all 'related stakeholders' to participate', including requiring public health experts and a cultured group to participate. The Germany Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also published a checklist of checks.
The Google/Angle Program is designed to solve continuous monitoring problems, and once it is no longer necessary to track it, it will be removed from the device operating system.
Some countries use location tracking based on the web instead of the app, users do not need to download the app, while avoiding the situation of being tracked.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to raw location data may have serious privacy issues.
However, not all systems that come with a central server require access to personal location data; many private protection systems that use only the central server for mutual communication are now created (see below).
Korea has launched a non-application-based system to perform agent tracking tasks.
The system does not use dedicated applications, but choose to collect tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine this information to send notifications to potential infected people via SMS.
In addition to using the information to remind potential close visitors, the government has also been granted permission to disclose location information, as the country made major changes to the information privacy law after the MERS outbreak.
Public access to this information is available through many applications and websites. There are also some countries (including Germany) that use centralized systems and privacy protection while in their exams.
As of April 6, 2020, specific details have not been announced.
Privacy Protection Closer Tracking is a public concept with a large number of related research articles dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts have researched the distance between users and other phones using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) recording.
PEPP-PT is a protocol that contains a centralized and distributed method and is not a single protocol. Distribute protocols include Distributed Privacy Protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, original known as contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols, and mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT), and more.
According to these protocols, personally identifiable personal data does not leave the device, and all matches are performed on the device.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab’s privacy group has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection technology when collecting and using location or route cross data to track COVID-19.
The platform was developed based on the content of the March 2020 White Paper study titled “Invasive App: Maintaining Personal Privacy during the Pandemic”. In addition, Enigma MPC, a company originally founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab and is committed to developing privacy technology, has also developed a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace supports users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising privacy with secure hardware technology.
On April 5, 2020, some groups were formed to reduce fragmented information and support the global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key to achieving a wide range of applications.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that its official government app was using the Open Source BlueTrace protocol.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Foxconn, who control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a closely followed tracking program that would play a role in protecting privacy by combining Bluetooth low-power technology with privacy-protected encryption.
In addition, they have also published the core technical specifications used in the system.
The system is planned to be launched in three stages, according to the fruit and Google:
Launch of tools to support the government in creating an official privacy-protective coronavirus tracking app
This feature is integrated directly into iOS and Android systems, and Google and Fox plans to launch the system first through OS updates. After the pandemic, the system will also be deleted in the same way, in order to solve the problem of post-continuation monitoring.

Virus carrier (Gen I Developer and Candidate Vaccine: CanSino Biologics, Type 5 viral carrier)
CEPI scientists reported in April that there are a total of 115 vaccine candidates in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been identified as ongoing projects (based on the Milken Institute’s data of 79) and 37 have been announced, but there are little to no public information (presumption is being planned or designed).
Phase I-II trials are preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually given multiple clicks of random randomness, comfort control, and at the same time determine a more precise and effective amount of effort.
The Phase III trial usually involves more participants, which contains a control group, and tests the effectiveness of vaccines against disease, while monitoring for the optimal amount of adverse reactions.
In the 79 vaccine candidates under active development (confirmation as of early April 2020), there are 74 people who have not yet conducted a human evaluation (still in the “pre-clinical” study).

Some vaccines have a hydration effect, also known as non-specialty effects.
This means that in addition to preventing diseases, they can bring other benefits.
Further randomized trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health care professionals.
The vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
Using COVID-19 speciality animal models, such as ACE2 genetic mice, other experimental animals and non-human long-range animals, to assess the efficacy of the vaccine, early studies have shown that biosafety level 3 containment measures need to be taken for active viruses and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested in the non-human animal model.
As of 2020, there are no safe and effective SARS treatment or preventive vaccines for humans.
According to the research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, there is no effective vaccine for MERS.
When MERS is prevalent, people believe that existing SARS studies can provide useful templates for developing vaccines and treatments for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has been completed with a Phase I human clinical trial, and three other vaccines are being developed, all of which are viral carrier vaccines, two are adenovirus carrier vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and the MVA carrier vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Various social media articles have helped to suggest that the virus behind COVID-19 has already been found and that vaccines have already been available.
The patents cited in various social media articles refer to the patents of other strains of the existing coronavirus (such as SARS-CoV) strain genetic sequences and vaccines.
2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a type of infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and rush.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle soreness, diarrhea, grief, lost grief, and abdominal pain.
The opportunistic period from patients receiving treatment to the onset varies from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.
Although most cases are small, some cases develop viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, the total number of cases reported in 210 countries and territories worldwide exceeded 224 million cases, with more than 153,000 deaths.
There are currently more than 568,000 people who treat it. The virus is mainly transmitted between people and people by proximity, often spread through the dispersion of lathers generated by coughing, wrestling, or talking.
Despite the flue creates droplets, droplets usually fall on the ground or on the surface of various objects and do not cause distance infections.
In addition, if someone touches the surface of the virus, and then touches their own mouths, they may also be infected with the virus.
Viruses can survive for up to 72 hours on the surface of the object.
Although the pre- and post-resumption of the disease may also be transmitted, three days before the disease is the most contagious. The standard diagnostic method is to test the rRT-PCR in real-time inverse transcription polymerase response (rRT-PCR).
Masks are recommended for people who are suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers.
The advice of public masking varies from place to place. Some authorities oppose masking, and others require masking.
There are currently no COVID-19 vaccines or special effects antiviral treatment options available.
Most of the six WHO regions have reported local transmissions of the disease.
People who are infected with the virus may develop asymptomatic symptoms, and may have suspected symptoms of influenza such as fever, cough, weakness, and empathy.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, heartache or chest arrest, blurry consciousness, soaring to awake and tone to the mouth or lips; if these symptoms are present, it is recommended to have immediate medical attention.
A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, sneezing, or sore throat.
In addition, it detects different percentages of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as lazyness, chewing and diarrhea.
Some cases in China initially only show signs of chest and heart disease.
Some cases may develop viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even lead to death.
We refer to this as the period of incubation.
The opposing period for COVID-19 is typically 5-6 days, but it may extend up to 2-14 days.
97.5% of people who are infected will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The report states that not all people who are infected will develop symptoms.
The role of an asymptomatic infection in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully clear; however, preliminary evidence suggests that an asymptomatic infection may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people who are diagnosed with asymptomatic infections has not been identified at this time and are still being studied at the end of the year. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that no symptoms have been shown in the course of hospitalization by 20% of cases.
On April 1, the National Health Council of China has included cases of asymptomatic disease as a daily report; 130 (78%) of the 166 infected people on the day were asymptomatic.
Septide and saliva can carry a large number of viruses.
Big Phosphores are more foam than normal sharks.
A study in Singapore found that no clunky cough could lead to the most distant release of droplets, 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this type of virus will not normally be transmitted through air, the National Academy of Sciences has determined that it may be transmitted through biogas dissolved, and that the air collector on the exterior corridor detects the viral RNA sofa.
Medical procedures such as ducts and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory discharges, resulting in airborne transmission.
People still feel confident that the virus may be transmitted through greedy, but this risk is considered to be low. When patients develop symptoms, the virus is the most contagious; although the symptoms may be spread before they appear, but the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) says that the transmission power of the virus is not yet fully clear, but that generally 1 person will infect 2-3 people. The virus survives on the surface of the object for a few hours to a few days.
Specifically, COVID-19 is known to survive on cardboard for one day, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% of haelic products.
However, its survival time is also influenced by humidity and temperature.
If used properly, soap and cleansing can also play as a result of the virus. Soap products can degrade the fat protection of the virus so that it loses its activity while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as chlorine chlorine and chlorine determine the effect of glucose acid osteoporosis (a type of surgical sterilization). A study in Hong Kong in China shows that on average, saliva samples are collected two days after admission.
5/6 patients with the first sample of the virus load was the highest, and 1/6 patients detected the highest virus load the next day.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first from three pneumonia patients in a batch of acute respiratory diseases in martial arts.
All features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are available in nature-related coronaviruses.
The virus can be burned with household soap before it enters the human body, as it can break the protective vinyl of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most important organ affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cell through the Vascular Genome Transformation Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has the highest content in the lungs type II pulmonary cell.
The virus is combined with ACE2 through a special surface glycoprotein called a "stablish" (cystic particles).
12% of infected patients found acute myocardial disorders in patients treated at martial arts hospitals in China, with higher proportions of those diagnosed with severe illness.
Overall inflammatory reactions and immune system disorders caused by the disease stimuli process, cardiovascular symptoms are higher incidence, but acute myocardial disorders may also be associated with the ACE2 receptor of the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and participate in the restorative heart function.
ICU-protected people with COVID-19 thrombosis (31%) and hives embolism (25%) are reportedly high and may be associated with poor prognosis. COVID-19 dead patients arguably discover diffuse pulmonary bubbles (DADs) and lymphocyte inflammatory in the lungs.
Despite SARS-COV-2, patients with severe illness experience over-inflammatory reactions to respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretion of T-cells in patients with COVID-19 is associated with the raising of inflammatory IL-6 secretive mononuclear cells and severe pulmonary pathology.
Tribulation reports abusing lymphatic cells.
WHO has announced several disease detection programs.
The standard detection method is using real-time reverse transcription polymerase response (rRT-PCR).
This test is typically tested for respiratory samples obtained through a nasal swab; however, it is also possible to use either a nasal swab or a sequential sample.
In general, results can be obtained from a few hours to two days.
Blood test can also be carried out, but two collection of blood need intervals for two weeks, the results do not have real-time value.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the corona strain and publish a sequence of genes so that laboratories around the world can independently develop PCR tests to detect if they are infected with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (not only detects activity-based infections, but also detects if an individual has been infected by a virus in the past) is still under development, but has not been promoted.
According to the experience of China, the accuracy of the test is only 60% to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. FDA approved the first instant diagnostic test and was put into operation at the end of the month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Central and South Medical School of Wuhan University proposed ways to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological symptoms.
Early infection with polysaccharide pulmonary polygrind glass shadow, with peripheral non-contrast and rear parts.
With the development of the virus, it is possible to develop under the brass, crushed road traces (small clans with different levels of pulmonary foam enrichment) and pulmonary changes.
There is little information about COVID-19 micropathology and pathology.
The main pathologies of curium have been found as follows:
naked eye check: pleuropitis, heart-packed inflammation, pulmonary swings and pulmonary movements
Four important levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Posture pneumonia: pulmonary limb, pulmonary cell proliferation, a large number of atypical lung cells, cytopene with lymphocyte infiltration and multi-nuclear macro cells formation
Severe pneumonia: DAD coherent pulmonary pulmonary foaming fluid.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxiaemia.
Pneumonia Recovery: pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pumpinization and pulmonary pulmonary stamina
Blood: transmissive vascular coagulation (DIC), lactose-peptine cell reaction
To reduce the prevalence of infection, preventive measures that can be taken include: staying at home; avoiding crowd-intensive areas; washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory health; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering your mouth with a scarf when coughing or scarring; if there is no scarf, it is recommended to cover it with your elbow.
It is recommended to clean your hand health after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends wearing cloth masks in public places to some extent prevent the transmission of virus by patients with an asymptomatic condition. Keeping the core of social distance strategy is closing school and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings, thereby reducing the opportunity for infected people to engage with large groups.
In addition, the social distance is set to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in human relationships.
There is no effective prevention of COVID-19 drugs. As it is expected to be at least until 2021, in order to develop vaccines, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are the key to control the spread of COVID-19, which is what we know is the “raping epidemiological curve.”
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after braces or when they have stains in their hands, before they stain, and after they stain, cough, or scare.
In addition, it is recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitizers of at least 60%, but only when there is no soap and tap water in the body. For areas where water-free hand sanitizer cannot be purchased, the WHO provides two formulas for in-place production.
These formulas stimulate antimicrobial activity through ethanol or glycol.
The use of helium peroxide to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; helium peroxide is not "hand disinfection of active substances".
Added glycerin as a reserve.
Support for sexual care, which may include saliva therapy, oxygen support and other vital organ support affected.
CDC recommends wearing a simple face mask for people who are suspected of carrying the virus.
Immediate use of ECMO to relieve respiratory failure, but its benefits are still to be studied.
It is recommended to maintain personal hygiene and advocate healthy lifestyles and diet habits, thereby improving immunity.
The WHO and the National Health Council of China issued an initiative to call for proper care for people with COVID-19 treated in the hospital.
American Critical Illness Experts and Lung Specialists have compiled the recommendations of various institutions and provided them free of charge through the IBCC.
COVID-19 treatment has not been developed as of April 2020.
For certain symptoms, some medical experts recommend a first-line treatment with chlorophosphorus (to acetylaminophenols) instead of ibuprofen.
It is necessary to take precautions to minimize the spread of the virus, in a medical environment to complete the possible production of gas-soluble operations, such as plugs or hand ventilation, especially should be aware of the protection.
In addition to standard preventive measures, access prevention measures, and air spread prevention measures, the CDC recommends that patients move to the airborne transmission isolation room (AIIR) for COVID-19 patients. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If possible, it is best to use a respirator instead of a mask.
N95 Face masks are approved for use in the industrial sector, but the FDA has authorized the use of such face masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is mainly used to prevent the inhalation of pneumatic particles (such as as gray curvature), but does not guarantee effective separating of specific biologics when used for other purposes.
If there are no masks, CDC recommends using face masks, and you can wear a custom mask if necessary.
Most COVID-19 cases are still small, and there is no need to use mechanical ventilation or other options, but a certain percentage of cases need to take such measures.
The healthcare provider is working on a clinical study to provide respiratory support for people with COVID-19 who are experiencing respiratory failure. Evidence suggests that the tubes with high flow oxygen or positive ventilators avoid the pipes.
It is not clear whether the above two treatment options can have the same effect on seriously ill patients.
If conditions are allowed, some medical doctors are oriented towards the use of innovative mechanical ventilation, because it is in the case of high-throughput oxygen oxygen, which can also limit the dispersion of air-soluble pellets. Serious cases are based on older adults (60 years or older, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries have insufficient per capita hospital beds, which are subject to medical conditions restrictions, the medical system can not cope with the situation of the need for hospital admission due to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases.
A study in China found that 5% of patients were sent to intensive care facilities, 2.3% were mechanically ventilated, and 1.4% would die.
About 30% of people admitted to the hospital in China are finally admitted to the ICU.
With the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) triggered by COVID-19, mechanical ventilation levels are further improved, and oxygen density is increasing.
When you need to use a ventilator that supports pressure control mode and high PEEP to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing the amount of ventilator triggering the risk of lung damage and gas chest.
The old ventilator may not be able to achieve high PEEP.
Since January 2020, there have been several antiviral drugs that have entered the clinical trial stage.
Radesich seems to be one of the most promising medications available today.
Although new drugs have been developed by or after 2021, many of the drugs that have been tested have either been approved for other purposes, or have entered the advanced testing stage.
Patients with severe illness can try to use antiviral drugs.
WHO calls on a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential trials in effectiveness and safety of therapies. The FDA has granted recurrent blood thrombosis as an experimental cure for life-threatening patients.
The necessary clinical studies have not been carried out to prove that the treatment is safe and effective in treating the disease.
In February 2020, China released a mobile app for curbing the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number upon request.
This application can detect the potential infection risk by monitoring the data "close contact".
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
Once detected as a potential risk, the app will not only recommend self-isolation, it will also issue alerts to local health officials. Combined with mobile phone data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence, it is possible to track infected persons and their contacts in Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government approved security authorities to track mobile phone data of suspected coronavirus carriers.
The purpose of this measure is to force isolation, to protect groups that may have access to an infected citizen.
In March 2020, Telecommunications shares total cell location data with the Federal Government Organization Robert Koch to study and protect against virus spread.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect personnel who have anti-isolation requirements.
Giulio Gallera, a health care specialist in Italy, points out that mobile telecom operator data shows that "40% of citizens are still moving around".
The German government hosted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, President Kersti Kaljulaid calls for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus across the globe.
Isolation, travel restrictions, treatment of side effects or self-infection, all of which can be embarrassed.
BBC quote Rory O'Connor's view, "social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn are the perfect storms for the mental health and well-being of people."
This disease is moderate, and the symptoms rarely even do not show symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Cases of mild illness can generally be recovered within two weeks, while cases of severe illness or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women have a higher risk of developing COVID-19 seriously ill patients, but lack COVID-19 data support, according to data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS. COVID-19 may have an impact on some people’s lungs, which can lead to pneumonia.
COVID-19 is likely to rapidly develop into the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the most affected areas, leading to respiratory failure, bloody shock or multi-organ dysfunctional failure.
COVID-19 related complications include erythroemia, cerebral abnormalities, as well as heart, limbs, and liver damage.
6% of people admitted to the COVID-19 hospital experience frequent coagulation, especially the extension of the coagulation enzyme time, while 4% of patients in the group experience normal abstinence.
Around 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transfoliase).
According to the same report, the average time from onset to death is ten days, with an average hospitalization time of five days.
However, the average time for patients admitted to the ICU to die is seven days.
Early case studies have found that the average time from early symptoms to death is 14 days, with overall time ranging from 6 to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Council of China (NHC) found that male mortality was 2.8% and female mortality was 1.7%.
Anatomical pulmonary tissue biopsy shows that two lungs are exhibiting a radical pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary coherent mucus secretion.
Lung cells have been observed to detect viral cell mutations.
Lung imagery is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Council of China caused heart damage due to elevated levels of musculoskeletal protein or sudden cardiac arrest.
According to data released in March of the United States, 89% of inpatients have a history of pre-existing medical conditions. Medical resources supply and regional social economic conditions can also affect mortality rates.
Difficulty in regional differences and methods, the mortality rate estimates for disease vary.
Underestimating cases of Alzheimer’s may result in an overestimated mortality rate.
However, if case death is due to a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
People who are smokers, smokers who have developed into severe cases of COVID-19 are 1.4 times higher than those who suffer from severe illness, and require intensive care or about 2.4 times more mortality. People have expressed concerns about the long-term consequences of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority of China found that some people who are recovered decreased lung activity by 20% to 30%, and the lung scanning shows organ damage.
In addition, after the recovery, you may face a severe medical care follow-up syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is not yet determined whether the infection will make the recovery effective and long-term immunity.
According to other corona virus behavioral characteristics, Immunity may be identified, but the coronary virus detection is reported shortly after some COVID-19 cases have been remedied.
People think of these cases as persistent infections rather than re-infection.
This virus is considered a natural virus, originating from animals, through overflowing with infections.
The actual origins have not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, the infection range is almost all human transmission.
The first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in January 2020, according to the first case study published in the Lancer, was dated December 1, 2019.
The earliest incidence date reported by the WHO official publication is December 8, 2019.
A number of methods are used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary over time and are affected by demographic characteristics such as measuring, health system quality, treatment options, the first outbreak time and age, gender and overall health conditions.
At the end of 2019, the WHO designated ICD-10 Emergency Disease Code U07.1 to the laboratory for the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and U07.2 to the clinical or epidemiological diagnosis for COVID-19 but without the laboratory for the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 death. The death rate is equal to the total number of deaths in the given time range divided by the total number of confirmed cases.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.9 percent (153,822/2,240,191).
The mortality rates vary from region to region. Other measurement criteria also include the death rate of cases (CFR) and infection rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of the number of deaths in a disease that accounts for the number of diagnoses, which reflects the percentage of the number of deaths in a disease that accounts for the number of infections (including both the number of diagnoses and the number of undiagnosed.)
These statistics are not limited in time, and are tracked throughout the process of a specific population being solved from an infection to a case.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infected people.
Castiglione d'Adda is a small town with just 4600 people and 80 (1.7%) are dead.
At Gangelt, the pandemic spreads through a variety of fanatic festivals, and even waves and young people, but the mortality rate is relatively low, not all COVID-19 deaths are officially narrowed.
In addition, the German medical system is no longer overwhelmed.
About 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies as assessed by experienced blood donors.
Until now, it is confirmed that 69 people (0.004% of the population) have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate varies from gender to gender.
Studies in China and Italy show that men have higher mortality rates than women.
Men aged 50-60 have the highest risk of death, with only 90 years of age having a similar gender gap.
China has a male mortality rate of 2.8% and a female mortality rate of 1.7%.
The exact cause of this gender difference is not yet clear, but it may be caused by both vigorous and behavioral factors.
Based on gender-based immunological differences, women have low absorption rate, and men develop syndromes (such as high blood pressure), the age is lower than women, resulting in higher mortality rates for men than women.
In Europe, 57% of men were infected with COVID-19, and 72% of men were killed.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked gender-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that the effects of viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu, and SARS have different effects on men and women.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher, and the percentage of infections is higher.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that it would officially name this disease "COVID-19".
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of WHO made an understanding of this: CO stands for “冠銶”, VI stands for “viruses”, D stands for “diseases”, 19 represents the first outbreak time (December 31, 2019).
The reason for choosing this name is to avoid referencing a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or population to meet the recommendations of international naming against stigmatization. The virus that triggered COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, WHO is also using the "COVID-19 virus" and "Viral that causes COVID-19" in Daikoku broadcasts.
Diseases and viruses are called "Coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak of China's martial law, people commonly refer to viruses and diseases as "Coronavirus" and "Muan's coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary viruses and disease names based on 2015 guidelines on the use of location in disease and virus names.
On February 11, 2020, the full name of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was released.
Molybdenum is present in the standard supply chain capacity limit, some digital manufacturers start printing health care materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
As an example, an Italian hospital urgently needs ventilation, the supplier can not deliver parts within the required time, a local start-up company performs reverse engineering, overnight print out the required 100 ventilation valves.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, information about disease origins, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of paranoia, false information and false information interchangeably and rapidly spread through the internet.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
No evidence of virus copying has been found in mesticulous, silos and silos.
There are currently no drugs or vaccines approved for the treatment of this disease.
Government agencies, academics and industry researchers are working on international research to develop vaccines and drugs that treat COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the 'combo test', the assessment is currently most likely to produce effective four existing antiviral compounds treatment effect.
There is currently no vaccine, but organisations at all levels are working on the vaccine.
Thanks to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, both via ACE2 receptors into human cells, the previous work of SARS-CoV needs to be leveraged.
People are working on three vaccine strategies.
First of all, researchers plan to develop a full viral vaccine.
Using this virus, whether inactive or deadly viruses, the aim is to provoke the human body's rapid immune response when new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy is to develop a subunit vaccine that aims to develop a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to respond to certain subunits of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, this study focused on helping the virus invade the S spike protein of ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is to develop a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA vaccine or RNA vaccine, a novel vaccine research technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the aforementioned test vaccines must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched their first vaccine clinical trials.
The vaccine contains a sequence of non-harmful genes that have been copied from the virus that causes the disease. People have always believed that the role of antibody-intensifying may be a major challenge in developing the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but there is a case for this method.
There are more than 300 clinical trials carried out as of April 2020.
The seven tests were evaluated and approved for use in the treatment of ailments, including four studies on chlorine chlorine or chlorine rash.
Conversion of antiviral drugs accounts for the vast majority of Chinese research, and nine clinical trials will be conducted in several countries by the end of April on Radesich’s Phase III clinical trial.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs has been initiated. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently being evaluated, including remdesivir, chlorine and chlorine rash, Lopina/Litona and Lopina-Litona-Litona-Litona-Litone combined coherine β.
As of March 2020, the efficacy of the remdesivir has been preliminary verified.
Clinical studies have found that patients treated with symmetrical remdesivir have some relief from clinical symptoms.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the United States, China, and Italy. In February 2020, China launched chlorine rash (used in the past to treat mellitus) and achieved preliminary results.
However, there was a call to the peer review of this research implementation.
South Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorine rash.
However, the Institute of martialvirology recommends taking 1 g per day, while reminding you that the amount of doubles is very dangerous and may even be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for chlorine and chlorine, but the doctor has the right to decide whether to use the above two kinds of drugs to treat people with COVID-19. The seventh edition of the guidelines in China also proposed the use of coercination, liba relinal, or ric acid Abidolore to treat COVID-19.
Preliminary data shows that high-volume liba reforestation has a suppression effect on SARS-CoV-2 outside the body.
After empirical low vile inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, further in-human studies are recommended using oligonet. Studies have shown that the original stabbed protein triggered by transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a prerequisite for the entry into the human body for the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors.
Whether used in combination with or not, chlorine and chlorine studies have significant limitations, and the medical community cannot accept these treatments unless further research has been carried out. Oscram has no inhibition effect on SARS-CoV-2 outside the body, and has not yet been found to have therapeutic effects on COVID-19.
Cell factor storms can become complications of post-pandemic treatment for people with severe illness.
It has been shown that chlorine arteries may have antibody-factor storming properties. After completing a small study, the National Health Council of China has included cassette resistance as a therapeutic guide.
With the results of the test presented by patients with severe illness, Italy is conducting a National Phase 2 Non-Aligned Pilot Test.
Combined with serotonin blood test, the identification of cytokines, is designed to curb the development of the condition, and cytokines are considered to lead to the death of some infected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved the use of a white cytokine 6 receptor anti-septic septic treatment due to other causes of steroid refractory cytokine, ie. CAR T cell therapy, with the support of the reseptic case study.
To date, there has been no inadvertent matching evidence that a styli can effectively cure the CRS.
Currently, we are working on the extraction of celebral sovereign antibodies produced by the COVID-19 reseptic immune system, injecting those who need the antibodies as passive immunosuppressive method before the vaccine’s development is successful.
The strategy has been tried during the SARS pandemic, but it has not been effective yet.
Viral and passive antibody immunosuppressive mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 immune system.
However, some other mechanisms, such as antibody based on cytotoxicity and/or swallowing, can also achieve the same effects.
Other forms of passive antibodies are currently being developed, such as the use of artificial monocloning antibodies.
The production of recurrent serum may increase and facilitate rapid deployment. The serum is made up of the fluid part of the blood of the recurrent patient, which contains the special antibody against this virus.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wen-kwong, a doctor at Wuhui City Center, raises awareness of the spread of the coronavirus, and is unfortunately infected with COVID-19 and died.
