"The focus remains rebalancing, shifting center of gravity or no matter how you want to describe it. 」
But he admits that the United States is closely related to Europe.
He said: “We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do.”
“The Russians may face the population and economic challenges, but history proves that they will be very hard if we conflict with them.”
As part of the United States’ reestablishment against the east of Russia, China and other rivals, the U.S. Navy is actively deploying forces into a “new war mode”, which will help counter opponents against the U.S. fleet of jets or other assets at any given time and location, which will be underwhelmed.
He said: “ We are tsunamis and tsunami gangsters supporting it – to make the concept of unpredictability of warfare, don’t appear in the same place again and again, almost like issuing an article – it’s our practice.”
Reported that the earliest attempts to this new practice was the "Harry Dorumen" Seaplane Combat Group, an early deployment of the battle group included access to the port's work and a tour of the area usually only.
More than ever, the American Navy is working hard to ensure that allies know that the military will still be on a traditional area tour, and is also addressing the logistical and family contact issues for the new deployment process.
Australia's Royal Navy Commander Michael Nunan will also be speaking during this event, saying that the Australian army can work with the U.S. Marine Corps.

Executive Director of the Australian Federation of Science and Industry Research Organization: The Results of Australia-China Technology Co-operation
“ The science and technology of China has developed rapidly over the past decade, and Australia and China can achieve results in the scientific field. ”
Larry Marshall, Australia’s chief executive of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Group, said in Beijing that the cooperation between climate change and the “Skyeye” project has been alive in Australia’s technology sector.
As the largest national research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has extensively achieved innovative research results in areas such as oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and more.
CSIRO has maintained a close cooperative relationship with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“It’s a lasting friendship that encompasses the trust of partners and the tradition of long-term cooperation,” Marshall said.
This May, China’s 500m mouthball face-to-air mirror – “China’s celestial eye” installed the first 19-band L-band receiver in China.

“Strengthening cooperation, for us to speak mainly about technology cooperation ”
Marshall, CSIRO recently developed a gold tipping method that does not use cyanide, because traditional cyanide gold tipping method for environmental hazards, many countries want to find a small environmental pollution gold tipping method.
“We would like to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the results we have achieved in our partnership with ‘the Belt and Road’.” ”

Mr. Lee said on Saturday that he would continue to impose sanctions on the United Nations to deepen his distrust in the United States, and that it would not be possible for Mr. Lee to squash nuclear weapons in such a way.
Li Yonghao said at the United Nations General Assembly that he has taken a "very friendly practice" in the past year, including stopping the missiles and nuclear testing, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing to non-dispersed nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any corresponding responses from the United States, ” he says.
“If we don’t trust the United States, we don’t have confidence in our national security, and in this case, we can’t just let go of weapons first.”
While Lee Yonghao is repeating a complaint against the United States against the de-nuclearization of the "stage of division", his words have a great significance, because there was not been a complete rejection of the de-nuclearization as opposed to the previous situation.
Mr. Lee mentioned Mr. Kim Jong-un and Mr. Trump’s June 12 joint statement that Mr. Kim agreed to commit to protecting the North Korean security in an effort to “de-nuclearize”.
North Korea has been seeking to officially end the 1950-53 North Korea War, but the United States says that North Korea must first release nuclear weapons.
The United States also declined to relax its request for sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States stands for ‘nuclearization first,’ and increases its sanctions to achieve its purpose in a high-security way, and even refuses to publish the ‘War End Declaration’,” Mr Li said.
“I think that sanctions can make us look after the idea that we don’t know who we are doing daydream.
But the problem is that this persistent sanctions are deepening our distrust. ”
Mr. Lee did not mention the United States president's second Union plan this week earlier in the United Nations.
Instead, he emphasized Kim Jong-un and the South Korean presidential text in the past five months three times and said, “If the other side of de-nuclearization is South Korea rather than North Korea, then de-nuclearization of the peninsula will not become so rigid.”

The Office of the Customs and Excise Committee of the State Council of the People's Republic of China on the relevant content, the above four autonomous tax cuts, and July 1, this year, according to the information technology agreement to greatly determine the results of the third step of the implementation of the tax cut, will make China's overall level of Customs from 9.8% last year to 7.5 %.
Adjusted the overall level of the relevance is slightly higher than the European Union, lower than most developing countries, in moderate low levels, with China's development status and development stage of basic matching.
The introduction of the state, the overall level as an important indicator of China's level of trade in goods, should be compatible with the Chinese economic development stage, reflecting the characteristics of the times.
China's largest commodity trade scale in the world, has developed a further expansion of the economic base, but the quality and benefits of trade development compared with the development of the economy is still a gap, therefore, should be appropriate to reduce the total level of taxes.
Customs is a combination of protection tools, the level of relevance should be compatible with industrial competitiveness, to encourage good sexual competitiveness, over-protection is not conducive to industrial development and improve quality.
The cut-off tax rate adjusts to both production needs and consumption needs.
Focused on reducing domestic demand, help to upgrade the industry's commodity tax rate, efforts to increase the people's demand compared with centralized access to premium products, and continuously enhance the sense of corporate and public access to meet the upgrading needs of industrial structure and consumer structure.
Decline the strength of fiscal revenue and industrial development to dominate the affordability.

Serbia announced its entry into the highest war in the future President of Russia will meet tomorrow to discuss Kosovo's office
The South China news agency quotes the President of Serbia as saying that the Kosovo Special Forces accounted for the passage of the water lakes at the Can Vauda Power Station, controlled by Belgrade in northern Kosovo, and the President of Serbia's Wuche ordered the armed forces to enter the highest battle status.
On September 29, Serbian Secretary of Defense Wulin declared that the Serbian forces had entered a full-fledged battle.
Wulin, as long as the command released by Wuchi is still valid, Serbia will continue to maintain control of the current Kosovo department, regardless of the direction of the development of the situation, the army will respond.
According to the Russia-Tass Agency, on September 29, Wujiki said in his acceptance that he had communicated his current situation with various parties such as the United States and Europe, and that he would be going to Moscow to the Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 2 to seek Putin's support on the issue of Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needed support for a Russian military like Syria, Wuchi gave a negative reply: “I don’t want major conflicts in our land.”
Wuchiki also said that the army entered a comprehensive war in the fight is just to form a threat to stop the occurrence of conflict, but this is also a clear warning: it will not tolerate any violence in Kosovo.
The reasons for the rise of the military are related to two major drivers in Kosovo.
In accordance with the Serbian law, the Albanians are recently arrested for the generation of the Serbian people who live in the region of northern Kosovo, and these arrested Serbs do not guilty of any law.
According to Wuchi, since 26 March this year, the government of Serbia and the Mayochia office of the captivity of Marco Jurichi was attacked and detained by the Kosovo Ayat, the Ayatollah continued to escalate regional affairs and carried out inhumane arrests and seizures against the people of the country.
In addition, more than 100 people within the territory of the Republic of Kosovo's internal ministry of ROSU special forces, armed police, and sniper were declared on their own, taking part in the water lakes near the Canverada Hydro Station, entering the metropolis and sports center near the north of the north of the Kosovo region, and blocking all nearby roads, which were originally controlled by Serbia.
Wuchi noted that the action of this military adventure in Kosovo was made in the midst of Western countries, the drive of the Kosovo Army did not inform Serbia in advance, and opposed the first of the 9th chapter of the Brussels Protocol, but also the United Nations Security Council No. 1244 between the decision and the technical agreement of the military.
Wutchich has screamed to the Secretary-General of NATO, Stoltenberg, criticizing the rumors of Western countries on the issue of Kosovo.
The roots of this conflict are still the roots of centuries of history between the two peoples of the Séa family in the Kosovo region.
There are various ways of saying about the fall of Kosovo, the Serbs and the Arles.
Serbia v. Kosovo's place for the nation and its culture, as Serbia established its own most powerful country in the 12th century, and the Aristocrats were only invaluable after the Ottoman invasion and the absurd return of the North.
It is believed that the Eryrians who lived in Kosovo in the 4-5th century B.C. were the ancestors of the Aryrians, and therefore Kosovo was the territory of the Aryrians since ancient times.
The main political division of the conflict of different ethnic, religious and cultural strife resulted in fierce opposition between the Serbs and the A.R. in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, Kosovo's Aristocrats first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of Argentinian people living in the Balkans traveled to Turkey, the proportion of the Seychelles rose relatively, in the Cypriot sees the "just return to their own land" practice, was regarded by the Argentinian people as the "Great Serbian" burden, the two-ethnic contradictions intensified.
Kosovo has become the Balkan’s “fire bucket”.
In 1999, the Albanian separatists clashes with the Serbian forces and police in the Kosovo Liberation Army, leading to a bombing of the NATO forces in the South League of Serbia and Montenegro, and a bombing of the Kosovo War.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008.
Later, it was reported that Serbia would normalize its relationship with Kosovo and to sign a global and legally binding agreement, but due to historical national hardship and political hardship, it was not possible to conclude a deal with the forces of the United States, Europe, and Russia.
And just one month ago, for the first time, Wujici made it clear that the main people of Kosovo were separated from the A.R., and that the two contradictions were made public again.

The experts of the national inorganic momo and research and exchange activities came into the test field, and listened to the representatives of the Distinguished Fellow of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinwei Xia Xinghai (Jiangdan Xiaoyuan) is located in Xinjiang Shaya County's remembrance cotton cultivation test base, the remembrance cotton long-like, compared with the surrounding local film cotton is "not colored", a melting snow-white cotton satisfies the "open", and the quiet pillow.
From 27th to 28th September, the national remembrane cotton site and research and exchange activities are held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
I learned at the meeting that the 'middle cotton 619' and its supporting cultivation measures as the main membrane-free cotton technology system, the initial realization of the cotton field membraneization targets, reduce the pollution of the raw environment and raw cotton in Xinjiang cotton film, the membrane cotton polymer technology research and demonstration made significant progress.
Member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, well-known cotton breeder, the national modern industrial technology system cotton system of the national chief scientist Hsin-Ting Fellow to Zhejiang Lin University School Cooperation Committee of Zhejiang Foreign Affairs Committee to introduce the state of the growth of mucosal cotton.
“We have developed membrane-free cotton alloying technology to fully realize the earth-free film to plant cotton, and can solve the problem of smolder contamination in the bottom, to achieve green cotton. ”
Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said he was quick to introduce.
Xinjiang is the most important production and cotton area in China, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2017 the Xinjiang cotton cultivation surface is 3500 million, accounting for 61% of the national cotton surface.
Since the introduction of the earth film in 1982 in China, the various types of crop films in Xinjiang have reached more than 5000 million, and the ground film year uses about 30,000 spills.
Among them, cotton ground film coverage rate reaches 100%, and cotton film coverage accounts for about 60% of the use of films in Xinjiang.
Moisture cotton is tested, and the yield of cotton can be achieved completely from 320 kg to 350 kg.
With the continuous increase in the amount of Mainland film input in Xinjiang, low retention of land film recycling rate, the gradual increase in the amount of film film in soil, and the soil structure caused by a series of problems such as damage to the soil, which greatly affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The film not only causes significant pollution to the soil, but it also has a great impact on cotton fin quality.
At present, more than 1/3 of cotton harvesting in Xinjiang achieved mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang organic cotton facial about 1400 million million.
Machine cotton harvesting in the process of income of a large number of surface, the debris on the cotton strain, grinding in the original cotton debris in the process of raw cotton processing to be cleared, in the post-processing process can not be cleared in the bottom, seriously affect the quality of the product.
On September 28th, the national remembrane cotton site and research and exchange event was held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to work hard to solve the pollution of cotton field film, simplify cotton technology, improve cotton efficiency, metaphorically lead his team through 8 years, the implementation of the "middle cotton 619" membrane cotton technology cultivation, for the green development of the Xinjiang agricultural green wing.
metaphorically explained quickly, through the innovative breeding of new ideas, cultivate a new line of "middle cotton 619" of a ground-breaking, resistant, and low temperature, and produce.
“ ‘Zhongqing 619’ has achieved a series of supporting measures such as film-free plantation, deep-improvement of sowing seeds, underlined tubes of film conditions, suitable for the detection of sowing seed density, rational chemical control, etc., under the conditions of membrane-free planting. ”
At present, Aksu, Kurler, Aral and other places have established a membrane-free cotton demonstration base, with a production capacity of 4800 kg per hectare.
Moisturizing cotton, to achieve fertilization, saving, environmental protection, comprehensive efficiency to improve.
Xinjiang production and construction of the third medical organization, the third scientific organization of the rush ocean, through nearly six years of membrane cotton cultivation technology research and demonstration, the production of membrane cotton is completely able to produce 320 kg to 350 kg, and may even be higher.
“The promotion of membrane cotton cultivation technology is very promising. ”
We believe that at the moment, the film-based cotton cultivation technology can solve the problem of soil semen pollution in the bottom, but the current economic benefits compared to the local film cultivation there is a certain gap.
“The support of cotton’s acquisition price will benefit the future promotion. ”
metaphorically, the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research on membrane cotton and the general promotion of the application, the membrane cotton this industry is made strong, and solve the soil contamination caused by the ground membrane problem.

The European Union may enter into a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The U.S. government recently claimed that in November it would reconcile new sanctions against Iran, and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iran's oil.
But allies in the United States don’t seem to hear it.
According to the U.S. New York Times, on 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif was interviewed to reveal that while the U.S. threat will sanction any country doing business with Iran, Tehran and the European Union are approaching a deal on the sale of crude oil.
The core purpose of this protocol is to attempt to establish a new payment mechanism, that is, to replace the dollar transactions in an easy-to-use or currency-based way of pricing.
The purpose of this method is to pass through the United States and prevent the transfer of U.S. money from obstruction.
At the same time, although the European Union is committed to the cooperation, but some French and British officials also have a desire, if the agreement is implemented, it will be against the U.S. withdrawal of the I nuclear agreement between the EU and the U.S. the most public confrontation.
The media said that in an hour’s feature, Zarif’s language sounded more fun than it had been in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to “leave” the traditional allies of the United States, effectively breaking the U.S. attempts to cut Iran’s income.
“This ensures that we sell oil and benefit from it,” Zarif believes that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran under the 2015 agreement.
“Any sovereign country or organization cannot accept the decision of others, and you can trade with them.”
However, she also predicts that before the U.S. government to carry out the next sanctions in November, U.S. leaders may take a series of financial means, aimed at the business with Tehran banks, businessmen and countries.
In May this year, the U.S. government announced to withdraw from the Inucleus Agreement unilaterally and said that it would not permanently ban Iran’s production of nuclear fuel.
The United States has subsequently banned companies that buy Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat has caused some companies to evacuate Tehran and Iran's currency to plummet.
Airbus and French oil giant Dodal and other companies have cancelled dozens of dollars on I-Invest.
The United Kingdom and French officials have said that the U.S. government may be “occupied”.
No, according to a recent Turkish media report, US sanctions do not seem to have a significant impact on Iran’s oil exports.
The Iranian oil minister revealed a day ago that no country other than South Korea ceased to buy Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Ruhani believe that the U.S. has a series of actions aimed at "discussed" Iranian anti-corruption.
Zarif also feels embarrassed to the United States a string of attacks on the United States when asked whether or not the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with an insignificant financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, “It is a regime-altering strategy that is the real purpose of the United States.”

Access Nagoya Nov. 5 – The central bank expects the long-term implementation of a super-easy monetary policy that could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and could break the stability of the national bank system, the former president of the Bank of Japan said Monday.
But he said that the central bank of Japan needs to maintain its large-scale stimulus program while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies.
“Japan’s central bank fully admitted that the strength of the financial institution will be influenced by the ever-increasing demands of the economy,” Kuroda said in a speech to the business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if the financial institutions are more committed to the risk, the low interest rate over the years caused by the impact of narrow profit rate, once there is a serious negative, the banking system may be dynamic.
“Although these risks are not significant at the moment, the central bank will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures,” he said.
The meeting of the Bank of Japan earlier Monday shows that at the September meeting, the Bank of Japan’s policy committee discussed the cost of long-term relaxation policy continues to rise.
The meeting records show that a member says, if the economy persists, “the Bank of Japan will have more space in terms of policy in the future.”
Meeting records show that another member said that during the period of policy continuity, there are limitations, and the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the stimulus policy.
The Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks brought by its relaxed policies, and at the same time, it is necessary to consider the uncertainty of the prospects of the Japanese economy, which may affect the global demand due to the friction of trade between the United States and China and the increasing protectionism.
“The impact of this issue on the Japanese economy is limited in time, ” Kuroda Oyushu said.
“But how the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy may change, ” he added.
“It is necessary to continuously make strong monetary and easy policies, while taking into account both paraphrasing and negative effects in a balanced way,” Kuroda East said.
Despite the increasing drawbacks of the aggressive stimulus program, such as long-term low interest rates induced financial institutions, the deficient combustion has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
Bank of Japan last month maintained its monetary policy; Kuroda eliminated the possibility of recent rate hikes in the face of the global trade war.

Through the "Window", people see the "Open China" to a higher level; With the "Window", the world and "Open China" are welcome to win.
“For a country, open like breaking a butterfly, will experience a moment of pain, but will be transformed into a new birth. ”
President Xi Jinping, the summary of the road to opening up, taught the 'Why China' is an important reason.
Looking back to the reform and opening up for 40 years, dare to enter the world's market, the sea of China, dare to meet through spillage and surf, but always in an open position face all the challenges, continue to release internal vitality, continue to improve the competitiveness.
It can be said that China with its own practical achievements, a strong explanation of the value and meaning of openness.
Standing at the beginning of the new history, to import the theme of the fair, with close comrades as the core of the central party focused on advancing a new level of openness to make a major decision, is China's proactive to the world open market major measures, is China's support for economic globalization and trade liberalization of the actual action, showing that "China's opening doors will not be closed, will only open more and more great" strong and clear intentions.
And the exhibitors to sign up, the booth "A obligatory", is the largest recognition and best response to China's development of an open economy in greater range, more space, and more depth.
More importantly, the current global order of business went to a crossroads.
Some countries raise the high level of trade protectionism, return the old road of monopolisticism, increasing the international community's prospects for free trade, but also to the warming world economy adds a lot of uncertainty.
In the context of this era, the controversy on the banks of the Huangpu River, reflecting China's defense of free trade, so that the world sees the open market, share the future of China's confidence and Chinese rivalry.
It's easy to get around.
China has opened up its minds and embraced the world, and has not only facilitated its own development, but also brought great opportunities for China to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, advocate and promote the establishment of the Belt and Road Initiative, the establishment of the China Foundation............ China provides a series of international public products, provides a practical export market, development opportunities and employment positions, so that enterprises of all countries can take the development of "fast-track" "improvement" in China.

From a more macro perspective, the idea of the fair has exceeded the paradigm of economy and trade, but the future, open, inclusive, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, win-win concept, the formation of a common sense to today's challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.

Reuters Hong Kong Nov 5 - The price of the Hong Kong Gold Price fell after two consecutive months, according to the Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. David Shau on Monday, said that it will take time to see if the market has entered the downward cycle. If it is confirmed, you can consider the recovery policy for the relaxation of the recyclability measures at the time.
Shen said that if the price is back, the first of the impact will be on the people who home during the peak of the building, but it is expected to appear such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis when the price fell sharply, the public's chance to sell the property significantly lower.
According to a number of HKMA executives at the Legislative Council Briefing Session, if the listed markets enter the fall cycle, they can give timely relaxation measures.
“But now only a few weeks of data is seen, relaxation is still too early, but it still takes some time to see if the city enters the next cycle. ”
Since 2009, the HKMA has launched eighty-second cycle measures to maximize the collection of mortgages of various types of properties, including the reduction of mortgage ratios, the mortgage applicant has passed the pressure test, etc., in order to improve the management and seismic resistance of bank risk.
As Hong Kong enters the rate hike cycle, the Hong Kong Private Housing Prices Index fell in 8-9 months, with the month-on-month decline widening to 1.44% in September.
But the first three quarters of this year still saw a cumulative increase of 10.2%.
According to the HKMA data, family financial situation of Hong Kong's resilience to financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the homeless household ratio of Hong Kong households with no mortgages reached 66%, which is higher than the average 60% in 2009-11; the new mortgage average ratio and the contribution rate and income ratio of newly approved mortgages were 47% and 34%, respectively, and 64 percent and 41% respectively, respectively, were significantly improved in 2009-11.
But Mr. Shen said that the high shock resistance does not mean that the owners of the property will not be harmed by the downward economy, because the property valuation will fall, in the peak of the people who buy them will first throw it.
Although the HKMA receives bank loan from mortgage borrowers, but homebuyers can also obtain a high percentage of mortgage loan through mortgage insurance or through the developer's mortgage loans.
The mortgage loan provided to the developer is currently available to borrowers up to 85-90%, according to Mr. Haldeer. If the price falls by 10%, the assets will appear (i.e., the market value of the property falls below the total level of the unmaintained mortgage loan).
However, the HKMA vice president Nguyen Guo Heng pointed out that the authorities estimate that the high percentage of mortgages provided by the developer, accounting for only 2-2.5% of the total mortgages, the proportion is still low.
In 2003, during the peak period of Hong Kong's assets, the number of assets exceeded 10 million, accounting for 22% of people in the supply chain.
And as of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong has recorded zero assets in the seventh quarter of the year.

Systemic lupus necrosis is a chronic suspected disease of a tired and systemic polysaccharides, which was previously considered as a "distortion".
Because of its unknown mechanism of disease, the diagnosis and treatment of doubts, the lack of effective treatment methods shall not be cured.
Recently, the UN team found the presence of human immunoglobulins to increase the systemic erythematosus susceptibility molecular molecule, the researcher of Tsinghua University School of Life Sciences, Shuangli, and the director of the Beijing University Hospital People's Hospital Wind Immunization Center, and this variant participated in the control of immune cells B.
In short, the two teams confirmed that a common immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic macular seizures.
According to one of the authors of the article, the Northern Great People's Hospital of the North People's Drowning, the National Team collected nearly 2000 cases of systemic macular necrosis patients and conducted research, found that patients with immunoglobulin mutations produce disease-causing cells and types of broad, a large number of their own antibodies, inflammatory, arthritis, meneitis, vascitis, and other inflammation of the incidence and degree of a significant increase.

It is not a short-term, but a matter according to law.
Will the lawyer bring an axe to the Court?
The message was indeed very stimulating, but also opened up in the legal circle.
Since the law in the city of Quanzhou, the Law Association of Quanzhou has investigated the Law Association of Quanzhou.
According to the Xinjing report, the previous Quanzhou City law issue official notice, the behavior of two lawyers does not involve the law, according to law not be anywhere.
From a multi-party newspaper, the treatment of the City of Quanzhou law is not short or engage in confrontation, but got the approval of the Quanzhou Middle School.
Together, it may lead to events within the legal community, which will eventually be properly resolved.
The retrospectiveness of things stems from a more complete truth: involving the law in which the client carries the same model, the same model, but not opened, only in the certification of evidence to aid the end, and without fear or 'destroying the safety of the court' main intention.
Judging whether the law involved in the conduct of the law, there are four very important details need attention: First, two court cases before the local court, only show a head photo, from the perspective of care, showing the original matter is necessary; Second, the head is only one hour before the court to buy, not the law does not seek the consent of the judge, but the objective can not contact the judge, and three, the whole of the matter has not been motivated or not used, and the fourth, the law involved the first time the public opinion, and the court expressed an apology.
In combination with these episodes, you can see that the lawyer involved "with an amazement" does not matter, but in order to protect.
After the clearing of the whole facts, the Quanzhou city law does not have a sled raft, but the sled pressure made the decision not to do anything.
And that decision also takes place in the experience of facts and laws.
As for the absence of a court license, it is brought to the court as a control tool, which is indeed prone to anxiety and explanation.
For safety and prudent consideration, there were no previous proposals and judicial proposals from Quanzhou Middle School.
In order to protect the law firm and to prevent the death of individual courts, the highest law in 2014 issued the "People's Court Judicial Police Security Review Rule", to establish the law firm court does not need to conduct personal safety checks.
Since the release of the rule, the barristers have committed themselves, rarely due to security loopholes and thus endanger the court security of the incident.
In the case of a very different situation similar to Quanzhou, as long as the spirit of mutual respect and understanding is communicated, deciphered and dissolved.
As a self-regulatory body in the law firm industry, the Law Society undertakes a serious mission to practice and protect the law.
In the past, individual legal associations were affected because of their emphasis on being obsessed, and because of their loss of protection.
The decision of the law of Quanzhou, whether it is from the process or the results, are worthy of praise, for more of the law of the correct performance set the list.

Three countries began the process of judging this from 2017.
The pre-emptive decision of Yung-Mung-Mong to announce the results in the early morning of the local time, against the success of Yucheng Danny, who plans to move the site in Myanmar.
The selection was voted on September 30, and the final result showed that Yucheng won 39.663 million votes, winning the best of his history, more than 8 million votes of its main runner-up.

Since the mid-2000s, Paul Thomas, a U.S. resident of North Dakota, has grown more and more soybeans in China than ever before, with the growing demand for oil seeds.
This shift reached its peak this year, and he reached an unprecedented scale of 1,600 acres in 5,000 acres of soybeans.
But Thomas and a lot like him planned to convert the main crops of former American agricultural regions in 2019: Corn and Wheat.
American farmers this year's soybean grow face out of corn, for the first time since 35 years.
The reason why other cooking crops are planned is because in the context of the President Trump's trade war against China, the American people are selling soybeans in trouble.
China usually buys about 60% of U.S. exports of soybeans, but because of the trade war, almost every few months to buy U.S. soybeans, resulting in the price of soybeans fell to a decade low.
Thomas intends to have more wheat in the next year, and hopefully, by reducing the dependency on crops that are in demand in China, can be a little more.
Thomas said the soybean price "to bring us a painful fight".
He said that without China buying demand, the spot price of soybeans near its farm is $7.10 per ear, and the price required for covering the cost is $8.50.
This year, U.S. customers have reached a record high in soy plantation, and the harvest is expected to hit a record high.
This is a moment that is easy to be beaten and they meet the fight of trade war.
Trump on import of Chinese goods plus tax, China on import of American soybean added imports in July Customs.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report on the next year's plantation area, which will contain considerations for the impact of the tax.
The estimates will confirm the expectations of the private sector on soybean species will be reduced.
According to a report by Reuters, Informa Economics forecast to increase 4% to 9,270 million acres in 2019 (3,750 million hectares), and soy growers will reduce 7% to 8,300 hectares.
Informa also expects 4% increase in US wheat cultivation area.
Soybeans grown before the implementation of recurrent tariffs rose to 8,960 million acres this year, 10 years ago to about 1,500 million acres.
Since 2008, the corn cultivation surface has increased by less than 500 million acres, to 8,910 million acres, this year the corn cultivation surface of 4,780 million acres, nearly 100 years of minimum level.
Aron Carlson, President of the Corn Plantation Association in Illinois, has a total plantation area of 3,600 acres, which is nearly half used to grow soy, but plans to reduce in the future.
He said that he could increase the corn cultivation area by up to 20% on his farm in northern Illinois; the state is the largest soy growing state in the United States.
Soy is lower than corn per British single, but less fertilizer is needed, which makes soybean overall to address the cost of growing.
If the customer moves to final corn, it may be possible to increase costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc.
Andersons’ CEO Pat Bowe told Reuters that he expects to convert corn to fertilizer to be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the transfer of corn to the client.

Why not prevent its immoral or even illegal behavior, but after the thing can be done on it?
And for the irrational act of "hegemony", how can it be just a male passenger "way is not flat" and it rises?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with a passenger police, short-haul trains generally do not have; even if there is a passenger police, the passenger police are more likely to travel to the hegemony in spite of the no-resistance and did not take forced measures.
The occurrence of the hegemonic event makes people aware that the hegemonic event must be forced to be taken away or even placed in order to play a shock.
This requires that our train travel police dare to take powerful measures in a timely manner, and trains without police should be configured as soon as possible, in order to ensure timely suppression and crackdowns.
