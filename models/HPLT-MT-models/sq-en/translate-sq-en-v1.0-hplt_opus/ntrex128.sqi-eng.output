Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned that they "look like fools"
Among some members of the Assembly is a concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This came as a result of plans to change the assembly's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could fuel ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "cash."
A Welsh MP said the entire group was "dissatisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "stupid."
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter "w" in Welsh is similar to that of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee currently drafting the name change legislation said: "Of course the final decision on the nomination of the Members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh government's 2017 law gave the Welsh assembly the tagrin to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and the latter's proposal for naming the assembly as the "Parliament of Wales" found broad support.
Regarding the issue of the title of the Assembly Members, the Commission favoured the name "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMP," but the alternative "MWP" found more support in a consultation with the public.
It appears that members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative elections, but the fight for consensus could turn into a setback for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules for the exclusion of Assembly Members and the structure of the committee system.
During the legislative discussion, the final vote on the issue of their appointment will remain with the members of the Assembly.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The vote by the people was decided in an attempt to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim over its territory and has consistently rejected its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on changing the name, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St Martin's bells fall silent as churches in Harlem face difficulties
Historically, the older people I talked to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," Adams said.
I miss both of them today.
He said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
Nowadays, people socialize in other ways," he says.
Bars are no longer the meeting points of the neighborhood, where people go regularly.
In terms of churches, he expressed concern that the money from selling properties will not last as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential mansions full of people who will not support the holy sites that remain in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy dwellings in these palaces are white," he said, "so the day will soon come when these churches will close once and for all, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who settle in these houses will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of black people - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists was transferred in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a congregation of black people who had their place of worship nearby.
St. Martin passed a congregation of black people under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority traders on the 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for the reconstruction, they commissioned the carion.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the karyon "the bell of poor people."
The expert who played in the karyon in July called it something else entirely: "a cultural treasure" and an "inevitable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said that this was the first carion in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carion in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin had not replaced him.
The events of recent months in St. Martin have been a complex tale of architects and contractors, some sent by secular church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Council - the leading body of parish, composed of secular leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, with concern that it would "try to transfer costs" to the parish council, despite the latter being not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishists complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old shark injured during a plunge to catch crabs in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to catch crabs in California on the day of the opening of the crab season, officials say.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then drove towards him along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought the boy was just exaggerated by the capture of a crab, but then "I realized that he was screaming 'bitch me!'
He bites me!"
Hammel says that when he arrived at the boy, he saw that his entire clavicle was torn.
I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was declared in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast guard captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was defined as a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries on the upper body.
Officials banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is competing Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with large-store-style cosmetic pavilions, with a specialist sales staff.
In the framework of a significant effort to enter the UK's £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which is continuing to grow as sales of fashion clothing and household furnishings decline, the largest cosmetic pavilions will be tested in 11 stores around the country and spread to more stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves that were once used for televisions, microwaves and home furnishings.
Sainsbury's has said it would double its cosmetic product offering of up to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Even existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with dedicated areas for relevant brands, similar to those in stores like Boots.
Also, the supermarket will launch its own cosmetics line Boutique, so that most of the products are vegan-made - something that is increasingly being sought by buyers of younger ages.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second one is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and a trend towards daily grocery shopping in small quantities in the neighborhood stores mean that now supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's, said the outlet will start to look more and more like big stores, as the supermarket network struggles to combat Aldi and Lidl's price cuts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has put Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced a series of "Habitats" since the acquisition of both networks two years ago, which he says has boosted sales of food products and made his purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a merger of companies with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger broke down after a debate over how to separate the proceeds from pharmacies in his supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for £125 million.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our cosmetics pavilions to improve the environment in favor of our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, which will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands is designed in such a way as to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations show that we are now a seductive cosmetic destination, which distinguishes us from the old way of making purchases.
Peter Jones "genius" after Holly Willoughby pulled out of the £11m deal
Dragons Den" star Peter Jones has left "genius" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11m deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home furnishings and accessories brand "Truly."
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" presenter turned to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has angered the Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, after the recent withdrawal from their lucrative business dedicated to a certain lifestyle - to focus on her promising new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "genius" when the golden daughter of television admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their home furnishings and accessories brand "Truly."
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was projected to double her estimated fortune to £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce her departure from "Truly," Jones has flown out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was definitely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term future that would accompany her over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw left all those involved absolutely stunned.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close to opening up.
In Marlow's offices there is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold.
Experts think that the departure of the "This Morning" presenter, who is among the UK's most successful stars, could cost the firm millions, due to significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, and cause further delays in its opening.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as its director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together and Jones has 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity's ITV presenter.
Last night, a source close to Jones said: "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
It's a tough conversation and then we fell in love.
He made a joke about the criticism he would receive from the news media because of a comment from him, which some would call "unworthy of a president," and because of the positivity associated with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by mocking the voice of the news presenters.
I didn't give up at all.
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying the North sees no "corresponding reaction" by the US to the first steps taken by North Korea on denuclearization.
On the contrary, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping under pressure.
Trump held a much more optimistic outlook on his rally speech.
Things are going well with North Korea," he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - the cessation of missile testing, aid in the release of hostages and the return home of the remainder of the U.S. military.
In his speech on relations with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
It's very simple to behave like president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national catastrophe was declared, which is a precondition for the catalyzing of international aid.
Unfortunately, they have made it clear on many occasions that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a bit challenging," Ms. Sumung said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known for sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Given the frequent shaking of the land that Indonesia suffers, the country remains highly unprepared in the face of the wrath of nature.
While shelters against the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are hardly found in other coastal areas.
The apparent absence of a mermaid for warning of the tsunami in Palu, despite a warning being issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of conditions, traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for the treatment of the earthquake victims is travelling to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo used the improvement of Indonesia's lame infrastructure as the focal point of his election campaign, and has invested generous amounts of money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has worried Joko's administration, as he faces new elections next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of trust.
More than 1000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes following clashes between Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where machete, bows and arrows have been used, and other cold weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores in the last minutes a equaliser goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards away from Chelsea's gate, while his team was losing 1-0.
He pushed the ball easily to his left before making a shot at the far gate.
The ball flew over the area as it drifted towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball escaped the jump in the air of Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
The goal was to put myself in the right position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play ball ahead, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch and I didn't think too long but I just hit.
Chelsea led 1-0 in the first half, after a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward made a comeback to Mateo Kovacic during that game, before turning to the pitch and sprinting towards Liverpool's semi-field.
Kovacic made a quick combination in midfield.
He then gave a beautiful vertical pass that Hazard took to the area.
Hazard passed the defence in the speed duel and with a shot with the left scored on the second pole, passing the ball behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami death toll has risen to 832, the national disaster agency said in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have been trapped under the rubble of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude quake that struck Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, has been cremated under the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is found dead by knife wound
A murder investigation has been launched after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
Police have called on residents of the area who have seen or heard anything to appear for evidence.

I would also like to call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured film footage, to contact us as they may have important information about our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is resident of Birkenhead and her body has been found inside a flat.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived on stage to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, as police say they are alerting the victim's family.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but has been informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out about the incident.
Now, residents are being notified that they will be allowed to enter their homes in just a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has arrived in the scene of the crime.

At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter and another van was outside.
A number of officers were positioned inside the perimeter, monitoring the block of residence.
Any person who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by selecting the 247 code of 30 September.
Cromwell statue in Parliament, the most recent monument affected by the debate about "rewriting history"
Its abolition would be a well-deserved punishment for the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his Puritan fanatical followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "effort to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the midst of the current debate over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster was betrothed.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be Cromwell's wrong sacrifice for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
The brilliant portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the story of a figure that many think still deserves to be lauded.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from outside pressure, which, in his case, was the monarchy.
The fact that this is a fully accurate portrayal is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure who represents a side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.
Man killed by Chinese farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a fractured artery and covered in blood near a pig stall in the Liupanshiu market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is getting ready to be injected with swine vaccines in a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He was said to have travelled with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a nearby open pig stall.
He said there was a large male pig in the stall with a blood-stained mouth.
A forensic examination has confirmed that the £550 pig has injured the farmer to death, according to the report.
My cousin's feet were bloodthirsty and crippled," his cousin, identified with the surname "Wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang.
In footage filmed by the security camera, Yuan was seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig had been kept in isolation to prevent another attack, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people being attacked by pigs have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a £650 pig caught a Welsh farmer after his tractor, until his wife drove out the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "booster."
They just want to play.
They are like curious little ones... their goal is not to hurt you.
You just have to show respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to bring heavy rainfall across the U.S. Southwest
As predicted, the power of Hurricane Rosa is waning as it moves in the direction of the coldest waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m. east, Rosa was accompanied by winds at 85 miles per hour, being classified as Category 1 hurricane and located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward towards the US West Coast. As Rosa is expected to approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will continue to push heavy tropical humidity toward its north, towards the southwestern US.
On Monday, Rosa will cause rainfall of up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Later, the interaction of tropical humidity with the low-pressure area will cause heavy rain in the south-west during the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall with a height of 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, debris leaks and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of precipitation is forecast in some areas of the southwest, mostly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of rapid worsening of conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
Due to the risk of tropical rainfall, it is not advisable to walk through the desert.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into powerful rivers, and storms will bring strong winds and dust storms into the area.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring heavy rainfall to parts of California's southern coast.
The total rainfall level can reach over half an inch, which can cause small waste flows and slippery roads.
For the region, this will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain falls expand on Monday and Tuesday night.
Strong rainfall will spread to all four sides on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October in the U.S. can be characterized by high temperature fluctuations, with temperatures falling in the Arctic, while tropics remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperatures at short distances.
A good example is the drastic difference in temperatures across the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good portion of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to start October with warmer temperatures, with an average of 80, from the Southern Fields to certain parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, the temperature which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high odds of temperatures above average in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people have followed through six TV networks the interesting testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, and broadcasters disrupted regular programs to broadcast the last minute of Friday's events: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and tried to strip him off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an incendiary testimony, said he was 100 per cent certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that the number of followers has been greater than that of 20.4 million, reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility on CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Figures for other streaming networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems with the count of viewers from the office.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football qualifier or that of the Academy Awards.
Fox News channel, which has strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high even after the end of the court hearing.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he confronted protesters' screams as he tried to get into the elevator to go to the court session of the Judiciary Committee.
On CNN's live broadcast, he appeared staring down for a few minutes as he was rebuked.
I'm standing here, right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
He was told, "You have the power, while there are so many helpless women."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee session.
Hours later, all cable and satellite networks were directly covering the moment when the Judiciary Committee would vote for Kavanaugh's candidacy to pass before all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so with the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the following week, as the Democratic minority had demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election was smart, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has called for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the newspaper's home page, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the assault on her Brexit plan, the so-called "Chequers," saying the proposal for Britain and the EU to tax each other is "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims murder: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and interrogated at prison facilities on charges of indiscriminate murder, the Baton Rouge Police Directorate said.
Official sources have released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say the Sims had lost his glasses during the clash.
Police have found the glasses at the scene and say they have found traces of Simpson's DNA in them, CBS's WAFB affiliate reports.
Following Simpson's interrogation, police said he admitted to firing weapons on Wayde causing his death.
The amount for his release has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
Baton Rouge's Eastern Municipality Legal Doctor's Office issued a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound from head to neck.
The department thanks the task force of the fugitives to the Louisiana State Police, the state police's criminalistic laboratory, the Southern University police and the people of the area for helping with the investigation that led to the author's arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement authorities for "their zeal and for bringing justice to the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot 6-inch boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had played basketball for the LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 shots for each game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "sad" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
That's what I worry about all the time," Wade said.
The volcano pours ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popcatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was re-awakened and 183 bursts of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center had monitored a series of thunder and shakings.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash that had covered car windows in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in volcano activity, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a clash of pro-independence protesters with police forces, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peacekeeping police forces, hit eggs and paint powder by creating dark clouds of dust across the streets that are usually glaring at tourists.
Later in the day there were fights, and the police had to use rubber sticks to end the clashes.
For several hours in a row, repeating the slogan "We don't forget, we don't forgive," pro-independence groups faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where pro-independence sentiments prevail, tensions remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, despite the fact that turnout was low, as citizens opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday night, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued, but was forced to take another course.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the separatist protest along with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would gain independence in the future.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital victory in last December's local elections, although with close results, Catalan pro-independence parties have found it difficult to maintain momentum this year, as many of their most popular leaders have either voluntarily left the country or are in detention and awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in aid of the police, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison pending trial since the end of last year, said he would run for the European Parliament next year.
The casting of the candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the repression that has been done to us by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Some people arrested after the car collided with the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said injuries were caused at the main gate and in the apartment itself.
It is thought that at some point an arrow was thrown in the direction of the car.
Menga's blow to Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
The team came from a category below, Livingston surprised Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as team coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's stroke proved decisive as Gary Holt's team drew second-placed Hibernian points.
Gerrard's team has not yet won an off-field meeting in the Premiership, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which there are eight points.
But before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League match on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the series of consecutive wins to six meetings and coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances in the face of undefeated opponents
Holt's team should have taken advantage many minutes before scoring, as their direct attacks caused Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson managed to cross but hit poorly at the gate, while then Alan Lithgow hit off the slide after being handed over by Craig Halkett.
The locals were willing to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems in standard kicks.
And that's how the goal was scored that set the meeting.
Rangers caused a penalty kick and Livingston created the space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined by creating the opportunity for Menga, who hit and scored in the center of the area.
By that time, Rangers had dominated the ball but the domestic defence had proved impassable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had never been put to the test.
This way of playing continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a reception.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped on foot by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor while Lithgow hit off from another standard shot of Livingston.
The arches repeatedly came to the Livingston area and were repeatedly cleared, while two claims of penalty - following Halkett's intervention against the incoming player as a substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hand-held touch - were not taken into account.
The "phenomenal" game by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, they played brilliantly and continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
The style of the game and their team hasn't changed much since their return to the top, but a great deal of merit belongs to Holt for the way he has electrified the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, leading a perfectly organized defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they played very well under Gerrard, they lacked quality.
There was a lack of final pass - only once did they manage to pass the counter defense - and that's something that should serve as an alarm for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdoğan is expected with double feelings in Cologne
Saturday (29 September) was characterized by the smile of blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aimed to regulate relations between NATO allies.
They have fallen in opposition to issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police stopped gathering a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but many supporters took to the streets to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also raised their voices to condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposition protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor adored as a hero by some German Turks and despised as autocrats by others.
Deptford Road Accident: Cyclist Dies After Car Crash
A cyclist has died after crashing into a car in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestword Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the quick helpers arrived immediately, but the victim died at the scene.
The crash occurred months after another cyclist died in an accident where the perpetrator left the scene, which took place on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash site.
Police said officers were working to identify the person and alert his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have been announced to use other routes, while drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long High Prison: Six officers injured during a riot
Six prison officers have been injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
The rebellion broke out at HMP Long High in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and continues.
Tornado's specialist officers have been called in to contain the unrest, which involved eight inmates and who have been confined to one side of the prison.
Officers have received treatment at the scene for some minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "The prison staff with specialized training has been mobilized to keep the incident currently under control at HMP Long High.
Six staff members received treatment for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that the responsible persons will refer to the police and may receive an extension of the prison sentence.
HMP Long Martin hosts over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had undergone hospital treatment following an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, peacekeeping police officers were called to prison to keep a serious situation under control, where personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which may be an advantage for drought areas)
Although it rarely happens that a tropical depression hits Arizona, it is most likely exactly what will happen in the early days of next week, as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, spreading the risk of immediate flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of immediate flooding for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the late hours of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix tweeted: "Only ten tropical cyclones have received storm status or tropical depression at a radius of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches at Arizona's Mogollon border.
In other desert areas in the southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, rainfall is expected to be at 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's rainfall could be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods pose a serious concern, some of these rainfalls may be useful, as the Southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Center for drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme second-tier drought," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning, with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving northward at speeds of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is battling cold waters over the Pacific, losing power.
Consequently, it is expected that the hurricane will hit Mexico with tropical storm power on the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall over some areas of Mexico could be strong, posing a significant risk of flooding.
Rainfall at an average level of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to Sonora Northwest, and can reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
The main danger expected by Rosa or its aftermath is strong rainfall in Baja California, in northwestern Sonora, and in the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rainfalls are expected to cause immediate life-threatening flooding, waste flows in the desert and landslides in mountainous terrain.
The Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following the wounding of a 16-year-old man with a knife in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is currently in a "stable" condition.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officers have called for submission to anyone who may have captured the footage from the event by mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "faced humiliation and anger" by the Democratic Party
A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has faced the humiliation and outrage" of the Democratic Party during the process of appointing him.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, convincingly denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day "the American people witnessed the greatness, the qualities of character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most brilliant jurists of our time, a lawyer with a clean public service record," he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment during his speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not going to run, but I'm contributing," he said.
That's why I'm making so much effort and fighting for great candidates.
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to make "resistance and blockade."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP adviser told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami as numbers rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swallowed up by giant waves that collided on beaches when Indonesia's Sulawesi island was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six feet (18 feet) collided on the shore at dusk, devouring and causing the deaths of many and destroying everything came forward.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Yesterday, when the tsunami threat arose, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and therefore did not immediately run and fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster prevention agency, said in a press conference.
The tsunami did not come alone, it took cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Several people climbed the tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Peru.
The aerial photos published by the disaster agency showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The tremors after the earthquake continued to shock the coastal city on Saturday.
The quake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about triple the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which is located on the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have multiplied the power of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extraordinary" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Several bodies were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the extent of damage could be much larger along the 300km (90 miles) coastline north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication networks were "completely disrupted without any warning" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were travelling towards the affected areas.
This has already become a tragedy, but the situation can get worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticized for not giving notice of Palu's tsunami strike, despite officials saying the waves had come at the time of the warning.
In amateur films shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard warning passers-by down the road to the arrival of the tsunami with frantic screams.
Within a few minutes, a wave hit the shore, taking the buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami triggered a massive power outage, which cut off communications across Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people continue to have dire needs for food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only reopened for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
The situation is quite heavy.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived without problems in the city of Palu, where workers are sheltering in tarpaulin shelters in their office yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, Mr Doseba said.
They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is quite heavy.
Although aid groups began serious efforts to set in motion humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were being banned from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and external staff can only begin to circulate if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
This is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "O.K., this is a national catastrophe," we may seek national aid, but this status has not yet been granted.
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing persons still had the hope that the case of their loved ones would be one of the few miracles that ever happen in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a well.
On Saturday, rescue forces released a woman who had been trapped for two days with her mother's body next to herself.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paratrooper team, had trained two of the missing parachutes for the Asian Games, which were closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
As an old professional in the field of parachutism, I am very emotionally charged," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the parachuting community, he had desperately tried to write to WhatsApp competitors from Palu, who were attending the beach festival.
However, his messages ended up with only one sign of scaling in gray, rather than two blue markings.
I think that means the messages were not sent," he said.
Thieves steal $2,750 during the restocking of a Newport ATM in Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Directorate, on Friday morning, several thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was recharging a ATM in Newport, Levee.
The driver of the vehicle had been emptying a ATM at an entertainment center and was trying to distribute other money, Detective Dennis wrote in the statement.
While he was busy working, someone "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which went on sale in June.
The change came just before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi."
He will replace Ariana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current art name, West has said in the past that the word has a religious significance for him.
I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "ti," West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
So it's you, it's me, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one," to just "Ye," which is a reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West affiliate, JAY-Z, has done both with or without a separate visa and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed to "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, army troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were rising across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving students monthly subsidies and opening more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount spent on research in this area, says artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government announced artificial intelligence discoveries, despite the lack of an official general strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, it aims to take the top spot for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
The doubling of the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, as other countries are still far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in this area," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence being made in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order," which was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an artificial intelligence system that was passed on to the leading American player at Othello, and then worked as executive director at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's branch in China.
Lee congratulated the previous U.S. government competition on technology, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to help identify new visionaries.
Lee said that often, researchers in the U.S. have to work hard to get grants from the government.
It's not China that is removing academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
Over the past few years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired brilliant minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
I think green cards should be automatically given to people with the title of doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched the Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to people in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of the AI Selection Committee.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next."
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonia's people voted in a referendum to decide whether its name will be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that could resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked its efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, thinks its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim over its territory, and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout in the election will reach the 50 percent needed for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot reads: "Are you in favor of joining NATO and the EU through the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth being paid to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgieva, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum does not have binding powers, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will stick to the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last 2016 parliamentary election, with 66 per cent of registered voters casting their ballots.
I came to vote for the sake of my children, we have the country in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko cast their vote in a referendum on changing the name of Macedonia, which would pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and setting up a chair in front of the tents set up by the referendum boycotters.
We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not by entering from the back door," said Kavadarkov.
Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us by the name of Macedonia, we can address other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
I think the vast majority will be in favor, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would "confirm our future."
According to a poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - a figure below the necessary level of participation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma found that 57 percent of the participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
For a successful referendum, the turnout rate should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through all of Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced all of Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 65th minute goal look extremely easy.
The Argentine shooter took a pass in midfield at the start of the action.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before coming out on the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He crossed a defender and crossed the speed duel at the entrance to the Brighton area.
Then he went to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker took advantage of his exit to the area to pass the ball to Aguero, who hit right-back and beat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball into the right corner of the net.
Aguero is suffering from a problem with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball in Brighton's semi-field.
He perfectly verticalized for Laroy Sane on the left arm.
Sane advanced a few steps before moving on to Sterling in the second pillar.
The blue attacker took the ball to the net and then slipped off the border lines.
City will face Hofenheim on Thursday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to retain the role of "sniffing" against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the chance to reach the qualifiers, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Schezer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the chance to score against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff option for the Rockies, who have an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
The Rockies reached at least one playoff opportunity thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to get the division title.
Although we are playing without any motive, at least we can score by recognizing the atmosphere of the fans here in Denver but also the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level against which we can face throughout the year.
Why wouldn't I want to play like that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the starting line-up on Sunday, but are reportedly keen to leave Schezer in such a situation to start the meeting.
Schezer, for whom he would be the 34th appearance as a starter, held a training session on Thursday and could appear on the pitch on Sunday, which could be a normal day of rest for him.
The player from Washington, who shoots with the right, is 18-7 with a ERA 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3 of the shots this season.
Trump gathers West Virginia at the rally
The president referred to the situation with regard to his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
November is crucial for everything we have done so far.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest elections - I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible group of radical Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have made up their minds to regain power in any way, you see their wickedness and their filthiness.
They don't want to know who they hurt, who they press with their feet to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to.
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to make "resistance and blockade."
And you've seen this in the last few days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, cruel, nasty and treacherous."
He referred by name to the Democratic Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, which sparked outrage from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Wow, what?
No, no, no, I... wait a bit... her body language was pretty bad - it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an "open church."
She is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted for the motion of no confidence in me, I was not surprised.
After all, I'm not the first of the Labour Party MPs to be told they're not welcome - all because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly simply because he firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of no confidence was a criticism of me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, related to national security and to Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy contradicted previous leaders.
The announcement of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East said: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight-year period as a local MP of the Labour Party, the GC meetings have been the same.
Unfortunately, meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "softer and more polite" policy has long been forgotten, if ever existed.
It has become increasingly apparent that opposing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought I shared similar political views began to claim that I would take a 180-degree turn and take positions with which I would not have agreed - whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public - no matter what I say - criticism on social media, with people demanding my dismissal, denounce the policies of the center, tell me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And that's not just me.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but do not turn away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an "open church," and with every confidence motion and every change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more and more closed.
Over the past two years, I've been advised often to lower my head, not to be so loud, and that so "everything will go well."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago as a school student, driven by the disregard of Thatcher's government that led to my class failure at a general school, I have tried to lobby for better public services for those most in need - whether as a member of a local council or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East was clear about my political views and points of contention with the current leadership.
To all those who voted in favor of the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect our families, businesses and public services. I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually, the only message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not I am a member of the Labour Party: I am proud to be at your service and I promise you that no threat of dismissal or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr tops the charts
The two delayed attempts may have somehow changed the final result, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in the hugely entertaining Tenent's Premiership game today.
Now they top the lists as the only unbeaten team among the ten teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful defense and the courage to take risks that secured the victory for the local team, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be satisfied.
We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still invincible, so I'm normally happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, who took more risks than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, turned into a goal by Frazier Climo, passed Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, coming up for this challenge from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to show numerical superiority and Jason Baggot got an untapped ball.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first half, he scored and turned an individual action goal leading to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose did well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, turned to the goal by Baggoto, reduced the difference to five points.
Afterwards, there was a long break as a result of the severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left with the bareback, and after the game's restart, Ayr increased the score through a Stafford McDowall try, marked by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was then punished with a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the fact that they had one more player, with a goalless attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-pressed part.
However, the locals returned and when Strauss Hutchinson was punished with a yellow card because he prevented Climo, without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made "touch down", behind Ayr's back of the trio that was advancing forward.
Climo scored and did the same almost after the restart of the game, as Kyle Rowe grabbed the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led forward the striker (flanker) Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the domestic team.
Still Game star looks set for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game" star Ford Kieran appears set to enter the hotel industry after it was revealed that he has been named director of a licensed chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, with co-writer and co-protagonist his long-term partner in the comedy world, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that season nine will be their last for the show, and it appears Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was trying to enter Glasgow's "floating restaurant industry."
The sea is ours": Bolivia without access to the sea hopes the court will pave the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol an improvisation of the naval fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue ocean flag.
At sea bases from Lake Titicaca in the Amazon, the motto is: "The sea is our property.
His recovery is a task."
Across Bolivia without access to the sea, the memory of taking the coast from Chile in a bloody conflict for resources during the 19th century is still quite vivid - as is the desire to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are more likely than they have ever been for decades, while on October 1, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling after a five-year review.
Bolivia is characterized by momentum, the spirit of unity and calm, and of course, it is looking forward to the result," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the ICC hearing on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in Bolivia's favor that - after decades of irregular discussions - Chile is forced to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign landlocked land.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's indigenous charismatic president - who faces a controversial battle for a second term in next year's election - Monday's decision is quite important.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he pledged in late August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that it is very unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and that even if it did, little would change.
The Dutch-based UN body does not have the right to give another state part of the territory of Chile, and has said it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ is coming out with a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And instead of helping the Bolivian cause, the events of the last four years may have penalized it.
The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has wiped out every trace of kindness left in the Chileans, she suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was surprisingly quick.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end the 139-year-old, mutually beneficial disputes," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to understand that we must leave the past behind.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be carried out as long as it can't trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never carry out disarmament by nuclear weapons, as long as it can't trust Washington.
Ri was giving a speech on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reviving nuclear diplomacy so far, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, the hopes that continued U.S. sanctions and opposition to the Korean War declaration will make North Korea kneel are futile.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make significant disarmament moves, Washington hesitates to accept the statement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's intention to withdraw its arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant hats, which will soon come on the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your collection of hats or provide full protection from sunlight, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of bizarre giant hats for their SS19 collection on the runway, which left all the fashion designers on Paris Fashion Week by mouth.
The incredibly impractical hats have been taken to Instagram this summer, and these stylists have put their surprising creations on the runway.
Valentino's special creation was an extremely extravagant beige hat, adorned with a spacious shelter with feather-like details, which surrounded the model's head.
Other great accessories included stone-adorned watermelon, a magic hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of strange masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled the diving equipment, complemented by the air tube and water glasses, while another resembled a molten ice cream cone.
And if you like to follow this bold fashion - you're lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that the giant hats may soon come to the streets of your city.
The trend of giant hats has followed that of La Bomba, the straw hat with two wide legs, which we have seen all of them, ranging from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that hides behind the extremely impractical hat that took over social media, produced another great creation on the runway - a straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit model that was wearing it.
The bag of light-colored orange raffia with a white leather handle on top was the most special creation of the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquesquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer I expect to see giant hats and beach bags on the streets of cities - as the designer has left such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold the record for academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another row of excellent results in exams, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further higher education, for their chosen career and country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored education curriculum, we are witnessing how the branch of modern languages continues to be a widespread and popular choice across schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, your words go to his ears.
If you speak to him in his own language, your words go to his heart.
These words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships with people from foreign countries.
From the results of this year's final exams, we can find that languages are toping the list of results, with the highest rate of passing grades between private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages have received the maximum grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIs member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received the maximum grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying for German, 69 per cent of those studying for French and 63 per cent of those studying for Spanish had also received the grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, the branch of foreign languages is considered as important as STEM branches (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school curricula and beyond.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main difficulties employers faced for filling vacancies, 17 percent of them were related to a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for preparing young people for their future careers.
With the addition of jobs that have as a condition the possession of foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of a person's career, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as the owner of such a long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person over competitors.
According to a YouGov poll, which included over 4000 adults from the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only foreign language spoken by a percentage of people with 2 digits, namely 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Owning many languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered the most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a range of languages you can choose from in private schools, with pedagogical staff consisting of field specialists.
Private Scottish schools are committed to providing a school environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed to succeed, however the future.
In these times there can be no denying the fact that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills."
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
I'm going to let the faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron is set to make his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
There will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers' correspondent wrote on Twitter that, most likely, James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season program.
I don't need the games before the season at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump's rallies in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of electoral rallies this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five such rallies scheduled to be held next week, including stops in friendly areas involving Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the approval vote suspended for his election to fill the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump intends to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the November vote is held.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia today and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern time today evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia online below, via livestream on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will address this week's hearing at Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court, which was tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, with the Senate's expected confirmation vote remaining for a week as the FBI conducts investigations into the case.
But the primary goal of these numerous rallies is to help Republicans take a step forward in the run-up to the November election.
Trump's campaign staff said the five rallies next week were aimed at "energing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many countries as possible as he addresses the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who did not want to be identified.
Planned to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia's Metro News news agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, where he earned more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate Republican candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind, according to polls.
It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team showed willingness to fight while keeping their hopes alive by addressing singles competitions on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the remaining four for Sunday's afternoon could be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This swing of momentum is a completely created sporting concept, but a concept where players truly believe and never more than in such competitions.
Where can we say we feel this momentum now?
They had a six-point break that has now gone to four, so we can say that some kind of momentum has been created," said Jordan Spieth as he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage with four points ahead, when they remain in the game and 12 points.
As Spieth states, Americans hope the odds are in their favor and have a lot to encourage, in particular from the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three of the four points possible.
Spieth has been ruthless from the start of the shoot to the pit and is leading by giving his example.
The cheers of the party were added as the round continued, introducing the golf ball with an easy kick to take the match to the draw, when he and Thomas were previously two points down after two rounds.
His easy shot that gave them the win of the match in pit 15 was met with a similar cheer, which shows he believes the American team is still not out of the race.
You just have to work hard and worry about your game," he said.
All the players left now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple has scored four out of four and can't make a mistake.
Moliwood was the only couple not to catch a shot above the minimum on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shooting above the minimum on Sunday morning, Friday evening, and in the second nine shots on Friday morning.
This result and the way it seems that their energy flows to the enthusiastic crowd and vice versa reinforces the idea that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday and that there will be no other player better known than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun rises over the Le National Golf.
Probably both at the same time in different pits.
However, there are still early declarations of a European triumph.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four games, when he fell in love with Alex Noren.
One point above the minimum and two-doubles ahead put the Spaniard and the Swede in a pit from which they had no chance to get out anymore.
On Sunday, however, no one will be there to help you get out of your hole.
Four-and-a-half games are so amazing to follow closely due to the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the final, but these four sessions also showed that the U.S. team will still face off even though some people, particularly the Statesides, have questioned that.
Europe leads 10-6 as it heads towards the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has an essential advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of four games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspirational duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods to raise their four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, offered to take the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the helpless American team in the morning doubles, bringing it to 3-1 in the results series.
The American team showed more resistance in the fourth game, winning two games, but they couldn't reduce the difference.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed 'Mollwood', are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth game, they combined well enough to beat a helpless Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic score of 5&4.
Woods, who held two meetings on Saturday, displayed occasional outbursts of grandeur, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 games in the four-time game and with couples and seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, rested for the fourth game of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the couple's game and received a 2&1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't have everything in its favor on a pretty nice and fresh day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas decided the difference to be picked up by the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They took a bold 2&1 win over Spanish forward Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-games and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the pair matches after losing in the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned the result after a four-point difference in individual games, although Furyk's retaining team only needs a draw to hold the trophy.
However, after being the second best player for two days, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to go beyond their options.
North Korea says it will not be unilaterally disarmed without gaining confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the sanctions continued on Saturday were deepening mistrust of the United States and the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures that show goodwill" in the past year, such as banning nuclear and missile tests, dismantling areas where nuclear tests were conducted, and pledging not to add weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we are not seeing any response to this from the US," he said.
Without trust in the U.S., our national security will have no self-confidence, and under these circumstances there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be assessed due to the gradual steps it has taken, his statement seemed important because it did not exclude unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula" as Trump pledged guarantees regarding North Korea's security.
North Korea has demanded an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease strict international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists on conducting "nuclear disarmament" first and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a binding manner, even by opposing the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can put us to our knees is the dreams of people who are uninformed about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of the sanctions is deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the U.S. leader made earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party on the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the US, the process of nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have come to this situation without a way out."
Despite this, the tone used in the New Speech was deeply different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the deployment of U.S. territory targeted by North Korean missiles was inevitable as "Mr. President Devil" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking steps to disarm, but said there is still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions should continue to be active until North Korea conducts nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeline for that, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue strongly and unequivocally until the full and final verification of nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go so well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying there had been progress, and within hours North Korea denounced him for having carried out "mafia-style demands."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to disarm a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him the "relevant measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump pledged in Singapore and moving toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take lessons on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of study machoes through the use of caffeine by these 'sleepers'.
An academic observed that the world's number one university students often don't know when it comes to the most basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a reference to the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
At the end of it, a girl approached me and said, 'Why is this being said to me now, in my last year?'
She said no one had ever spoken to her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how they improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of medical services at the university, said the university decided to introduce this course after finding out that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a variety of interactive tasks.
On one side is a view of a dorm room, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to explain the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the hours to be spent in bed.
In another part, participants were explained how sleep deprivation in the long term increases the risks of heart attack, ischemic, depression, and cancer.
A map of the camp, with iconic icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - as you have the right to know, the health impact when choosing to smoke," Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in spending a 'sleepless night' continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was an ever-increasing problem.
Making sure you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads the brain to a mode of hunger, making them feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to turn it into a course for the whole camp.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all students of graduate studies to complete a similar study program before joining competing institutions.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students should set an hour's bell on when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of blue light coming out of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga scores against Gerrard's sons
Rangers took another hit as visitors as Dolly Menga's blow gave Steven Gerrard's disbanded side 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team from Ibrox were looking to record his first win since the February 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team lost the second in 18 games to Gerrard as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the fugitive Ladbroke Premiership chairman, Hearts team.
Menga scored seven minutes before the first half ended and with a set of Rangers team that seemed completely powerless to draw.
As Rangers now fall in sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and is directly behind Hibernian for goal difference.
Rangers could expect to have more trouble after their wing player Calum Spence was treated for a blow to the head after being hit by an object likely thrown by visiting fans.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which passed Air in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, introduced the same 11-year-old who grabbed a Hearts point last week and that he would feel satisfied with the way his well-organized team strangles opponents in every round.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston created more when he owned it.
They should have scored just two minutes from the start of the meeting, when the first pass that Mega gave Scott Pittman in the frame of the gate protected by Allan McGregor was not used correctly by him firing the ball outside.
A long cross from Keaghan Jacobs's penalty shootout found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, just threw him out at the back of the gate.
Rangers took control of the game but it seemed they were more hopeful than they really believed in their game in the opposing area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after a quarter-hour game as he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson did not listen to Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to perform two shots at the gate in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's strengthless shot.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was being seen on the pitch, no one can deny that they deserved it just for the quarrel they showed.
Again Rangers failed in the long-haul service for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who kept calm to cross Mega and score in a simple way.
Gerrard acted on the break between the parts while replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change almost gave no immediate effect as the winger followed for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his position to block him.
But Livingston continued to make guests play the way they want, where Lithgow and Halkett followed each other long balls from time to time.
Holt's team could extend his lead to the final stage, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow fired off a ball taken from the corner kick.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later claimed during the game for another penalty, while he was mistaken for Jacobs, but again Thomson allowed the advantage.
Almanaku: The inventor of the Geiger meter
And now a page from our almanac of "Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, How today 136 years ago and Next... the day that the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as the Geiger gauge.
A major pillar of science since then, Geiger became a staple of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado," with a cast of seemingly unprofessional scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter used to track radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that are released from radioactivity to minerals.
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening to it now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "distinguish" the bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory.
They can detect a protein that is commonly found in many types of cancer and then reintroduced.
A vaccine being tested is showing promising results in patients who have several types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells noticed that ovarian cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can 'distinguish' a protein commonly found in some types of cancer called HER2, and then reintroducing these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results tell us that we are dealing with an incredibly promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from patients "to teach" them how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West appeared at a Pro-Trump rally, wearing a hat with the Maga inscription, after his SNL show.
It didn't go as it should.
Kanye West was whistled at studio protests during a broadcast on Saturday Night Live, following a disappointing performance where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night called "Ghost Town," where he was wearing a hat that read "Make America Great," he continued to speak out with strong tones against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
How many times do I talk to a white person and they say to me, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL launched the show with a parody starring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star played Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual harassment charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's harsh speech recordings were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with that post or not.
West also complained to viewers that he had been having a hard time behind him because of what he had put on his head.
They mistreated me in the background.
I was told, 'Don't go on stage with that hat on your head.'
They mistreated me!
And then they tell me I'm sinking," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the drowned?", saying, "I put my superhuman hat on my head because it shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try the love."
His comments received whistles at least twice from spectators and SNL cast members appeared to feel ashamed, Variety reports, where one person told the newspaper: "The whole studio fell silent."
West had been called up as a late deputy instead of Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the rendition of the song "I Love It," dressed as a perrier bottle.
West was supported by the chairman of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest souls: Thank you for staying at the forefront of the crowd."
But TV host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just himself and that's incredible."
But I choose not to reward someone (buying music or clothing or supporting his art), for whom I believe to be ashamed and to spread ideologies that are harmful to my community.
While he is free.
That's how we are," she added.
Before the show, the singer said on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was already "the being formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper friend Snoop Dogg has been nicknamed Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted knife murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hits toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a swordsman in the character Jon Snow, in the violent series of the medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones."
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the stereotype of the male hero, saying the appearance of such roles on the screen makes young boys perceive that they should behave as strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong" and was asked how the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era could be solved.
Kit, who recently married his acting colleague in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "fairly important" in resolving the matter.
I personally feel very important at the moment - where did we go wrong with the appearance of masculinity?" he said.
What have we taught men as they grow up, about the problems we are facing now?
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the excessive male characters appearing there.
He continued: "What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, which makes young men believe that they should behave in a certain way to feel men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong with the young guys.
During the interview he also admitted that he would no longer shoot for "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of next summer, saying that "the battlefields and the horses have come to the top of his nose."
From November, Kit will take part in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he got from Game of Thrones.
In this production I found my wife, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and defined my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the award-winning science fiction series Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected across the country, health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, displaying a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people receiving HIV through this method had almost gone to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said to still dominate discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have measured that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease occurs due to inadequate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical drugs for the treatment of HIV as part of the crackdown effort.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP Senators' records have been spread by staff members, says these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that these claims were being pushed by "extreme right-wing" experts and websites.
Lies, lies and just disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after all three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the publications were linked to the Waters office and leaked data of a Waters staff member.
This baseless claim is totally untrue and a big lie," Waters continued.
The member of my staff - the identity, personal information and security of which has been compromised as a result of these false and fabricated claims - has in no way been responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statement was immediately met with online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This denial becomes frustrated," Fleischer wrote.
That means she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't be nervous.
He shouldn't be a provocateur.
It should not question the motives of the accuser.
He has to be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to take over Waters in mid-term elections, also posted his statements on Twitter.
Great case, if it will be true," he wrote on Twitter.
Waters said in a statement that its office had signalled "the relevant authorities and law enforcement institutions on these false allegations."
We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have a devastating and dangerous effect on every one of my staff.
Johnny English hit again" - comedy with the spy unacquired with Rowan Atkinson material
It has become the case in every new British-influenced film to be seen for hidden messages on the topic of Brexit, and this finds implementation and re-emergence on the stage of the Johnny English action comedy-action venture - which starts in 2003 with "Johnny English" and returns in 2011 with "Johnny English's Return."
Will this satirical comedy reveal how clearly incompetent we are to be linked to new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, the face-to-face character of Johnny English has received the authorization to confuse things for the second time - his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a comical creature made up for territories where English is not spoken but frequenting cinema.
Of course he is a flawed secret agent, who despite surprisingly claiming to appear as enchanting, there is little from the inspector Clouseau, little from Mr Bean's character and a portion of that type that contributed only to the release of a sound in the song 'Chariots of Fire', at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
He is also based on the man of the mysteries, traveler and international Atkinson, who once starred in television commercials that have now been forgotten by Barclaycard, leaving the country in chaos wherever it went.
There are one or two good moments at the premiere of this film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval harness and the propeller's sheet crashed slightly into his helmet.
This is where the gift of physical comedy that Atkinson performs appears to be lukewarm and sometimes excessive, especially when films like 007 and Mission Impossible have even introduced a little more comedy as an ingredient in their films.
Humor seems to be directed at children more than adults and Johnny English's crazy events are not so creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as those that Atkinson performs in Bean's character.
The permanent theme, as well as in this film, is the fact that the UK is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super-secret network of agents, revealing the identity of British ground agents, and has let down the acting agent - unfortunately a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister who appears as a pompous figure and ready for battle, who is already suffering an extraordinary political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best to realize the character that resembles Teresa May, but there is not much text in the script that can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who has retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English himself, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-class neighborhood, but who informally taught how to become a secret agent: here are beautiful scenes, because English is offering a rock school-shaped spy academy.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his former aide, the long-suffering Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to a submarine captain, in the role of a top-tier girl, where Vicki Pepperdine is used a bit wrong for this role.
So Batman and Robin of doing things completely backwards in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, battling the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being enchanted by the attractive tech billionaire who claims he can solve the difficulties of British computers: evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their funny and entertaining odyssey: disguised as waiters, set a beautiful French restaurant on fire; cause chaos as they enter Volta's luxury yacht; and English is literally trying to use Virtual Reality equipment to get acquainted with the interiors of Volta's house.
All sequences are normally made for the final scene, but despite being fun and loud, the whole thing looks a bit like a children's movie.
Very moderate things.
Even as in other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: isn't the British film industry a role for Rowan Atkinson that would fit his talent?
The Labour Party denies it has a plan for the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week - but pay for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's chiefs to save by using artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for employees, giving them an extra day off.
We would see that employees would enjoy a weekend with three days off - but continuing to take home the same salary.
Sources said the idea would "consistent" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in favor of employees.
Moving to a four-day working week is an idea that has been embraced by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "Before the end of the year a policy review is expected to be announced.
It won't happen immediately, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that aligns with the party's approach to balancing the economy in favor of employees as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace the idea, where the Green Party has previously pledged a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not being supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not party politics and it is not being taken into account by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to convey his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to switch power from "anonymous directors" and "beneficiaries" to public service firms.
The chancellor's shadow plans also imply that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all of their shares, because the Labour government may carry out "debates" on the grounds of actions considered a violation.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create Comprehensive Property Funds to pass employees 10 percent of private sector firms' equity, meaning a dividend paid per year in value of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy at 60 Minutes, if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises questions about whether the FBI's findings could affect any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
I said that when I was entering the hearing, I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, so after the allegations came out and I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was clear and clear."
However, Graham's vote looks like it's carved into stone.
I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make a bomb charge," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And anyone she mentioned couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music show featuring a huge and impressive list of stars who perform and also have an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host crowds of thousands at the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the interpretations of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real purpose of the show, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket for the show (except when you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill a range of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the "Global Citizen" festival when there were 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince them to seek these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known as "click activism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" has reportedly recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, giving a boost to various goals.
It is said that these actions have helped encourage world leaders to declare $37 billion worth of commitments and policies, which are said to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and statements as a result of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion has already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have made a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of UK-based investors and implementing agencies committed to "help children grow to their full potential," promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from activists from Global Citizen.
With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can transform the social injustice of malnutrition into a memory of the past," the ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition" told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking 5000 actions to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, that will affect 5 million women and children in need of food interventions.
In an answer to the most frequently asked questions on their website, they asked, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like any high civil right and the anti-apartheid movement in front of us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the actors who will perform at this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy for "blockage" to deter Russian energy exports - The Home Secretary
If necessary, Washington could rely on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to this official, there are ways to address this problem.
The United States has the capability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them so as to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit organization that has personified itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that these approaches are practically the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fossil fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a rogue swarm" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as the Trump administration has undertaken a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow captive.
Moscow has repeatedly said the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which it claims will double the existing pipeline's capacity to take to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the same opinion that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a lot of trouble when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously" consider whether to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously" consider taking part in the presidential race after mid-term elections.
During a rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our destroyed government, and that includes putting a woman on top," she said.
After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren hit President Donald Trump during a rally in the city, saying he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction."
I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, before the vote we need an FBI investigation."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large portion of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported this nomination.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support to run, with 38 per cent supporting a possible run for him and 48 per cent opposing the nomination.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed to run in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being summoned to the military in September.
On Monday evening he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
What my son is going through, what he's going through after he's back, I can connect him to other families who feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers come back with," she told the participants at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an "elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "come a little bit changed, hardened, thinking about whether they get the right respect from soldiers and other members of the military for what they have given the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence following an attack on a woman, following a report of domestic violence and possession while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal opposition to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who have escaped criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed an explanatory document as friends-to-judge in Washington on Friday in support of the change in asylum-seeking policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace case against Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal politics has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was stopped in Texas.
State lawyers who are supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a high number of asylum applicants in the US because they are countries that have widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum-seeking policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Migrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
Colombia's District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignors decades of state, federal and international law."
Federal laws require that all asylum applications must be judged according to specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure conflicts with this principle," the court's friend-to-court report said.
Lawyers argued in the report that the ban that police made on the entry of immigrants hurt the U.S. economy, saying their chances are to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary arm of work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or ethnicity in a particular social group or political persuasion," Sessions said on June 11.
Asylum is never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death balance doubles in a race to find survivors
In the survivors, the situation was very honorable.
The situation feels quite tense," 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said while carrying her young and ill son to an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
The ambulance brings the bodies every minute.
There is no more clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, bringing their items submerged in water, in an attempt to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake are overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his back and shoulder, were placed at the Military Hospital outside Palu, where patients are being treated in outdoor settings because the earth's shocks are still ongoing.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled the violent earthquake shock in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was crushed under the rubble of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
I heard that the woman was crying and asking for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'harassment' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad on a U.S. daily promoting the common benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement to Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in U.S. congressional elections held on November 6, a charge denied by China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to add pressure to China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war which has seen tariffs on each other's imports equate.
Chinese and U.S. experts have said China's retaliatory tariffs in this trade war were set to hit exporters in countries like Iowa, which has backed Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor for a long time in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote, "China is already doubling down on this bullying by placing propaganda ads in our free press."
By distributing its propaganda, China's government is being helped by the commendable American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
In contrast to this, in newspaper kiosks on the streets here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against it, and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China avoided the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of the midterm elections following the Kavanaugh scandal
The more Republican main characters stand up and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, ahead of several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned they will face a backlash especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions on this subject have been very high, and many Republicans have publicly stated that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things cannot be undone," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute bid for an investigation by the FBI and that it will be enough to appease angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted 'November is coming!' while demonstrating in the Senate corridors as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite evidence from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Enthusiasm and democratic motivation will reach the top," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People are saying it's already at a high level; that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided women voters in the suburbs and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, even though they don't like the president, usually don't vote at all.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there would be a backlash if Republicans continued to support the nomination.
This has become a complicated mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed in the defendant's bank, it's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they have treated that woman," Guy Cecil, director of priorities, told NBC News.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to trust on the eve of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the latter having a slightly higher backing.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they doubt it or most likely Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent think Kavanaugh probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating claims filed by Ford and other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted him at the age of 17 while in a drunken state.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court displayed his genitals in front of her while they were at a party while they were studying at Yale, the 80s.
World Wide Web creator plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the Worldwide Network, is setting up a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lee's open-source platform, called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind Inrupt is "world domination."
We have to do it now," he said of the company.
It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create "the storage of their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of things to do, music lists and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having it available in a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique about storing personal data on the network is the fact that it is entirely up to the user what kind of information he will access.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to bring together the right resources, processes, and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on this project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google whether or not they should introduce a total change where all their business models are completely overturned at night.
We are not asking for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-built network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the Worldwide Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the network's impartiality debate.
While founding Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Network Consortium, the Network Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I'm extremely optimistic about this new era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann celebrates the award of the Victoria Cross during the First World War to the clergyman
The only cleric to have won a Victorian Cross during World War I in the capacity of a warrior has been commemorated in his native country 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" for the memorial to be displayed exactly 100 years after the heroic act that awarded the medal to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin canal "through a thick fog and under the hail of bullets from fields and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a "great bravery" led the battalion forward and grabbed one of the weapons on the battlefield and killed only three people from opposing troops.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid out a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said he "felt quite honored to be part of this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is being displayed by the support given to him by many."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead saw "Dercrucen Pepa."
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206, and then you got the chance to watch this main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six fights in the base package and would be shown in real-time on Channel 5, in the UK.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the broadcast changed to show the Pepa Pig.
Some remained unhappy after being up all night until the early hours, especially for this match.
A fan on Twitter described the transition from the game to a children's cartoon film as "an ugly joke."
It is the government's rules that determine that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate and we had to switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
The "pipe pig," yes.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they will work on the program to include viewers from Britain in the future.
When I think about re-broadcasting, I think we can solve it," Cocker said.
But there is six o'clock in the morning, Sunday and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our clock, that is, Monday with their clock.
But we're working on that.
Trust me, when the program was changed there were a lot of messages circulating and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to play five games instead of six - as we usually do - we tried to give more to the fans and maybe we've exceeded the target.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he did not understand until he went to nine-year-old school that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, introduced by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised the voice for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning an Olympic medal.
The presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because she is ill.
Appearing as a sidelined person in Laverne's first program, Daley said that while growing up he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt differently, have been the real elements that gave me the impetus and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was worth "something," he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexual orientation.
Twice awarded the bronze Olympic medal, he is already a high-profile LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "captured me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference has never been a problem.
When he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all prospects" had changed.
If you had asked me last year, all I thought was, 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
You know what, there are things more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was whether we had ready tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't say, 'You can't be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and passed away I accepted for the first time that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
I knew that this was what I had dreamed about all my life - to dive in front of the local audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first musical selection - Proud by Heather Small - that has accompanied him during preparations for the Olympics and continues to cause the mornica.
Desert Island Discs is available on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, with British time.
Mickelson, out of shape, was left on the bench on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but will have to change his form to avoid turning this historic moment into a disappointment.
Mickelson, for whom it is the 12th time to participate in the event, a separate record, which is organized every two years, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Fury, during the double games (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as usual for the United States, the five-time winner of the big titles spent the day supporting the team and working with the hope that it will leave the worries behind.
Not among the players with the fairest kick even when he was at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complicated field of Le Golf National, where long and difficult areas leave no room for wrong shots.
And as if only the fear of the pitch wasn't enough, Mickelson on Sunday will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with starter Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who have four fewer points before the start of their 12 singles matches, start the game fast, Michaelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, although he can't say more than that.
He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap in the shoulder, threw my hand at my neck and told me he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and he has made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he would play two games.
I had thought more, but in the end it turned out that way and we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be on the field, like everybody else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the player with the most appearances in Ryder Cup matches.
He could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, likes to bully people, and he's a fantastic guy to have in the team room," he explained.
Also, I think the younger players were having fun facing him this week, and it was nice to see.
He gives more than just a game."
Europe's captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big lead could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, knows from experience that the considerable lead ahead of the final day of singles games at the Ryder Cup can turn into an unpleasant factor.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 fight at Valderrama, where the team captained the five-point lead against the Americans ended the tournament by winning by a narrow margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
I remind myself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with a lot of difficulty," Bjorn said, who was photographed as he saw a 5-3 win in Class 2018 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the story tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we're going to the last race.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's over until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win this trophy and here is our focus.
I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we face - the best players in the world.
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush to this stage.
Tomorrow we will face another 'monster'.
Tomorrow shows individual performances, and that's something else that needs to be done.
It's great when you're on the pitch with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you get tested in your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner because he has to go and give his best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Fury will hope that his players perform better individually than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, taking three out of four possible points.
Fury himself has experienced both cases of big returns on the last day, being part of the Brooklyn winning team before losing to what is considered the "miracle in Medinah" of the European team.
I remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players during the last day, Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we have to have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When you get the flow in one arm, you put a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set the lineup based on this and we're going to bring the guys to the top we believe in, as you know, we're trying to achieve a miracle tomorrow.
Thomas has the task of starting to overturn the result and will face Rory McIlroy in the lead match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players positioned in the first half of the standings.
I chose this group and in this ranking I believe it covers the whole game," Bjorn said of his singles selections.
The production of the new German warship is postponed again.
The new German navy frigate should have been sent in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but it won't be ready until at least next year due to problematic systems and fairly high costs, local media reported.
The delivery of Rhineland-Palatinate, the main frigate ship Baden-Wuerttemberg-class, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after sending damage to the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, which were commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will serve as replacements for the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is known to contain a powerful ball, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and anti-intelligence (stealth) technology, such as reducing radar detection, infrared and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for new frigates to be moved for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the latest technology warships - which are said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad - will be obsolete at the time they enter service.
The "unfortunate" F125 frigate came out on the front pages last year, when the German navy formally rejected the order for the ship and turned it into the seayard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to its builder after delivery.
Little was given about the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany cited a series of "major flaws in software and hardware" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The problems in programming were particularly important in the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships because they will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - half the workforce of old Bremen class frigates.
It was also discovered that the ship was extremely overweight, which reduced its yield and limited the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice the weight of ships of the similar category used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical parts with problems, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also turning into a problem.
It is said to have reached a figure that leaves you speechless at €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - out of the €2.2 billion originally projected.
The problems that have gripped the new frigates become particularly important after recent warnings that the German navy's power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee in the German parliament, admitted that the Navy is "doing the appropriate ships to move to another country."
The official said the issue had been compounded over time because the old ships had been pulled out of use but were not replaced with new ones.
He said regretfully that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg-class's new frigates could join the navy.
National Trust observes the secret life of bats
A new research being conducted by a company in Scotland's mountainous areas aims to find out how bats use the ground to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help defensive activities in the future.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow ordinary night bats and those called soprano pipistrelles as well as brown-ears and Daubenton bats in Inverewe gardens, in West Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
The sound analysis to be carried out by experts for all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and what each species does.
Then, a report and a map of their habitat will be drawn up to give a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature protection adviser for NTS, hopes the findings will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information would help determine the benefits of settlement administration, such as the creation of pastures and how to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are under the threat of construction and development works that have an impact on nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as do adhesive paper or chemical components of building materials, as well as domestic animal attacks.
In fact, the bats are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated location-finding technique through sounds to accurately determine insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes the bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, nest inspections and sometimes engage in rescue programs.
The organization has even raised the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to bats in Threave, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The administrator of this reserve, David Thompson, says that this country is the ideal territory for them.
Here in Threave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all the right habitat.
But there are still a lot of things about bats that remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to develop."
He emphasizes the importance of carrying out the screenings for bats before carrying out the property maintenance works because there is a possibility that the unintentional destruction of a nest can kill up to 400 female and young bats, thus wiping out the entire population of an area.
Night nudes are protected and killing, harassing and disturbing them or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish clerk at the Nightkeeping Trust, encourages people to become part of the help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we just don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the rape allegations against him were "fake news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he then allegedly paid her $375 000 not to talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram, directed at 142 million of his followers, just hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, considered the reports to be "fake news."
No, no, no, no.
What was said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in front of the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called "unacceptable reports of suspicions about private life."
Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in value corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009, at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at Clark County Court in Nevada after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said "99 percent" he is a "good guy" left in the mud by "one percent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple has had sex but that it was with both sides' consent.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and that she had photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a solution outside the court because she was "horrified of revenge" and was worried she would be "publicly ashamed."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to return the deal because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giants of Juventus in a €100m deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' loss of car manufacturer status
The UK will "regret forever" if it loses world leader status in post-Brexit car manufacturing, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, society would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby.
We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays, in the event of no-deal exit, would cost jobs lost.
The Burnaston factory - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
In my judgment, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fears of a no-deal exit and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit it would shut down its Mini series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as supply chain risks in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on "immediately once ordered" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU, for custom cars.
If, on March 29, the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, there may be delays at the border which according to this industry could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory of its plant in Derbyshire for more than a day, the company said, and as a result production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU "was built specifically to avoid these border controls."
We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment for also taking advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The data, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, show that we must definitely be able to continue what has been a fairly successful supply chain.
Toyota could not determine how long production would stop, but in the long run, it warned that the added costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and consequently lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and who is a senior unit official at the factory, said members are increasingly worried: "According to my experience when these jobs close, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have set a precise and credible plan for our relationship with the EU for the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the fight continues for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election meddling, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and the possibility that the president has obstructed justice.
Whether or not Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general from office, putting Mueller's independence at risk is something that has created rumors for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein considered setting up a whistleblower to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of firing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was close to resigning.
Contrary to what was expected, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer" not to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further pushing the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set yet, it could be this week. I think it could be postponed another week given everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The moderator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not come as a result of dissatisfaction with the attitude of television journalists," although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they attract attention.
Later, she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president performs more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without citing data: "We have seen these figures.
There will continue to be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then that's much better than talking to me."
We try to do this often and you've seen that we've done it often over the past few weeks, replacing press conferences when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions, or at press conferences with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president probably showed the reason for this, this week, in New York, where he made a controversial and in some strange cases, appearance to reporters.
The Secretary of Health writes to employees from the EU, at the NHS Scotland, about the fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to staff from the EU working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to stay even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish MP, has sent a letter, less than six months after the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations for the UK's departure from the EU have continued, approaching a decision in the fall.
But the UK government has also intensified its preparations in the case of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
For this reason, I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, increasing the benefits of patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers centre-back Christion Abercrombie underwent immediate surgery after suffering head injury on Saturday, in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, The Tennessee Journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the first half.
He came to the sideline and fell there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline before putting it on the stretcher and sending it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed the surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/degree of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He performed five interventions on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing the total number of interventions during the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will pay higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay higher stamp tax for buying a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help the homeless under the Conservative Party's new plans (Tory)
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters
The stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that buyers with foreign nationality will pay higher stamp tax for buying a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters with promises to offer more affordable housing and to "target high-earnings people."
The stamp tax will apply to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, while additional money will support the government's initiative to combat housing shortages.
This extra fee - which is added to the current stamp tax, including the increase in the tax rate introduced two years ago for second houses and for properties purchased for rent - can go up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts that the move will raise up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of recently built properties in London are bought by people residing outside the UK, which makes it harder to find housing from buyers for the first time.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign nationals who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of holding high prices by buying land but not putting it into use, and called on Mrs May to give up quotas for affordable homes in order to fix Britain's "disgrace with properties."
Mr Corbyn has proposed some attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the removal of "no reason" departures.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I declared that I would dedicate the mandate of the Prime Minister to the return of the British dream - that is, to a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign societies find it easier to buy homes than British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become something incredibly difficult to achieve, and injustice to the homeless is more than real.
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
Scotland, 42, are enjoying the challenge of re-establishing the north-eastern club, which is currently in third place in League One (third category), three points away from the head.
He came this summer to the Stadium of Light after returning to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I once appeared in representative B and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
But as a child I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will only come if I am successful in the direction of the clubs.
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he is not worried about following in the footsteps of these big names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my success will depend on whether I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly has its place in the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get there, but I would only see myself as successful if I managed to bring the club back to the Premier League.
Ross has only started his career as a coach after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint at Hearts management staff.
He then helped Alloa climb a category up to the third round of the cup, and transformed St. Mirren from a club near the decline from the category to the Championship title winners next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he has ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Maybe it was really a turning point," he says, for taking the lead of Alloa.
I really believed training was the right thing for me, rather than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, I lived a good life thanks to this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
Being a player can be difficult.
You have to experience a lot of things every week.
Again, I experience a lot of stress and pressure from work, but training seems the right job.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like that. I've never been so good and so myself throughout my life as an adult.

According to a study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has boosted local income in the UK, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Data shows sales in groups of bars and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but purchases in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who compiled the data, said: "The ongoing sunny weather as well as England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected led to July following the same trend as June, where local sales increased by 2.8 percent, while restaurants recorded even higher declines.
The turnover in restaurants fell by 1.8% in June, and further deteriorated in July.
Bars and bars with main activity recorded the best performance, with higher growth than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
Locals with main food delivery activity also recognized the decline as a result of sunny weather, although not as significant as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
Sales of drinks at bars and bars increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hospitality at the RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the non-home market, the weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain key factors.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to encounter difficulties, although a decline in sales by 4.8 percent per year will have a particularly heavy burden considering constant cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators, and time will tell if the most average temperatures of August will give the much-needed calm.
The total increase in sales in local and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting reflected in the launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach Index of industry sales tracking, for the UK's bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with a total turnover of more than 9 billion GBP, and is the industry's benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to one study, one in five children - some of whom are not more than 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that hide it from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20 000 students of nine-year education showed an increase in "fake Insta" profiles.
This news has increased the fear of sexual content posts.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account that their parents tell them.
One in five children - some of whom are not more than 11 years old - are opening social media accounts, which use adult secrecy.
A survey of 20 000 students of nine-year-old education showed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" profiles - linked to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of sexual content posts.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean "main" account that their parents tell them, but they also have private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally revealed her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, found that a teenager urged others to "rap her."
The study of Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors ("Headmasters and Headmistresses" Conference - HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18 age group had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on Scotland's athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected on the Board of Athletics in Scotland, to the post of non-executive director of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh enjoys massive respect in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely by making it part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to serve as the voice of the athletes and I hope I will contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and who is a regular expert at the BBC, lost the ability to walk after a temporary ischemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if it will heal and to what extent.
It took a exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, learned to walk again and today I'm doing training!
Thank you for encouraging messages!"
The breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows shares public opinion
A society for the production of breast pumps has shared public opinion with an ad that compares mothers breastfeeding with cow milking.
To launch the promotion of what is considered the world's "world's first silent and wearable breast pump," consumer technology products company, Elvie, displayed a fun music video to promote the freedom this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four real mothers dance in a bar-filled cow stable under the sound of a song with lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't notice, these aren't breasts, it's my breasts."
The refrain goes on: "Pomp, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk the ladies."
However, the ad, which was published on the firm's Facebook page, has sparked online debate.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it undercuts the "horrificness" of the dairy industry.
Using cows to advertise this product is a very poor decision.
Just like us, they should get "pregnant" and "bring" to produce milk, just because their "baby" are taken from them a few days after they are born," one wrote.
Elvie's breast pump is placed inside the bra and does not fall into the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Certainly traumatic for the mother and the child.
Why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can carry their babies?
Someone else added, "What an advertising without empathy."
Others supported the ad, among which a woman admitted that the song appeared "to be funny."
I think that's a genius idea.
I would have bought one if you were still breastfeeding the baby.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I saw what it means.
This is a genius product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad directed at mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and who feel like a cow.
This is not an advertisement that evaluates or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group shows that they have all danced with the "hidden" pump placed on the choppers.
The concept behind this campaign is based on data that many women who use a breast pump say they feel like a cow.
However, the Elvie pump is noise-free, has no threads or tubes, is placed inside the chipsets and does not fall into the eye, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even go out while using it.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD (Creative Executive Director) in Mother commented: "The Elvis pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and dairy cows, we wanted to point out the use of the breast pump and the challenges encountered, also displaying in a fun and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the new pumps give.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has come out on the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly displaced in a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively the same, in part as the rhetoric and strict policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to send children to their supporters.
Usually, most supporters have been themselves undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to risk their stay in the country trying to apply for a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give their fingerprints, and that data would also be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs agency official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
About 80 percent of individuals who are supporters or family members of supporters stay in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedents.
So, we are continuing to follow these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to housing workers, trying to process children's data faster, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the ban, not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear before the immigration judge via video conferencing rather than physically, to argue their request for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to housing workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children stay banned, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more severe in larger settings such as Tornillo, where, due to their size, they are more likely to overlook signs that a child has difficulties.
They add that moving children to your city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many of them already face.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualm also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has already entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces remain on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would "act with them in the right way."
They should immediately and unconditionally withdraw," he said during the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign forces."
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions are good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that push the refugees away.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
They are politicizing an issue that should be completely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned they will not provide assistance to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created opportunities to move forward with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear instructions" and expressed confidence that military strikes would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be exterminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid out the conditions for the government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution," and warned there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Under this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many people with liberal views hope, the accusations and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency in history!"
So far, there are no signs of eye strain.
As of 2014, the number of viewers during peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during peak hour, up from 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top of the charts with 3.5 million viewers over the evenings with major events.
This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of ABC's "Designed Survivor," which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride to Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He replied, "Because it makes me laugh," Ms Scovell said.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disregard is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, if you find yourself after six hours watching a panel of experts debating the use of "unacknowledged information" by Bob Woodward in his book Fear, Paul Manafort's 15 000 USD leather bomber jacket (a dress filled with arrogance," The Washington Post) as well as the implications of Stormy Daniels' vivid descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy, then that goes beyond being an informed citizen.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
Part of what he does and makes it look like a reality show is that it feeds you on something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the actors circulating and the unexpected day-to-day developments of Trump's program (debates with N.F.L., praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can't leave an episode without seeing it otherwise you're left behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the weather was sunny and the outside temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was hiding inside, watching MSNBC, while recording CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on the edge.
I remember when we realized all those crazy programs in the past and the people who said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.

Money from outside the private sector flows into the narrow race for the congressional elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a cash flow as a result of the reorganization of the constituencies forcing two incumbent officials to run for the same post.
This recent reorganization in the suburbs of Pittsburgh has placed Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won the post in another area, in the special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th-old zone, which has been superimposed on the new 17th.
This new map sharing came after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling, which in January said the old areas had been unconstitutionally and unfairly designated in favor of Republicans.
This competition, in the new area 17, has also sparked a strong confrontation in funding campaigns from major party funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congressional Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election, for Pennsylvania's 18th constituency.
For more than a decade, that post was held by Republicans, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Political experts see Democrats as easy favorites.
The U.S. considers penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little push from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to remove the U.S. chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decisions not to recognize Taiwan," the department's spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador who received an aid of about $140 million from America in 2017, including drug control, development and support for the economy.
Proposed penalties that included reductions in financial aid and certain restrictions on visa issuance would be severe for the Central American country and its high levels of unemployment and killings.
As domestic meetings made progress, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to attend a similar meeting last year, a move that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear they wanted the conference to take place, ending any possibility of imposing penalties on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence plans to deliver a speech at the conference, which was scheduled for mid-October, a signal indicating the administration's importance to the meeting, diplomats said.
And all three U.S. envoys returned peacefully from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or condemnation from Washington.
A White House official for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, provided they maintained their anonymity.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst with the administration, who also spoke, demanding the right to anonymity.
Study history.
The next event that is expected to take place could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on potential obstruction by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public records.
Mueller is reportedly moving his investigation to establish whether, during his campaign, Trump has cooperated with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes its side, Mr. Trump will have to account for the body, at a time when he is preparing to appear before voters again, and possibly eventually face an independent jury.
That's a lot if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall - or that of his counterparts in Europe - is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, have to make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which accelerate or delay the inevitable path of democracy.
At present, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly wiretapping the president, as well as speculating that he is not fit to stay in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times article is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the next election for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If these tests fail, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the residence of the ambassadors I resided in.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table bearing the symbol of swastika (the broken cross).
Having this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of a clash with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers expect Rapid Vienna knowing that a win against the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal, earlier this month, would place them in a favourable position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make his first appearance this season in a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a boost to achieve bigger things.
It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
We went into the field believing we could get something and came up with a point.
Maybe we could have scored in the end, but overall, I think the draw was a fair result.
Maybe they were better in the first half and we showed up in the second half and we were the better team.
On Thursday, it will be another big European evening.
I hope we can get three points but it will be a difficult match because they achieved a positive result in their last game, but, with the fans supporting us, I am sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to injuries and changes in the club but now there is an optimistic factor in this team.
The team is fine and the boys are enjoying it a lot; the training goes well.
I hope we can move forward, throw the season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that participants in the study had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to take care of them, very few people spoke to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they spoke to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, the company's vice president of life insurance, Nationwide.
Here's where we have to start.
Talk to your husband and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't show your wishes first.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how to take care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial advisor as well: The advisor can help you find a way to pay the expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term insurance policy, hybrid life insurance policies with savings to help cover these expenses or self-insurance through your property - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorization.
Get a health care attorney and appoint a trusted person who will oversee your health care and guarantee that experts act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider getting a proxy for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and guarantee payment of bills if you can't do it yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and the medications you take?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you are ready.
It's not just the financial aspect, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What medications will be used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he went home after spending the evening outside.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers said it was a "random act" which took place around 02:30 BST.
The victim did not see the aggressor.
The injuries received are not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials have said, as the death toll is expected to rise.
With out-of-function communication networks, aid workers have failed to get information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu, which was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16 000 people have been evacuated following the disaster.
Below are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of nearly 379 800, in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donggala is a regency extending to more than 300 km (180 miles) long coastline northwest of Sulawesi island.
Regency, an administrative region smaller than the province, had an estimated population of about 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and livestock are the main economic activities of the province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi's coast.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, causing 226 000 casualties along the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half lived in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on the island of Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed the lives of about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, bringing destruction and panic to people after it was recalled by the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time, there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people lost their lives from the collapse of buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police, Paul, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a domestic violence suspect, for obstructing domestic violence reporting, and for opposing arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman, his acquaintance, tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up the phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su detention facility and is being held in the form of $500 uninsured bonds, KTUU reported.
According to reports from the network, he appeared in court on Saturday and when asked about his guilty plea, he said he was "absolutely innocent."
Palin faces three category A violations, meaning she could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250 000.
He has also been charged with a category B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Paul.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being investigated by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting, and drunken possession during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD as a result of serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died on Friday after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of service and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos on social media show the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the New York City terror suspect who killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the terrorist attack on a bicycle road along the western highway, in lower Manhattan, violating pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has "premeditatedly" killed all eight victims and that he has caused serious bodily harm "premeditated," according to a letter aimed at seeking the death penalty, filed in New York's southern district.
According to a court document, both of these charges could be punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury put Saipov in the face of 22 lawsuits, including eight counts of murder in aid of organized crime, charges often used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack came as a result of "significant and premeditated planning," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution of the crime as "disgusting, cruel and moralless."
Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagunco," the letter reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time New York's southern district prosecuted a death sentence case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring and spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbek nationality, did not show remorse during the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos of ISIS on his mobile phone.
Police said he had also sought to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public lawyers, said they were "very disappointed with the prosecution's decision."
We think that the decision to seek the death penalty and not accept the guilt associated with life imprisonment without appeal will further increase the trauma caused by these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP says Nigel Farage should be placed at the helm of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised during a protest at the Conservatives' conference that he would "mobilize the people's army."
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of eurosceptics - after one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would be 'out' if Brexit secretary were Mr Farage.
But the challenge Mrs May faces to unite her group has been highlighted by pro-EU conservatives who joined another protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is facing difficulties in implementing the compromise plan reached at Chequers, amid attacks coming from those who want to stay or leave the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
Allies insist she will try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite fierce reactions - and will force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
During the Departure march, Mr. Bone stated that he wants to abandon the Chequers agreement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be put in charge and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he were at the top, we would now be out," he said.
Wellingborough's deputy added: "I will support Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers deal."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote, it is not supported even within our party and by activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs in cases where they keep their promises."
Farage said during the march that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are considering abandoning the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
Now, this is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say, 'We're not going to let you do that.'
During a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to force our political class, which is close to abandoning Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and government itself.
Meanwhile, those in favor of staying marched to Birmingham, before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small group of activists held banners depicting Conservatives against Brexit following the group's weekend show.
Labour supporter Lord Adonis railed with conservatives over the security problems they had with a "social app" during the launch of the conference.
These are the people who tell us they can prepare the IT systems and the technology needed for "Canada plus" for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
It's totally a farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to "carefully review" the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "carefully consider the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about her future during a meeting in the city hall on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the municipal format since Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for "women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top."
A man has been arrested for the murder of the LSU team player, Wayde Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the murder of basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at around 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department said in a news conference.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the person who appeared there.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the South University campus on Friday morning.
The "Wayde Sims passed away as a result of gunshot wounds to the head," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, carrying guns, and having shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to police custody in the eastern Baton Rouge area.
The Sims, 6′′′, played 32 games, of which 10 as a starter, last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team instructions give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas left first place and almost "punished" Hamilton after defending his position on the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and let Hamilton compete in "traffic" at the end of the car pile, something that should have turned out to be decisive.
Mercedes made the stop a lap later and positioned behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out on top after several maneuvers that forced Ferrari's pilot to leave space from within after a double move to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last line and at the end of the first lap was ranked seventh, on his 21st birthday.
Then he was at the top in a large part of the race as he didn't change tires to reach a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen ranking fourth.
Eventually, he stopped on the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace on the remaining eight laps, leaving Raikkonen fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was shown a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these exchanges of positions," Hamilton said.
Very poor use of body language
President Donald Trump railed against Senator Dianne Feinstein during a rally on Saturday over her insistence that it was not the person who "discovered" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "lawful, bad and dishonest."
The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what is happening in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at anger, when you look at people who are angry, wicked, bad, and dishonest," he said.
When you look at the leaked publications and then people say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you the one who put the letter out?
Do you remember her answer... did you draw the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't take it out."
Wait a minute.
We didn't pull it out... No, we didn't," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent the letter with the details of the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford and the document came out earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not disclose her story," Feinstein told the commission.
She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her as she asked me to.
But apparently her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during Saturday night's debate: "In my opinion, the gestures really left to be desired.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen a weaker gesture before.
Defending the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said Democrats are using alleged charges to achieve their goals.
They are determined to regain power at all costs.
They don't care who they hurt, who they should violate to take power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars compensated for Friday's loss to the Belfast Giants in the Champions League challenge, winning the 5-3 return match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly advanced to the double edge thanks to the shocks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the score for the local team before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the advantage.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This was the third loss of the season, in the Elite League, to the believers of Adam Keefe, who on Friday evening returned from a disadvantage, to defeat Dundee 2-1, in Belfast.
This was the fourth match between these teams this season, with the first three won by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assistant to Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford gave the assist to Beauvillier, who doubled the score, four minutes later.
During an intense first half, Sullivan returned the locals to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped draw Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got the advantage ahead of the break by scoring his second goal of the evening, at the end of the first half.
The locals were regrouped and Bouchard returned to the draw with a strong strike at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined with Nielsen, who gave Dundee the lead for the first time in this challenge, at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal, scored in the last half.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five matches on Friday, will play their next home game against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller loses his life by ensuring that hundreds of people on a plane escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after losing his life making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people landed safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area and many people are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the powerful control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed to make sure that the 6321 Btik Air flight, which was on the runway at the time, could be launched safely.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman Yohannes Siriat said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
This news breaks our soul," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the local disaster mitigation agency says entry into Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is limited.
It is believed that this number will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the rubble, while others have not been found," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
The waves that reached up to six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Friday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing supplies and aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings troops.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets have been looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I am asking you to work day and night to carry out every task related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia hit earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
Micronesia plane crash: "Air Niugini" now says a person has been lost after a plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline that ran a plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia has now declared a missing person, having previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane being submerged in water.
In a press release, Air Niugini said they were not finding a passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boat helped to rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been escorted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the consequences of the events themselves remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon after failing to reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed too low.
That's an incredibly good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the waistline level, he and other people managed to reach the plane's emergency exits.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and were screaming as he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to repair a nearby scaffold helped to rescue them, using an airboat to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to about 30 feet (100 feet) under water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show 111 people have died in clashes with airlines registered in PNG in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of them.
Analyst builds night chronology when a woman is burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its arguments in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours in the capacity of the expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used the phone data to reconstruct the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night the latter died.
According to The Clarion Ledger reports, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of her death, a fact that refuted his earlier claims.
When the data revealed that his mobile phone was in the same place as that of Chambers while he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to him.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that evening, the man said "he's lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is Tellis's statement, which said she had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted messages, calls and contact data from his phone.
He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to give the closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said the jury would make the decision that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A three-member hip hop group seeks to challenge the negative views of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has been removed from its origins of political messages and messages that dealt with social issues.
They want to return to their origins and make conscious hippies known again.
In the UK, there has been a resurgence of artists like The Fugees and Common unlike artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
Dada from New York sued the couple for leaving work after receiving a "racist" message.
A New York babysitter has sued a couple for discriminating for leaving work after receiving a message mistakenly sent by a mother who complains that she was "another black man."
The couple have denied being racist, calling the lawsuit "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her concern when she found out that the young girl, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman when she appeared on her first working day in 2016.
JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, Another Black Man," Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman, "feeling embarrassed," fired Ms. Maurice, on the grounds that their current nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead, she wanted a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her only day of work and then sent home with a "cash in her pocket."
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for leaving work, and is seeking compensation at $350 a day for a six-month period, for which she was hired, though without a contract.
I want to tell them they shouldn't do that," she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination.
The couple has denied the allegations that they are racist, saying Maurice's departure was the right move, as they feared they could no longer trust him after they insulted him.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," the husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
But would you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been disrespectful, even though you were wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Tell me."
Considering the lawsuit as "extortion," Plasco said he and his wife had given birth to a child two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
Can you take revenge on someone in this situation?
It's not a positive thing to do," said Plasco, an investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has swiftly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington's publishers were afraid readers would not make connections with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel a great pleasure now that we have seen the extraordinary success of Paddington.
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would be angry if his work were rejected, adding that the book's 60th anniversary, last year after his death, contained "sadness and happiness."
As for Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of the success.
He was a quiet person and did not boast," she said.
Paddington was so true to him that it was like having a child who succeeds: you feel proud of him even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington's own character.
My daughter was dying and I was forced to say goodbye by phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors had tried to save her life but with no result.
Nad used to call me regularly to tell me it was too heavy, that he didn't believe it would do it," said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad who told me she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Now, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
Medications that had given doctors to keep her heart at work were losing effect and were slowly moving away from her system.
She had died a few years ago and now everything is going off.
I was forced to sit down and wait, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
You have to be strong."
Over time, Ms Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers - who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
No one knew," she said.
I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight I felt a great pity for Nad.
I felt like he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who wear black post letters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters with inspiring messages on a bridge in Wales as well as phone numbers of people who can call them for support.
Davis' son was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, based in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "sticky smile."
Everyone knew him for his smile.
People always say that his smile lights up every room.
However, he gave up his job before he died, as he was "in a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who at the time was 11 years old, was the man who found his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs Davis said: "I am constantly worried that it will have a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters, "to let people know that there are people who can help them and with whom they can talk, even with a friend.
Don't sit alone - you have to talk.
Ms Humphreys, who has been Ms Davies' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye and didn't take any action.
She said his death was a major trauma to them, but that they must overcome: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We were destroyed.
We all have to move forward and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the thread behind the FBI investigation
I thought if we could give him something similar to what he was looking for - a limited investigation on time and on the object - maybe we could bring a little bit of harmony," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "disintegrating" between multiple opponents' barriers.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters investigate the FBI?
All of them come as a result of time.
The election for Congress is just five weeks away, on November 6 - if Republicans turn out badly, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to elect the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying for them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
It will be voted on in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh could gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to end the situation and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of the Union in South Korea, said there were about 1127 desertions last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were tighter controls on the borders between North Korea and China, as well as higher tariffs required by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most defectors from North Korea get citizenship from South Korea.
Seoul said more than 30 000 people from North Korea had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee to China, which has the largest length of the border with North Korea, and can be crossed more easily than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected by multiple forces.
China considers migrant deserters illegal, not as refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and their talks focused on delayed negotiations on denuclearization.
The meeting came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed, in general, to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress until then.
Without trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm first," Ri said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he is not worthy to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that because of his temperament, he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I can't help thinking that if a woman had ever behaved like that, people would say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very concerned and at some point almost shouted or "talked out" when he talked about his family and high school years.
He accused Democrats in a statement before the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack on his figure," organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony constituted evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court after she showed his prejudice towards the Democrats.
I think he penalized himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was reluctant to answer the question of whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a no-confidence motion in the event of his nomination, and if Democrats win the majority of seats in the House of Representatives.
Let me tell you - if he's not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's unqualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings on his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
It's not the time for a hysterical and biased person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say, 'Oh, how good!'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
This is a fair verbal attack, months and years of anger that erupts, and it fails to lead to the end without crying.
We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what about you?
She continued, "A woman who worked in a leadership position helped me a lot, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but had devised a style that whenever she was angry and started to cry, to tell the interlocutors, "You might think I'm upset and that's why I'm crying.
But I'm actually angry."
And then she continued to talk.
And I thought that was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way of expressing anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men dominated, and at one point I found myself crying out of irresistible anger, was the moment a bigger woman grabbed me by the throat - a cool manager I've always had a little bit of fear - and pushed me to the stairs.
Don't ever let others see you cry," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset, and they'll be glad they made you upset."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Hart was found in the middle of an extramarital relationship aboard a boat named Monkey Business and pulled out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, extremely angry, realized that there was no reason not to think about running for president himself.
This was not a well-balanced decision," she said, laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
One called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was in its final stages, she was left behind with fundraising, so she vowed not to compete unless she managed to raise $2 million.
But it was a pointless war.
She found that some of her supporters who gave her $1000 to men only gave her $250.
Don't they think I'm being cut off?" she asked herself.
During her speech announcing that she would not run an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion — gratitude to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism — that she drowned.
It looked like I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
It looked like Kleenex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember thinking about what people would write on my gravestone.
She's crying?
Advantages of the U.S.-China trade war for Beijing
The first bursts of trade war between the US and China were deafening, and as the war is far from over, a rift between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing taxes on key Chinese export goods, including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
The most significant escalation was the one that occurred this week, when new tariffs hit $200 billion worth of goods (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods that entered the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated "in kind" every time, recently imposing tariffs of between five and ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to return the U.S. with the same currency, and the world's second-largest economic power is unlikely to be delivered soon.
Removing the measures from Washington means surrendering to their demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing to publicly bow to the US.
However, experts said that if China plays its cards properly, the pressures coming from the U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run to reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that political decisions, taken rapidly in both Washington and Beijing, can cause economic decline in each of these countries, is something far more dangerous than what has been seen from abroad," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the new U.S. security research center, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the devastated country from a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualm said conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from where they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that hit their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moalem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated state.

Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup trophy after beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10,5 at Le National Golf, on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive games on European soil and has won this trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team managed to get the 14,5 points it needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the player who faced the most difficulties during the tournament, took the first blow to the water and closed the 16th hole with 3 shots more than the given level, losing the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players who have achieved 5-0-0, since the current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup final.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has played in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European player of all time in this tournament, with 255 points in his career.
Usually, I don't cry, but today I can't stand myself.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have recovered the cup.
Success is the team's, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to help them," Garcia said after winning the European team.
He passed the word to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods, in direct challenges on Sunday.
I feel a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that player," Rahm said.
Woods lost all of his matches in France and now has 13-21-3 stats, during his career at the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranking second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to take the ball to the right place, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fury spoke after his team's disappointing appearance, "I'm proud of these guys.
There were a few moments during this morning when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We will regroup, work with PGA in America as well as with our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We've got to take the hat off.
They played better than us."
