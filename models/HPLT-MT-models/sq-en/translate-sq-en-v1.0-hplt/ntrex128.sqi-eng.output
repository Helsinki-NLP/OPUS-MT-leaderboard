Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they “look like fools”
Among some of the members of the Assembly a concern has spread about the proposal to change their title in MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This has come as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly in the “Parliament of Wales”.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this may induce ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his group was concerned "that this rimon with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In the Welsh, twp means “bulla” and wp means “has”.
A Welsh Party deputy said the whole group was “unsatisfied” and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was “minding” about the name change, but he said there was little difference between the words “MPW” and “Budalla”.
In this context, the spelling of the letter “w” in Welsh is similar to that of the letter “u” in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission currently drafting the legislation on name change, said: "Of course the final decision for naming Members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Government of Wales of 2017 law gave the Welsh assembly the seat to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation, and the proposal of the latter to name the assembly as the “Parliament of Wales” found widespread support.
Regarding the issue of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission favored the appointment “MWP Members of the Parliament” or “WMP”, but the alternative “MWP” found more support in a public consultation.
Apparently, members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative choices, but the fight for achieving consensus can be turned into a headquarter for President Elin Jones, from which the adoption of the legislation on changes within a few weeks is expected.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes regarding the functioning of the assembly, including the rules for the exclusion of Members of the Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of the legislation, the final vote on the issue of their appointment will remain to the Members of the Assembly.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing the name of the country.
On Sunday, the voters will vote for a change in the name of their country in the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
Voting by the people was put in an attempt to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which has also a province called Macedonia itself.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim over its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO accession requirements.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, said he will not recognize the votes.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells fall silently, as churches in Harlem face difficulties
Historically, the elderly people I talked to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today both are missing."
He said that the extinction of bars is understandable.
In today’s days, people socialize in other ways,” he says.
"Barets are no longer neighborhood meeting points, where people go regularly."
As for the churches, it is expressed concerned that the money from the sale of properties will not last as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by mansions full of people who will not support the holy places that have remained in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy residences in these buildings are white,” he said, “so very soon the day when these churches are closed once and for all, as most of the people who are placed in these dwellings will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem turned into a metropolis of colored people – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists was transferred in the 1930s.
The building was acquired by a congregation of people of color, who had had their place of worship nearby.
Saint Martin spent a congregation of people of color under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority traders in the “125th” Street, a major street of stores in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after the parishers of Father Johnson made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the cartoon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson, and heir of St. Martin, proudly called the "campa of the poor."
The expert who played in the karion in July called it something completely different: "A cultural treasure" and an "indeterminable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said that this was the world’s first brown-collared cartoon, Dionisio A. Lind, which was transferred to a larger rift in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not replaced him.
The events in recent months in Saint Martin have been a complex narrative of architects and contractors, some sent by the secular leaders of the church and others from the episcopal diocese.
The council - the leading organ of parish, composed of secular leaders - wrote diocese in July, with the concern that it would “try to transfer costs” to the parish council, despite the fact that the latter was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishers complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injures the 13-year-old during a diving to catch the crabs in California
A shark has attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to seize crabs in California on the day of the crab season opening, officials are expressed.
The attack took place just before 7 am, near Beacon’s beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said about KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then driving toward him together with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought that the boy was simply out of the grip of a crab, but then “I realized that he was shouting “I was bitten!
He bitten me!”
Hammel says that when he came to the boy, he saw that his entire clavila was torn.
I cried out for all to go out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's hospital "Rady's" in San Diego, where he was declared in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack was unknown.
The captain of the coastal guard Larry Giles spoke at a press conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was defined as a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Officials banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablanca for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for entry into the UK's cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic large shop style pavilions, with a specialized sales staff.
In the framework of a significant effort to enter the UK’s £2.8 billion cosmetic market, which is continuing to grow while sales of fashion and household furnishings experience decline, the largest cosmetic pavilions will be tested in 11 stores around the country and will spread in more stores the following year if they prove successful.
Investing in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill in the shelves that you used once for television, microwave and household furnishings.
Sainsbury’s has said that he would double his offer of cosmetic products up to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. Paww.
Even the existing lines from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will be given more space, with areas dedicated to relevant brands, similar to those located in stores like Boots.
Also, the supermarket will throw back its boutique cosmetic line in the market, so that most of the products are of vegan composition - something that is increasingly required by younger age buyers.
In addition, the retail dealer of the French Shop will test the concessions in two stores of Sainsbury’s, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, while a second is expected to be opened later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and a trend towards daily buying food in small amounts in neighborhood stores mean that now supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury’s, has said that the outlets will start to look more and more like big stores, while the network of supermarkets tries to fight Aldi’s and Lidl’s price reductions with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has put “argos” deposits in hundreds of stores and has introduced a series of “Habitat” that after buying two years ago, which according to him has boosted food sales and made the most profitable purchases.
The earlier effort of the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a union of companies with Boots in the early 2000s but the union disbanded after a debate on how to allocate income from pharmacies to its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury’s sold his pharmaceutical business of 281 shops to Celesio, the owner of the pharmaceutical network “Lloyds”, for 125 million pounds.
He said that “Loyds” would play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look of our cosmetics pavilions to improve the environment in favor of our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, which will be ready for giving advice.
Our brand range is designed to suit every need, and attractive environment and convenient locations indicate that we are already an enticing cosmetic destination, which differentiates the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "burned" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den, Peter Jones, has left "burned" after television presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from an agreement of 11 million pounds with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, to focus on its new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Willoughby has no time for their own brand of household furnishings and accessories “Truly”.
The business of these two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s “Goop” brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of “This Morning” approached Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated the star of the Dragons Den, Peter Jones, after the last withdrawal from their lucrative business dedicated to a certain lifestyle - to focus on her new promising contracts with “Marks & Spencer” and “ITV”.
Sources say Jones was "burned" when the golden television girl agreed during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that its new agreements - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant that it was no longer time enough to devote themselves to their home furnishings and accessories "Truly".
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s “Goop” brand and was expected to double its estimated wealth of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, addressed Instagram to declare her departure from Truly, Jones flew outside Britain to one of his vacation homes.
One source has been expressed: "Truly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term future that would accompany her over the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw left to all persons absolutely involved stunned.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close to the opening.
In the Marlow offices there is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold."
Experts think that removing the presenter of "This Morning", which is among the most successful British stars, can cost the firm millions, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to household clothing and vessels, and cause further delays in opening it.
And this can be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as her director in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent of shares in Baldwin’s television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of “I’m A Celebrity” or ITV.
Last evening, a source near Jones is saying "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
Fierce conversations “and then we fell in love”
He made a joke about the criticism that he would receive from the news media because of a comment he would consider some to be “not worthy of a president,” and because of the positivity regarding the North Korean leader.
Why was President Trump so much delivered?
He said Trump mocking the voice of the newsmakers.
I did not give up at all.
He said that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as their first meeting in Singapore in June was greeted by Trump as a big step towards North Korean de-escularization.
But the negotiations for decompilation were disrupted.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading diplomat Ri Yong Ho has addressed world leaders to the UN General Assembly on Saturday saying that the North sees no “responding response” to the first steps taken by North Korea for decommissioning.
On the contrary, he says, the US is continuing the sanctions aimed at putting pressure on it.
Trump made a much more optimistic view in his talk.
" Things are going to us best with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have an excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - interruption of missile testing, help with the release of hostages and return home to the rest of the U.S. military personnel.
In his address to the relations with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
It is very simple to behave like the President, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing towards the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the relocation of more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population, no national catastrophe was announced, which is a prerequisite for the catalysis of international assistance.
Unfortunately, they have made it on many clear cases that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a bit challenging,” said Ms. Sumbung.
While “Save the Children” is setting up a team to travel to Palo, it is still unknown if the foreign staff can work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Paul to see if international agencies were allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Given the frequent tremors of the land Indonesia suffers, the country remains highly unprepared for nature’s anger.
While in Aceh there were shelters against the tsunami, they were hardly encountered in other coastal areas.
The obvious lack of a siren for the warning of the tsunami in Palau, despite being issued a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best conditions, travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for the treatment of victims of the earthquake is traveling to Paul, but it will need at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo used Indonesia's lame infrastructure as a central point of his election campaign, and invested generous amounts of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has worried the administration of Mr. Joko, while he is in front of the new elections that will take place next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressures from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of trust.
More than 1000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have moved from their homes after the clash of Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where thieves, bows and arrows were used, and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge's Liverpool score a draw goal against Chelsea in the last minutes
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at the location of about 30 yards away from Chelsea's gate, while his team lost 1-0.
He pushed the ball easily to his left before making a kick towards the far gate.
The ball flew over the area until it diverted to the right corner of the net.
The ball escaped the jump in the air of Cape Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"The goal was to settle in the correct position properly to get the ball and gamers like Shaq play always with the balls forward, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," said Struridge for LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw the Kanta coming, I checked the ball at a touch and did not think too long but just hit."
Chelsea presided over 1-0 in the first half, after a 25th minute goal from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker made a reassurance to Mateo Kovacic during that game, before turning near the field and heading with the sprint towards the Liverpool semifield.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the midfield.
He then gave a beautiful vertical pass that he brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard switched to the speed duel and a left-wing shot scored in the second column, passing the ball behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker's arms.
Liverpool will face Napoli at the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 pm, at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the European UEFA League video on Thursday at 3 pm in London.
The number of dead from tsunami to Indonesia goes to 832
The number of deaths from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, the national disaster agency said in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many have remained trapped under the ruins of buildings demolished by the 7.5 earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet high, said the spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo agency at a press conference.
The city of Palau, with a population of more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been dumped under the ruins of collapsed buildings.
The police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman finds death from stabbing
An investigation into the murder was announced after the woman’s body was found at Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in the morning with wounds inflicted by the knife at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect for the murder.
The police called on the inhabitants of the area who have seen or heard anything appear for evidence.
The detective inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the early stages, but I would like to call on any person who has been near John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
Also, I would like to call on anyone, especially to taxi drivers, who may have captured film footage, to contact us as they may have essential information about our investigation.”
A police spokesperson confirmed that the victim was Birkenhead’s resident and her body was found inside a house.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman have arrived on stage to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigations are continuing, while the police have said that they are notifying the families of the victim.
A residential taxi driver in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He has been left speechless when he has discovered the event.
Now, the residents are being notified that they will be allowed to enter their homes only after a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the whole area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has arrived full of tears on the crime scene.
She repeats the words “this is terrible” over and over again.
At 2 o’clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the perimeter and another van was outside it.
A number of officers were positioned inside the perimeter, monitoring the residential block.
Every person who has information is invited to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers" anonymously at 0800 555 111 by selecting the code 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in the Parliament, the most recent monument affected by the debate on “the rewriting of history”
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical puritian followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "insanity" and "attempts to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the president of the Cromwell Association, said: "At the current debate on the removal of statues, there was an inevitable targeting of the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a sacrificing of the wrong Cromwell for his predecessor Thomas's actions in the past century.
The excellent portrayal of Cromwell by Sr William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure for which many think he deserves yet to be celebrated to his praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said about “The Sunday Telegraph”: “Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of the parliament by external pressure, which, of course, in his case, was the monarchy.
The fact that this is a completely correct portrayal is the object of continuous historical debates.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure known which represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and reminded."
Killer pig wound to death Chinese farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a torn art and covered in blood near a pig stall in the Liupanshi market in Guizhou province, reported “South China Morning Post” Sunday.
A pig farmer gets ready to inject pigs vaccine into a stall on May 30, 2005, in Xining of Qinghai province, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his cousin from neighboring province Yunnan on Wednesday, to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a pigs stall nearby open.
He said that a large male pig was in the stable with a blood mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that €550 was injured the farmer by death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and maimed", his cousin, identified with the surname "Wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang, said.
In images filmed by the security camera, Yuan has been seen entering the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has told the news of the evening that the pig was kept in isolation to prevent any other attack, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to reports, the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people attacked by pigs are marked even before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing husband serious wounds.
Ten years ago, a pig 650 pounds captured a Welsh farmer after his tractor, until his wife drove out the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that they are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as “instigators.”
"They just want to play.
They are like very curious babes... their aim is not to hurt.
You just have to show them the right respect,” he said.
The consequences of Hurricane Rosa is expected to bring large rainfall in the U.S. Southwest
As predicted, the power of the Rosa hurricane is softening as it moves towards the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, during the following days, Rosa will cause flooding in Northern Mexico and the southwestern US.
On Sunday, at 5 o’clock in the morning, Rosa was accompanied by 85 miles per hour speed, being classified as hurricanes of Category 1, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move toward the North on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low atmospheric pressure begins to form on the Pacific ocean, which is moving towards the East in the direction of the U.S. West Bank, while Rosa is expected to approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will continue to push huge tropical humidity towards her north, towards the southwestern US.
On Monday, Rosa will cause rainfall up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the interaction of tropical humidity with the low atmospheric pressure area will cause strong rain showers in the coming days with wide stretch to the southwest.
Locally, rains with a height of 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, waste leakage and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause the rainfall rate in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of precipitation is expected in some areas of the Southwest, mainly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of rapid deterioration in the conditions due to the distributed nature of tropical precipitation.
Due to the risk of tropical precipitation, it is not advisable to walk around the desert.
Big rainfall can convert canyons into powerful rivers, and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust storms into the area.
The low atmospheric pressure zone approach will bring great rain to some parts of the southern coast of California.
The total level of precipitation can reach over half an inch, which can cause small debris flow and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first precipitation of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday morning, before rain is extended on Monday and Tuesday night.
Strong rainfall will be spread on all four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the US can be characterized by large temperature fluctuations, falling temperatures in the Arctic, while tropics remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperatures over short distances.
A good example is the drastic difference of temperatures across the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
Over the following days, the remaining summer heat will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good part of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to start October with warm temperatures, at the average of 80, from the Southern Fields to certain parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high chances of temperatures above the average in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have attended the trial session of Brett Kavanaught
Over 20 million people have followed the interesting testimony of the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanough and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was suspected of taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, and broadcasters cut off regular programs to broadcast the turn back in the last minute of Friday events: an agreement reached by Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake on conducting a one-week investigation by the FBI on allegations.
Ford spoke before the Senate Judiciary Committee that it is 100 percent sure that Kavanough had touched him while he was drunk and tried to undress him at a high school party.
Kavanough, in an ardent testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that the number of followers has been greater than that of 20.4 million people, reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channel and MSNBC.
Figures for other transmission networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems with the number of viewers from the offices.
To set this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football eliminating or with that of Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinionists have strongly supported the Kavanaugh nomination, headed other networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, said Nielsen.
ABC came second to 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest continued to be high even after the end of the court session.
Flame was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday while facing the screams of protesters while trying to board the elevator to go to the judicial session of the Judicial Committee.
In CNN's live broadcast, he appeared standing with his eyes down for a few minutes as he was reprimanded.
I’m standing here, right in front of you,” a woman said.
Do you think he is telling the country the truth?
He said to him, “You have the power, while so many helpless women are in power.”
Flaka said that his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering the moment directly when the Judicial Committee would vote for the transition of the Kavadarci candidate to vote in front of all members of the Senate.
But Flake said that he would do this only with the conviction that the FBI would investigate accusations against the candidate during the following week, as democratic minorities had demanded.
Flame was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and some other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flame's choice was smart, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanough without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has asked the opening of an investigation by the FBI on the allegations against Kavanaught.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing political games” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union that they are “playing political games” with the future of Britain and compromising national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her plan for Brexit, the so-called “Chequers”, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to tax on behalf of each other is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims gun murder: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the player of the LSU
The police arrested a suspect in a Wayde Sims gunshot, a 20-year-old LSU team basketball player.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and interrogated in the prison premises under the accusation of premeditated murder, the Police Directorate of Baton Rouge said.
Official sources have released the video confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police says Sims had lost his glasses during the clash.
The police have found glasses at the scene and say that they have found traces of Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB's subsidiary of CBS.
After interrogation Simpson, police said he admitted that he had shot weapons over Wayde causing his death.
The amount for his release is set in the amount of $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The office of the Eastern Municipality Legal Doctor of Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death has been a wound caused by firearms from the head to the neck.
The department thanks the task force of the fugitives at the Louisiana State Police, the forensic laboratory of the state police, the South University police and the citizens of the area, for the help of investigations that led to the author’s arrest.
LSU’s athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the law enforcement authorities in the area for their “diligence and for the establishment of justice in the country.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The boy with a length of 6 feet and 6 inches grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had played basketball for the LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 strokes for each game.
On Friday morning, basketball team coach LSU, Will Wade, said the team was "sippable" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"For this we worry all the time," Wade said.
The volcano casts grace on the city of Mexico
Grace from the Popcatepel volcano has reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was re-launched and recorded 183 releases of gases and ashes within 24 hours.
The center had monitored a number of thunder and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin layers of grace that had covered car windows in some quarters of the city of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have found an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) in the southeast of the capital, since a 7,1-degree earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police collides with the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people have been detained in Barcelona on Saturday after the clash of pro-independence protesters with police peacekeeping forces, while thousands of people have joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalan polarizing voting for the secession.
A group of pro-separatists disguised, surrounded by peacekeeping police forces, stabbed with eggs and powder paint creating dark dust clouds across the streets that usually engulfed by tourists.
Later during the day there was also a mockery, while the police had to use the rubber sticks to end the collision.
For several hours in a row, repeating the slogan “We do not forget, we do not forgive”, pro-independence groups faced the union protesters shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for light wounds received during the protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where pro-independence sentiments prevail, tensions continue to remain high one more year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, despite the fact that participation was low, as citizens opposed to secession boycotted the voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday night, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take another stream.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in the separatist protest along with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalan would gain independence in the future.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for the joy they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite the fact that in the local elections last December, a vital victory was reached, although with a close result, the Catalan-independence parties have had a hard time preserving this year, as many of their most popular leaders have voluntarily left the country or are in custody and waiting for trial for their role in organizing the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who was recording the protest on his police phone, said the conflict was fed by politicians of both directions.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison pending last year’s trial, stated that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
Throwing candidates for European elections is the best way to counter the democratic values and the oppression that has been done to us by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonerry: Some people arrested after the car crashes into the house
Three male ages 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car crashed several times with a home in Londonderry.
The incident happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, around 19:30 BST.
The Bob Blemmings detective inspector said that damage has been caused to the main gate and the apartment itself.
It is thought that at some point an arrow was inserted in the direction of the car.
The Menga hit forgives Livingston's a 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The team from a category below, Livingston surprised Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard the second defeat in 18 matches as team coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's crackdown proved crucial while Gary Holt's team equated with second-place Hibernian points.
Gerrard's team has not yet won an out-of-field meeting at Premiership, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which it is eight points.
But before, Rangers will wait in the house Rapid Vienna, in the game worthwhile for the League of Europe, on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the series of consecutive victories in six meetings and coach Holt has not yet proved the defeat that when he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses cases against unsettled opponents well
The Holt team should have been taking advantage of many minutes before scoring, as their direct attacks caused to Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but hit the poor at the gate, while Alan Lithgow kicked off in the backside after being handed upside down by Craig Halkett.
Locals were willing to let Rangers play before them, knowing they could cause problems in standard shocks.
And this is how the goal that set the meeting was scored.
Rangers caused a penalty kick and Livingston created the space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to create the opportunity for Menga, who hit and scored in the center of the area.
Until that moment, the Rangers had dominated in holding the ball but the local defense had resulted to be impassable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly had never been put to the test,
This game mode continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a reception.
Scott Pittman's kick was kicked off by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor while Lithgow kicked off by another standard Livingston stroke.
The arcs were constantly coming to the Livingston area and were continually cleared, while two penalties for the penalty - after the intervention of Halket against the player who came as deputy Glenn Middleton, and another touch by hand - were not taken into account.
Game 'Fenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to the arena Tony Macaroni
A performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they played brilliantly and continued to exceed the expectations on this growing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team haven’t changed much since their return to the top, but a great merit belongs to Holt about how it has electrified the team since its arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was extraordinary, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga held them in trouble Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the match.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they played very well under the leadership of Gerard, they lacked quality.
Missing the final pass - only once managed to pass the opposing defense - and this is something that should serve as an alarm for Rangers, who find themselves among the table.
Erdogan is expected with his double feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) he was characterized by bright blue skies as Turkish and Germany leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – which aimed to regulate relations between NATO allies.
They have contradicted issues such as human rights, media freedom, and Turkey’s EU membership.
Later, Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city houses the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police stopped gathering a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but still many supporters took to the streets around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — many of whom were Kurds — also raised their voices to condemn both Erdoğan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
Opponent protests reflect the divisive ability of a hero worshipping by some Turks of Germany and despised as autocrats by others.
Road accident in Deptford: The rider dies after the collision with the car
A cyclist found death after crashing into a London car.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a traffic route loaded to Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the attendants immediately came, but the victim died at the scene.
The crash occurred several months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the scene, which took place in Children Street, about a mile away from the place of the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the person and to inform his family members.
Roads are closed and buses are announced to use other routes, while drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Height Prison: Six officers injured during a rebellion
Six prison officers were injured during a high security prison for men, the Prison Office said.
The rebellion erupted at HMP Long Upt in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and still continues.
The specialists of “Tornado” were called to keep the riots under control, including eight prisoners and which were limited to one side of the prison.
Officers have received treatment at the scene for some light wounds on the face.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: “The prison personnel with specialized training are mobilized to keep the incident currently happening at HMP Long High.
Six staff members received treatment for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and have made it clear that the responsible persons will refer to the police and may receive extension of prison sentence.”
HMP Long Martin shelters over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had been hospitalized after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, peacekeeping police officers were called to prison to keep a serious situation under control, where personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which can be an advantage for dry areas)
Although it rarely happens that a tropical depression hits Arizona, it is probably the first days of the next week, as the remaining power of the Rosa hurricane passes through the southwest desert, spreading immediate flooding risk.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of immediate floods for the day of Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, Southeastern California and Utah cities, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Lake Salt City cities.
Rosa is expected to take the lead to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday hours with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have received the status of storm or tropical depression in a radius of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Center of Hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches on the Moglon border of Arizona.
In other desert areas in the southwest, including central Rockies and Great Basin, precipitation is expected to be at level 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate floods, Rosa’s precipitation can be a blessing, as the region is hit by drought.
Although the floods pose a serious concern, some of these precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring centre, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme droughts in the second category,” the weather.com reported.
Initially, the Rosa hurricane will hit the Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still on the morning by hurricane power, with a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving northwards at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing cold waters above the Pacific, and therefore it is losing power.
Consequently, it is expected that the hurricane strikes Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or Monday night.
Rainfall over some areas of Mexico can be strong, presenting considerable risk to flooding.
" Rainfall of an average level of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, and can reach up to 10 inches", the weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move northward through Mexico, in the form of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday morning as tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her consequences are the strong rains in Baja California, in northwestern Sonora and in the southwest U.S. desert", the National Centre of Hurricanes said.
These precipitation is expected to cause immediate life-threatening floods, debris flows in deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
The attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for murder remaining in attempted
Three teenage and one 20-year-old boys have been arrested as suspected of remaining attempted murder after a 16-year-old with a knife in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelyor Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was escorted to the hospital, where he is currently in a “durable” state.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old was arrested at night in the Radstock area.
The officers have called for submission to anyone who might have caught a cell phone footage from the event.
Trump says Kavanaught “is confronted with the shamefulness and anger” of the Democratic Party
The "a pro-judge vote Kavanough is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling of western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaught "is confronted with the shamefulness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, denying with conviction and emotion the charge of Christine Blasey Ford that he had attacked him sexually decades before, when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a testimony during the session regarding her accusation.
On Saturday, the President said that on that day "the American people testified the greatness, qualities of character and courage" of Kavanough.
"A pro-appointing vote of Judge Kavanaught is a pro-voting vote among the most minded lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a pure public service record," he said before a support crowd in western Virginia.
The President mentioned the appointment of Kavanough during the speech on the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks separate us from one of our most important choices.
I won't run, but I'm contributing," he said.
"Therefore I am doing so much effort and fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to make "block resistance".
The first major procedural vote by the Senate on the appointment of Kavanough is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior WHO leader told CNN
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while figures are expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swallowed by the giant waves that clashed on the beaches, when the island of Sulawesi of Indonesia was hit by an earthquake and tsunam, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palau on Friday, when waves with elevations of up to six meters (18 feet) crashed into the shore in the twilight, compliciting and killing many people and destroying everything went forward.
Tsuami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"On yesterday, when the threat of tsunami was born, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and consequently did not run immediately and fell victim", said a press conference Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the Indonesian disaster prevention agency.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he took cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before hitting the coastline line.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
Airborne photographs published by the disaster agency featured a series of ruined buildings and shops, distorted and demolished bridges and a glass surrounded by water.
The tremors after the earthquake continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake queue felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by the massive earthquake on Friday was about three times the power of the atomic bomb thrown in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have multiplied the power of tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “very great” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were demolished.
Some bodies were found trapped under the ruins of demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the extent of damage can be much larger along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline in the north of Palau, in an area called Donggala, which is located closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication networks "completely interrupted without any warning" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were traveling towards affected areas.
"This has already become a tragedy, but the situation can worsen even more," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized as it had not given notice of the blow of Palau by the tsunami, despite the officials saying the waves had come at the time when the warning was given.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning passers-by on the road down to the arrival of the tsunami with furious shouts.
Within a few minutes, a wave crashes on the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters failed to instantly verify the authenticity of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, which cut communications across Paul, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army has started to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people continue to have great needs for food and other basic needs.
The city airport was reopened only for the rescue efforts and will stay closed until October.
President Joko Widodo expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims from tsunami in Indonesia goes over 800.
The situation is quite serious.
While the staff of the World Vision from Donggala has arrived smoothly in the city of Palau, where the employees are sheltering in the tarpaulin shelter (carried fabric) in the yard of their office, they proved scenes of destruction along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They confessed to me that they had seen many ruined houses", he said.
The situation is quite serious.
Although aid groups started serious efforts to set humanitarian aid mechanisms in motion, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were being prevented from traveling to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external staff can only begin to circulate if the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the regional level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "O.K., this is a national disaster", we can ask for national aid, but this status is not yet given".
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday in Palu, the friends and families of missing persons still had hope that the case of their loved ones would be some of the wonders that sometimes happen in case of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a well.
On Saturday, the forces of salvation released a woman who had remained in ruins two days, with her mother's body next to herself.
Gendon Subando, the coach of the Indonesian national parachutism team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for Asian Games, which were closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the people trapped in the hotel “Roa Roa”, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
As an old professional in the field of parachutism, I am very emotionally charged,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how in the hours that followed the news circulation of the collapse of the hotel “Roa Roa” between the parachutism community, he had desperately tried to write to WhatsApp competitors from Pauli, who were attending the festival on the beach.
However, his messages ended only with a gray-colored scaling, instead of two blue-colored markings.
"I think this means that the messages were not sent," he said.
Thieves steal 26,750$ during the replenishment of an ATM in Newport to Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Directorate, on Friday morning, some thieves stole 26,750$ from an employee of Brink, who was replenishing an ATM at the Newport of Levee.
The driver had been emptying an ATM at an entertainment center and was trying to disperse other money, wrote Detective Dennis in the statement.
While he was busy, someone "came running behind the employees of Brink" and stole a cash bag intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen some suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper will change his name to Ye.
Announcing the Twitter change on Saturday, he wrote: "officially known as Kanye West".
41-year-old West has been called nicknamed Ye for a long time, and used it as the title of his eighth album, which came to market in June.
The change has come shortly before his exit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album “Yandhi”.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the show, who could not come for “emotional reasons”, said the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current name of art, West has stated in the past that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think “ye” is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you” said West at the beginning of this year, talking about the title of his album with the radionative Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, we are.
I went from Kanye, which means “the only one”, in simply “Ye”, which is the reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is rather a reflection of what we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been otherwise known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared preferring Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, JAY-Z, has done as well with or without a dividing visa and capital letter.
The AMLO of Mexico vows not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged to never use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday in Tlatelollco Plaza, Lopez Obrador pledged that "will never use the army to crush the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops of the army opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when the left movements of the students were taking place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican young people by giving subsidized monthly students and opening more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are postponed for young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, the artificial intelligence printer and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments came after different parts of the U.S. government have announced artificial intelligence discoveries, despite the U.S. lacks a general artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
Double the budget for research in the artificial intelligence field would be a good start, since other countries are still very far behind the US and we are looking for a major next discovery in this field," Lee said.
Doubtling funding can double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence is done in the US, Lee said in an interview for CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "Superpowers of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinotion Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University “Carnegie Mellon”, he created an artificial intelligence system that passed to the American lead player in Othello, and then worked as executive director at Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee commended previous U.S. tech competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Field of Defense, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to help identify new visionaries.
Lee said often, researchers in the US need to work hard to get grants from the government.
"It's not China that is driving academic leaders away; it's corporations," Lee said.
Over the past few years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been employing bright minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be given automatically to people with the title of a doctor in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
In July 2017, China State Council issued the Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding to people in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of the Selection Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called “AI Next”.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year for artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a National Artificial Intelligence Commission has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to decide whether its name will be changed in the “Republic of North Macedonia,” a move that could resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its efforts for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, thinks that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its NATO and EU membership.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has questioned whether the participation in the elections will reach 50 percent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question in the referendum ballot reads: "Are you in favor of membership in NATO and the EU through acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the dissolution of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying for membership in structures like the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us", said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum does not have binding powers, a sufficient number of members of parliament have expressed that it will adhere to the voting outcome to make it crucial.
The name change requires a majority of two-thirds in the parliament.
State Election Commission said that no irregularities had been reported until 1st of the afternoon.
However, voting attendance was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
I came to vote for the sake of my children, we have the country in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on the change of the name of Macedonia, which would pave the way for the country’s NATO and the European Union to Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Opposite the parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and was setting up chairs in front of tents erected by the bankers of the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our head up, not entering the back door", said Kavadarci.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If we don’t want Macedonia’s name, we can address other countries such as China and Russia and join the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much needed investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
I think the vast majority will be in favor, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a positive result would "confirm our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Macedonia for Political Research, about 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - a figure below the necessary level of participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 percent of the participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent expressed that they would vote for pro.
For a successful referendum, the participation rate should be 50 per cent plus a vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the first strong blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its coming to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling saw all Brighton's defence in Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute seem extremely easy.
Argentina's fighter received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the action.
He led through three Brighton defenders, before coming out on an open field.
Then, Aguero found herself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He crossed a defender and crossed the speed duel several others at the entrance to the Brighton area.
Then he followed to the left where Sterling was located.
The English attacker used his exit in the area to pass the Agueros ball, which hit right-handed and crossed the Mathew Ryan goalkeeper by throwing the ball into the right corner of the net.
Aguero is suffering from a problem with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here’s what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the blues the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball into the halves of Brighton.
He verticalized beautiful for Laroy Sane on the left arm.

The blue striker took the ball to the net and then slide off the restrictive lines.
City will face Hofenheim on the valid challenge for the Champions League group stage, Thursday at 12:55 pm in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to maintain the role of “vulnerous” against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated by the chance of reaching the eliminating, there was no reason to impose another beginning.
But Schezer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is the opportunity to playoff for Rockies, who have an advantage with a match against Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
Rockies reached at least one option to playoff thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals, on Friday night, but are still trying to get the title of the division.
"Although we are playing without any motive, we can at least mark out by recognizing the atmosphere of fans here in Denver but also the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level against which we can face all year round.
Why not want to play in such a challenge?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will be the starter on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to start the meeting in such a situation.
Schezer, for which it would be the 34th appearance as a starter, conducted a training session on Thursday and could appear on the field on Sunday, which could be a normal day of rest for him.
The player from Washington, right-wing hunts is 18-7 with an ERA 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikouts" at 220 2/3 of the shots this season.
Trump picks up Western Virginia at the rally
The president referred to the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanough, before talking about the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
"November is crucial for everything we have done so far.
Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
That's one of the biggest choices -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this horrible group of radical Democrats, you see what is happening at the moment.
And they have divided the mind to regain power in any way, you see the disgrace of their filth.
They do not want to know who they hurt, who they press on their feet to take power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, but we will not give them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to make “the resistance of the blockade”.
"And you have seen this in the last days," he said, calling the Democrats "infuriated, cruel, fucking, treacherous".
He was referred by the Democratic Chairman of the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, Diane Feinstein, who sparked resentment from the audience.
"Do you remember its answer?
Did you spread the document?
He is, he’s, what?.
No, no, I... wait a little... - her body language was quite bad - it was the worst body language I ever saw. "
The Labor Party is no longer an “open church”.
She's non-tallerant to those who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted in favor of the motion of distrust towards me, I was not surprised so much.
After all, I am not the first of the Labor Party deputies to whom it is said that they are not welcome - all this because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, simply because he firmly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for the disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, regarding national security and Europe, an ironically similar matter to which Jeremy contradicted previous leaders.
In the announcement for the meeting of the Labor Party in Nottingham East, it was said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
For most of my eight-year period as a local deputy of the Labor Party, GC meetings have been like that.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a “softer and more polite” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It has become more and more obvious that the opposing views are not tolerated in the Labor Party, and any opinion is judged on the basis of its acknowledgment by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought I would share similar political views began to pretend that I would take a 180 degree turn and take positions I would never agree with - either on national security or the only EU market.
Every time I speak in public — no matter what I say — they explode criticism on social media, with people looking for my dismissal, they tell me that I shouldn’t be part of the Labor Party.
And I have not suffered that only me.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but do not shake.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is the normalization of the levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labor Party should feed a tolerance culture.
In reality, we are no longer an “open church”, and with any motion of trust and with any change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more and more closed.
During the last two years, I have often been advised to lower my head, not to be so noisy, and that so everything “will go well”.
But this is not the reason why I entered politics.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago as a school student, driven by the disregard of the government of Thatcher which led my class to a general school failure, I have tried to lobby for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a member of a local council or as a government minister.
I have never hid my policy, not even in the last elections.
Anyone in Nottingham East had clear my political attitudes and the points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all those who voted in favor of the motion on Friday, I only mean that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will touch our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, be it a member of the Labor Party: I feel proud that I am at your service and I promise you that no threat to download or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr irrevocable heads lists
The two delayed attempts may have changed the final result, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in the extremely fun match of the Tennent’s Premiership today.
Now they head the lists as the only invincible team among ten teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful defence and the courage to take risks that the local team won them, and coach Peter Murchie was completely right to be satisfied.
We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still invincible, so I'm normally happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, who took more risks than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, made into a goal by Frazier Climo, passed Ayr on the advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge by Warriors, allowed Melrose to show numerical superiority and Jason Baggot got an untapped ball.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first half, he scored and returned to the goal an individual action leading the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's attempt, turned into a goal by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Then, there was a long interruption as a result of heavy damage to the Ruardh Knott, who left with the stretcher, and after the start of the game, Ayr increased the result through an attempted of Stafford McDowall, marked by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was later punished with the yellow card, and Melrose used again the fact that they had a player more, with an attempt not returned to the goal by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a part with a harsh pressing.
However, locals returned and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with yellow cardboard because he prevented Climo, without the top, from the penalty line, MacPherson made "touch down", after Ayr's back of the trio that was advancing forward.
Climo scored and did the same as the game resumed, as Kyle Rowe captured the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and took before the attack player (flanker) Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the local team.
Still Game" star seems determined for the new career in the restaurant industry
The star of “Styl Game” Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hospitality industry, after it was revealed that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant chain.
56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis’s role in the famous BBC show, with co-screenist and co-protagonist his long-term partner in the comedy world, Greg Hemphill.
The pair has announced that the ninth season will be the last for this show, and it seems that Kieran is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source for Scottish Sun hinted that Kieran was trying to enter Glasgow’s “ flowering restaurant industry.”
The sea is ours": Bolivia landlocked hopes for the court to pave its way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol an improvisation of the naval fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue ocean flag.
On the sea bases from Lake Titica to the Amazons is marked the motto: "The sea is our property.
Retaking him is a task."
Through the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of taking the coast from Chile in a bloody conflict for sources during the 19th century is still quite alive – as well as the desire to navigate once again through the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are most likely ever for decades, while on October 1, Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five-year review.
Bolivia is characterized by jerk, spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course, is positively awaiting the result", said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the ICTY’s session on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia that – after decades of irregular discussions – Chile is forced to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign territory landlocked.
For Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for obtaining the second term in the next year's election - Monday's decision is quite important.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that it is very unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and that even if, they would change a little.
The U.N.-based body in the Netherlands does not belong to another country from the territory of Chile, and has said that it will not set the result of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICTY is coming up with a decision only six months after the final argument was heard shows that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert of international law.
And instead of helping with Bolivia, the events of the past four years may have penalized it.
The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's aggressive rhetoric has disappeared any traces of kindness remaining to the Chileans, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, opposed the idea that the court’s decision-making was surprisingly fast.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end the 139-year disputes, with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - was using the naval case for political interests.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean" he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to understand that we must leave behind the wings of the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be carried out as long as it cannot trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never perform the first disarmament of nuclear weapons, as long as it cannot trust Washington.
A speech was on Saturday in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to maintain promises made during a summit in Singapore between leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of reviving nuclear diplomacy so far "sleeping", more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, the hopes that the continued sanctions and opposition of the US to the declaration on the end of the Korean War will make North Korea kneel, are futile hopes.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make significant disarmament movements, Washington is reluctant to accept the statement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a broad skepticism regarding the seriousness of Pyongyang's intention to attract his arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of gigantic hats, which will come soon on the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your collection of hats or provide complete protection from sunlight, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a series of gigantic kinky hats for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which left open-mouth all designers in Paris Fashion Week.
Ultra-practical hats have been given on Instagram this summer, and these designers have taken their surprising creations to the gym.
The special creation of Valentinos was a highly extravagant beige hat, adorned with a spacious sanctuary with feather-like details, which surrounded the model's head.
Other great accessories included stone-adorned melons, a magician hat, and even a pineapple – but they are not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks - bash in time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had stitched edge and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
A creation resembled diving equipment, also complemented by the air pipe and water glasses, while another one resembled a melted ice cream cap.
And if you like to follow this bold fashion - you are lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats can come soon on the streets of your city.
The trend of the giant hats has followed that of “La Bomba”, the straw hat with the shelter of two wide legs, which we have seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that hides behind the extremely unpractical hat that got provided on social media brought another big piece on the catwalk – a beach bag of straws, almost as big as the model with bathing clothes that was holding it.
Colored orange bags, decorated with a refined knife and a large white leather handle at the top, was the most distinctive creation of the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The designer of the famous personalities Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “The next summer I foresee to see the hats and bags of giant beach on the streets of cities – as the stylist has left a huge impact as it would be difficult to ignore the demand for great accessories.”
John Edward: Fundamental language skills for global citizens
The private schools in Scotland hold the record for academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of excellent results in exams, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), try to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education of the highest levels, for their selected career and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored educational curriculum, we are proving how modern language branch continues to be a popular and well-liked choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, your words go to his ears.
If you speak to him in your own language, your words go to your heart."
These words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to create relationships with people from foreign countries.
From the results of this year’s recent exams, we can conclude that languages are leading the lists of results, with the highest rate of passing grades between private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the maximum grade A.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students had received the maximum grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying for German, 69 percent of those studying for French and 63 percent of those studying for Spanish had also received the grade A.
This shows that the private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, the branch of foreign languages is considered as important as STEM branches (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school curricula and beyond.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main difficulties faced by employers to supplement the vacancies, 17 percent of them related to the lack of language skills.
Consequently, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for preparing young people for their future careers.
With the addition of jobs that have as a condition of mastery of foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as the owner of such a long-term capacity.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person on competitors.
According to a YouTube survey, which involved over 4000 adults from the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a good foreign language enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only foreign language spoken by a percentage of 2 digits, namely 15 percent.
That is why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
Owning many languages, and especially mastering languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered the most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese languages.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a range of languages from which you can choose in private schools, with teaching staff composed of specialists in the field.
Private Scottish schools are committed to providing a school environment that will prepare children and “armed” them with the skills they need to succeed, however the future.
At these times, it cannot be denied the fact that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as " international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut fall le faire.

LeBron is expected to debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The reception is almost over for fans waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for Log Angeles Lakers.
The manager of Lakers, Luke Walton, has announced that James will play in the pre-season opening game Sunday against Denver Nuggets, in San Diego.
Yet it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"They will be more than 1 and less than 48", said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The correspondent of Lakers wrote on Tweeter that, most likely, James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season games program of Lakers.
"I don't need matches before the season at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's rally time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump launches a series of electoral rallies today in the evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first gathering of five such planned to be held next week, including stops in friendly areas involving Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval suspended for his election to fill the empty seat at the Supreme Court, Trump intends to create support for the upcoming mid-term elections Republicans risk losing control at Congress when the polls are conducted in November.
At what time does Trump’s rally take place today in West Virginia and how to follow it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place at 7 pm. Eastern time today in the evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow the Trump rally in West Virginia online below, through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearings at the Supreme Court of the candidate Brett Kavanaught, who was tense due to charges of improper sexual behaviour, with the alleged vote of confirmation by the Senate remaining a week while the FBI conducted an investigation into the case.
But the primary goal of these numerous gatherings is to help Republicans get a boost ahead of the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign staff said that these five gatherings in next week are intended to “give energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand most of them in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
The Congress control is so important to its agenda, that the President will travel to as many countries as we can while we turn to the busy season," a Trump campaign spokesperson told Reuters who did not want to be identified.
It is planned to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening rally could bring support from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia news agency “Metro News.”
The Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate Republican candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been behind the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him an impetus in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team showed willingness to fight while keeping their hopes alive by addressing singles on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the remaining four times for Sunday afternoon, it could be what the Ryder Cup needed.
This swinging of momentum, is a totally created sports concept, but a concept where players really believe and never more than in such races.
But where can we say that this momentum now feels?
"They had a six-point disconnect that has now gone to four, so we can say that a sort of momentum has been created somewhere, I believe," Jordan Spieth said while closing the day.
Of course Europe has the advantage of the four points ahead, when they remain in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth declares, Americans hope they are in their favor and have many things to be encouraged, in particular in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and received three of the four possible points.
Spieth has been relentless since the launch of shots to the pit and is leading by giving his example.
The holiday cheers were added as the round followed, inserting the golf ball with an easy kick to take the match to draw, when he and Thomas were previously two points down after two rounds.
His easy shot that gave them the victory of the match in the 15th pit was met with a similar cheer, indicating that he believes that the American team is still not out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your match," said Spieth.
All the players left now.
18 pits to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but adorable European couple, has realized four of the four and cannot be mistaken.
Molwood" was the only couple who did not catch a shot on the minimum afternoon of Saturday, but they also avoided firings on the minimum even on Sunday morning, Friday evening and in the second nine shots Friday morning.
This result and the way they seem to flow their energy to the enthusiastic crowd and vice versa reinforce the idea that they are players to beat Sunday and that there will be no other popular player than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets over "Le Golf National".
Preferably both at the same time in different pits.
However, the statements for a European triumph are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily succeeded by Sergio Garcia, the hero of four-way games when he got into the pair with Alex Noren.
A point over the minimum and two in nine in front placed the Spanish and the Swedish in a pit where they had no chance of getting out.
However, on Sunday no one will be there to help you get out of your pit.
Four-story and pair games are so stunning to follow up close because of the interaction between couples, the tips they give, the tips they don’t give and the way a strategy can change there for there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead to the final, but these four sessions also showed that the US team will still face even though some people, especially the States, have questioned this.
Europe leads 10-6 as it runs towards the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has an essential advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after being released from the four and paired games with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari presided over a two-win race against a Tiger Woods found in difficulty to increase their advantage to four points at 'Le Golf National'.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, offered to take the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over the team helpless in the double morning matches, bringing it to 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance in the four game, winning two games, but they could not reduce the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 individual Sunday games to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to have won four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed ‘Molliwood’, after a sensational weekend are the second couple in the history of the Ryder Cup that earn four points in their four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed into the quadrit game, they combined quite well together to defeat an helpless Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic 5&4 result.
Woods, who had two meetings on Saturday, showed occasional grandiose explosions, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 games in the four game and with pairs and 7 matches in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the fourth game of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the match and received a 2-1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third place in the world.
Europe had nothing in favor on a pretty and fresh day in the southwest of Paris.
Three times the professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the difference that should be captured by Americans on Saturday.
They won a bold victory 2–1 against the Spanish Jon Rahman and Ian Populter in the 4th matches and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the match after losing to the first two pits.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has turned the result after a difference between four points in individual games, although the Furyk holding team only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
However, as he was the second best player for two days, an attack on Sunday seems to go beyond their reach.
North Korea says it will not be disarmed ‘in any way’ unilaterally without gaining confidence
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the sanctions continued on Saturday were deepening distrust of the United States and the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world that North Korea has undertaken "important measures showing goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling areas where nuclear tests were conducted and pledging not to add the arsenal of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we are not seeing any answer to this from the US," he said.
Without trust in the US, our national security will have no security, and under these circumstances there is no way for us to disarm ourselves altogether."
While Ri repeated the usual North Korean complaints regarding Washington's resistance for a split "stage" approach to the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be valued due to the gradual steps it has taken, its statement seemed important because it did not exclude biased nuclear disarmament, as it has previously done Penian.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between an American incumbent President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump vowed to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has demanded an official end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has stated that the penny must initially give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to mitigate strict international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on the 'nuclear disarm' being carried out first and increases the pressure level through sanctions to achieve their goal in a way, even opposing the 'statement of the war,'" said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can ring us are dreams of people who are not informed about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our disbelief."
New did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement that the U.S. leader noted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the past five months and added: "If the pair on the nuclear disarming issue would be South Korea and not the US, the process of nuclear disarming in the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this situation without a way out."
Despite this, the tone used in the New speech was profoundly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the establishment of the US territory targeted by North Korean missiles was inevitable as Trump called Kim "the rocket man" with a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking the steps to disarm, but said there is still much work to do and that sanctions must continue to be active until North Korea carry out nuclear disarming.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying "If it's going to take two years, three years or five months - that doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward the Penis for steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "Implementation of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without prohibition until we realize full and final verification of nuclear disarming."
The Security Council has unanimously established the increase of sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to end the funding of the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of Penian.
Pompeo met with Ri aside at the UN General Assembly and then said that he would again visit the next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year already, but his last visit did not go so well.
He left Penian in July saying that there was progress, and only within a few hours North Korea denounced him as he had performed "mafioso-style requirements."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to disarm a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States will take "appropriate measures."
He said that Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he requested were security guarantees for which Trump pledged in Singapore and moved towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students get lessons on how to relax enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of ‘macows’ of study through the use of caffeine from these’s ‘saneous.’
An academic noted that university students number one in the world often do not know when it comes to the most basic things about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a Harvard Medical School professor and a specialist at Brigham and Women Hospital, prepared the lecture course, which believes it is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a reference to the impact that sleep deprivation has on learning.
At the end of it, a girl approached me and said to me, 'Why is this being said to me now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had talked about her first about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me,' he said about 'The Telegraph'.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to students the necessary elements how habits of a good sleep help academic and athletic performance, and also how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of university medical services, said the university decided to present this course after stating that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
On one side is a view of a dormitory room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books so that they can be explained to them the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the clock routine that needs to be spent on bed.
In another part, participants are explained how sleep deprivation in a long-term period increases the risks of heart attack, ischemia, depression and cancer.
A camp map, with interactive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – as you also have the right to know, the health impact when you choose to smoke,’ Prof. Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in spending ‘one-night sleep’ continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was an ever-growing problem.
Ensuring that you have received the sufficient dose of sleep, of a good quality, should be the ‘secret weapon’ of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads the brain to a hunger mode, making them feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied physical and chemical biology, assisted Professor Czeisler in preparing the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to turn him into a course for the whole camp.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all students of postgraduate studies to complete a similar study program before joining competitive institutions.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should place an hour with bells on when to go to bed, and also that when to wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of ‘blue light’ arising from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can get the biological pace of off-work sleep, which leads to problems of falling asleep.
Livingston 1 0 Rangers: Menga marks against the boys of Gerrard
Rangers took on another hit as visitors as the strike of Dolly Menga gave the disintegrated side of Steven Gerrard the 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was looking to record his first victory since the victory of February 4-1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team caused his second defeat in 18 Gerard matches as a coach, leaving his team eight points after the fugitive leader of the Ladbroke Premiership, the Hearts team.
The menga scored seven minutes before the first half ended and with a set of Rangers that seemed completely powerless to equalize.
While Rangers now falls into the sixth place, Livingston ascends into the third and is directly after the Hibernian for the differentiation of goals.
Rangers can expect to have more trouble after their winger Calum Spence was treated for a head stroke after being hit by a likely object thrown by the visitor fans.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which crossed the Air in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt introduced the same 11th field which caught a point of Hearts last week and that he would feel satisfied with the way his well-organized team strangles in every round.
Rangers may have dominated in holding the ball, but Livingston created more when he had it in possession.
They should have scored only two minutes from the start of the meeting, when the first pass that Menga gave Scott Pittman to the goal guarded by Allan McGregor, was not correctly exploited by him shooting the ball out.
A long cross from the kick from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, just shot him off on the back of the gate.
Rangers took control of the game but it seemed that they hoped more than realisticly believed in their game in the opposing zone.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after quarter-hours of play as he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson did not listen to Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to perform two shots at the gate in the first part, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by the headshot of Lassana Coulibaly and by the forceless blow of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livy's first goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was being seen in the field, but no one can deny that they deserved it only for the quarrel they showed.
Again Rangers failed in the long-term backing service for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who maintained the calm to pass the Menga and score in a simple way.
Gerrard acted on the break between parts while replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change for a bit as much as he did not give an immediate effect while the winger followed for Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran out of his position to block him.
But Livingston continued to make guests play as they want, where Lithgow and Halket followed each other long balls from time to time.
The Holt team could extend its head to the final stage, but McGregor stood hard and denied Jacobs before Lithgow hunted off by a ball taken from hitting the corner.
Replacing Rangers, Glenn Middleton later claimed during the game for another penalty, while he was entangled with Jacobs, but again Thomson allowed the advantage.
Almanaku: Geiger gauge inventor
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, As today 136 years ago and IN CONSTRUCTION... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as the Geiger gauge.
A main pillar of science since then, the Geiger meter became a main pillar of popular culture also, as in the 1950 film "Coronodo bells", with a cast of actors of seemingly non-professional scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Husband: "What the hell is it?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger meter that is used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms that are released from radioactivity to minerals."
Evans: "Do not tell me, I'm really listening now!"
Hans "Geiger" died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that holds his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system "to distinguish" bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system "to distinguish" bad cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory
They can ‘different’ a protein commonly found in many types of cancer and then reinjected
A vaccine that is in the test is showing promising results in patients who have some types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine who teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells noticed that cancer in the ovary disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they ‘different’ a protein commonly found in some types of cancer called HER2, and then to the re-injectation of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National American Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show us that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lung and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to exhalation of immune cells from patients "to teach" them how to detect cancer cells, has functioned in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West appeared in a Pro-Trump rally, wearing a hat with the MAGA inscription, after his appearance in SNL.
He didn't go right
Kanye West was fond of protests at the studio during a broadcast on the "Saturday Night Live" show after a disappointing interpretation where he praised US President Donald Trump and where he said he would run for this post in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night called "Ghost Town", where he was holding a hat on his head that wrote "Make America Great", he continued to speak with strong tones against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
How many times I talk to a white person and they tell me, "How can I like Trump, he is racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started its play with a parody that included Matt Damon, where Hollywood star came to the play the testimony of Brett Kavanough before the Senate Judicial Commission on sexual harassment allegations raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's strict speech recordings were uploaded on social media by Comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with that post or not.
West also complained to spectators that he had spent a difficult time behind the scenes because of what he had put on the head.
They mistreated me in the background.
They told me, ‘Don’t go on stage with that hat on your head.’
They mistreated me!
And then they tell me that I am sinking,” he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Would you see the infinity?", saying that "I put my superined hat on my head, because that shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try Love."
His comments captured whistles at least twice by spectators and SNL cast members seemed to feel ashamed, Variety reports, where a person told the newspaper: "The whole studio fell silent."
West was called a late substitute instead of Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many people with the interpretation of the song "I Love it", dressed as Perier bottle.
West was supported by the chairman of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner who posted on Twitter: "For one of the most courageous souls: Thank you for remaining in the front of the crowd."
But the moderator of the shows Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that West simply "was himself and this is extraordinary."
"But I choose to NOT reward someone (by buying music or clothing or supporting his "art", for whom I believe to disgrace and spread the ideology that is harmful to my community.
While he is free.
so we are and we," she added.
Before the show, the singer stated on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was already "the being formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to have changed the name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Paddy.
His rapper friend Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and the late Prince musical legend, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.

Game of Thrones’ star, Hartington Kit, hits toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordper in character Jon Snow, in the violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the stereotype of the male hero, saying that the appearance of such roles on the screen, makes young boys perceive that they should behave like strong to be respected.
Speaking of ‘The Sunday Times Culture’, Kit said that he believes that ‘something has gone wrong’ and was asked how the problem of toxic masculinity can be solved in the era of the #MeToo movement.
Kit, who recently married his actress colleague at "Game of Thrones", Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels 'very important' the solution to this issue.
'I personally feel this issue very important at the moment - where have we been wrong with the appearance of masculinity?', he said.
What have we learned to men as they grow up, about the problems we are facing now?'
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to very male characters appearing there.
He continued: 'What is born, and what is it taught?
What is taught on TV and what is taught in the street, that makes young boys believe that they should behave in a certain way to feel men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
Because obviously something has gone wrong with young boys.'
During the interview he also admitted that he would no longer run for the Game of Thrones after the series ended at the end of the next summer, saying that ‘the battlefields and horses have come to the top of his nose.’
From November, Kit will take part in a re-introduction to the stage of ‘True West’ by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a producer of films and his thief brother.
The actor recently indicated that the meeting with his wife Roze is the best thing he got from "Game of Thrones".
In this production I found my wife, so we can say that this show gave me the future family and determined my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte's role, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the award winning science series 'Emmy'.
The couple married in June 2018 at the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Sida: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and Sida.
There are more than 820,000 people affected across the country, the health authorities say.
In the second quarter alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Much of the new cases has been broadcast through sexual relationships, displaying a difference from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the blood transfusions infected.
But the number of people who get the HIV virus through this way had almost gone zero, officials of Chinese health said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and Sida in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was de-criminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT persons still prevails.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have measured that 70-90% of men having sex with other men, in the end will marry women.
Much of the transmission of the disease occurs due to inadequate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical drugs for the treatment of HIV as part of the attempt of hitting this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that data from GOP senators have spread by staff members, saying that these are ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conspiracy theory’
The US representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican senators on the pages of lawmakers in Wikipedia.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that these claims were being pushed by experts and online "right extreme" pages.
"Lies, lies and only disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the extracted information includes home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a hearing of Senate's erroneous sexual conduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanough.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaught.
Some conservative sites such as ‘gateway Pundit’ and ‘RedState’ reported that IP addresses identifying the source of publications were linked to the Waters office and extracted data of a member of the Waters staff, reports Hill.
This unfounded claim is totally untrue and a great lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - identity, personal information and security of which has been compromised as a result of these false and fabricated claims - has not been in any way responsible for the flow of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally false and a great lie."
Waters Declaration immediately faced online criticism, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is done frustratedly," wrote Fleischer.
"This means that it has no proper temperament of being a Member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, he should not get nervous.
It should not be a provocateur.
The accused’s motives should not be questioned.
He must be peaceful and peaceful."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing the Waters reaction to the criticism of the Democrats for Judge Kavanough, who was accused by critics of appearing too nervous during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is racing to take the Waters seat in the mid-mandate elections, also posted his Twitter statements.
"Great case, if it will be true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters said its office had signaled “the relevant authorities and law enforcement institutions over these false charges.
"We will make sure the authors are disclosed," she continued, "and for them to take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have a destructive and dangerous effect for everyone from my staff."
Screening of the film "Johnny English hits again" - a comedy with a no-equipped spy with content Rowan Atkinson
It has become the case that in every new British-influential film, it is seen for hidden messages related to the topic of Brexit and this finds implementation and on the stage of the comedy-action entrepreneurship "Johnny English" - which has its origins in 2003 with "Johnny English" and with the return of Johnny English.
Will this satirical comedy reveal how clearly unable we have connected to the new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, the eye-made character emerges, with the face as a rubber and seemingly the dot of Johnny English, has received the authorization to confuse things for the second time – his name, which shows more than anything else than that is a broad comical creature created for the territories where it is not spoken English, but that frequent the cinema.
Of course, he is a secret defective agent, who despite pretending to appear charming, has little from the Clouseau inspector, little from the character of Mr. Bean and a proportion of that type that contributed only with the release of a sound in the song ‘Chariots of Fire’, at the opening ceremony of the Olympics - London 2012.
He is also based on the man of mysteries, the traveler, and the international Atkinson, who once played on television ads that have now been forgotten of ‘Barclaycard’, leaving the country in chaos wherever he stepped.
There are one or two pleasant moments in the premiere of this film.
I liked it very much when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval breastplate, and the sheet of propeller crashed into his helmet a little.
This shows the gift of physical comedy that Atkinson commits, but the mood looks both lukewarm and sometimes excessive, especially when ‘serious’ movies like 007 and the Impossible Mission have introduced some comedy as an ingredient in their films.
Humor seems to be addressing children more than adults and the crunchy events of Johnny English are not so creative and are focused on silent movements, the same as what Atkinson performs on the Bean character.
The permanent theme as well as in this film is the fact that the UK is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has been infiltrated into the super-secret network of British agents, revealing the identity of British terrain agents and has lubricated the agent in charge - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister who appears as a pompous figure and ready for battle, who is already suffering an extraordinary political non-popularity: Emma Thompson does his best to realize the character that is similar to Teresa May, but there is not much text in the scenario that can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who has retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English himself, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-level neighborhood, but who unofficially taught how to become a secret agent: there are beautiful scenes, because English is offering a spy academy in the form of rock school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his former assistant, the much-preserved Bough, who again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-layer girl, where Vicki Pepperdine is used a little wrong on this role.
So Batman and Robin do the things totally backward in Her Majesty’s Secret Service, are again in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being fascinated by the attractive billionaire of technology who claims that he can solve the difficulties of British computers: the wicked Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their funny and deferative odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; they cause chaos while entering without permission into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English is totally confused as he tries to use the virtual reality equipment to get acquainted with the interior parts of Volta's house.
All sequences are normally made for the final stage, but despite being fun and loud, the whole thing looks a bit like a child's film.
Quite moderate things.
Even as in other films Johnny English, I couldn’t think: isn’t there the British film industry a role for Rowan Atkinson to suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies that there is a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days
The Labour Party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week — but be paid out for five.
The party reportedly wants the company chiefs to save by using the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for employees, giving them an extra day of rest.
We would see that the employees would enjoy a weekend with three days off - but by continuing to take home the same salary.
Sources said the idea would be “compliant” with the party’s economic agenda and plans to turn the country in favor of employees.
Going forward in a week with four working days is an idea that has been embraced by the Trade Union Congress, as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'Ahead the end of the year a review of policies is expected to be announced.
'It's not going to happen immediately, but a week with four working days it's an aspiration that matches the party's approach to balance the economy in favor of employees and also with the general industrial strategy of the party.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where the Green Party previously committed for a week with four working days during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, currently this aspiration is not being supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'A four-day week of work is not the party's policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Chancellor in the Shadow, John McDonnell, used last week’s conference of the Labour Party to convey his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to pass power from ‘anonymous directors’ and ‘beneficiaries’ to public service firms.
Shadow Chancellor’s plans also imply that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all their actions, because the Labour Government may carry out ‘ Discounts’ with the reasoning of actions considered as violation.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the board of companies and create Comprehensive Ownership Funds to surpass employees of 10 percent of private sector firms’ capital, which means a dividend paid year-on-year in values up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy show at "60 Minutes", if the FBI's investigation over the Kavanough could change their mind
FBI investigation over allegations against Judge Brett Kavanough has delayed a final vote on his appointment at the Supreme Court at least a week, and raises questions if the findings of the investigation office could affect any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent of the show "60 Minutes", Scott Pley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
I said when I was entering the hearing, I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaught.
I got it on the phone after this happened, so after the claims came out and I said, 'Have you done this?'
He was firm and clear."
However Graham's vote appears to be engraved in stone.
"I've shared my mind about Brett Kavanough and the difference would only make any bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And anyone she mentioned could not verify it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see something will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, a yearly musical show which features a large and impressive starlist that interpret and have an equally impressive mission as well; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host crowds with thousands of people at ‘Great Lawn’ in the Central Park who not only enjoy the interpretations of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be aware of the real purpose of the show, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the screening (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill a variety of tasks, or "actions" as a volunteer work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness about the achievement of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has been the Global Citizen Festival when they are left and 12 years to achieve their goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert work a real way to convince them to ask for these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known as "climate activation" - people who are making a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" has been said to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, giving a boost to different goals.
It is said that these actions have helped world leaders to declare 37 billion dollars of commitments and policies, which reportedly affect the lives of more than 2,25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and declarations as a result of group actions, with at least $10 billion already distributed or provided as funds.
The group calculates that the funds provided so far have given a direct impact to about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of UK-based investors and enforcement agencies, committed to "help children grow up with their full potential," promising that they will give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in this country, after receiving more than 4700 "cirations" from Global Citizen activists.
With support from the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn social malnutrition into a memory of the past," the ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition" told the crowd at a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after receiving 5000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government declared financing a project, "The Power of Nutrition," that will affect 5 million women and children who need nutrition.
In an answer to the most frequently asked questions on their website asking "What makes you believe we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as every high civic right and as the movements against apartheid in front of us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the actors who will perform on this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the navy for "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Internal Secretary
If necessary" Washington could rely on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from lying down in the markets, including the Middle East, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zince revealed, according to Washington Examiner's quote.
Zinc claims that Russia’s involvement in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the Syrian legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to this official there are ways and ways to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them, so as to ensure that the energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc is addressing participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit organization which has per personified itself as the "voice of energy customers" in the US.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to dealing with Iran's Russia, highlighting that these approaches are virtually the same.
"The economic option over Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuel," he said, as he referred to Russia as "a fraudulent light" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
Statements come after the Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump’s administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to take it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the firefighting opposition from Washington is made simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same opinion that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry in Moscow, in September.
The American attitude has come across opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to this project.
The German Industry Federation (BDI) has asked the U.S. to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of trouble when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the head of the German Industries Federation (BDI) after a few times ago meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" if he runs for presidents in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday he would "think seriously" the race for president after the mid-term election.
Throughout a city gathering in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our destroyed government, and that includes putting a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take my nomination for presidents seriously."
Warren hit Donald Trump during the city gathering, saying he "is taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaught.
In a quarter on Friday, Warren said "that we certainly need an investigation from the FBI before the vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday shows that a large part of Warren’s voters themselves don’t think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "potential" voters of Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the survey conducted by the University of Suffolk/ Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The survey showed that former governor Deval Patrick enjoyed the biggest support to run, with 38 percent supporting a potential runoff of him and 48 percent standing against it.
Other high-profile Democrat names that have been discussed to compete in 2020 include former vice president, Joe Biden, and the Vermont senator, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide in January, reported ‘Associated Press’.
Sarah Palin cites the disorder of the post-traumatic stress of Thrak Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being called into the army in September.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident
"What my son is going through, what he is experiencing after he has returned, can he connect with other families, which feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return to," she told participants at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans, "be coming slightly change, hardened, come thinking if they take the proper respect of soldiers and other aviators and members of the army, what they have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence after a woman’s attack, following a report of domestic violence and weapons, while she was intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Police Department at Wastella.
18 countries, D.C. support opposition to a new policy of asylum
Eighteen countries and the County of Columbia are supporting a legal objection to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims who have escaped criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the region filed an explanatory document as friends-of-court on Friday in Washington, in support of changing asylum-seeker policies, reports NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff on the Grace case against the Sessions that the American Union of Civil Liberties deposited in August against federal politics, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons gang members," abused her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
It was banned in Texas.
The state lawyers who are supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, as the countries that produce a high number of U.S. asylum applicants, because they are countries that have widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum-seeking policy restored a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed immigrants without documents to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
Colombian District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy " ignores decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all requests for asylum must be tried according to the facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure conflicts with this principle," was stated in the friend-of-court report.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the report that the detention by the police caused the entry of migrants damaged the American economy, saying that their chances are to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor force."
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to victims who escape domestic violence and violence from gangs.
"Azilli is available to those who leave their country because of their fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or affiliation to a certain social group or political conviction," said Sessions on June 11, on the day of the declaration of politics.
Asylum has never been thought to ease all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- with which people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Paul while the death balance doubles in a race to find the survivor
In survivors, the situation was extremely honorable.
"The situation feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while holding her little and sick son in an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palau.
"The ambulance brings troops every minute.
There is no clean water anymore."
Residents saw them return to their destroyed homes, extracting their depleted items in the water, in an effort to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 people are overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his back and shoulder, settled in the Military Hospital outside of Palusa, where patients are being treated in outdoor environments because land shocks continue still.
The eyes were filled with tears as he recalled when he felt the violent shock of the earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was crushed under the ruins of the wall," Haris told 'Associated Press', adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
I heard that the woman was crying and seeking help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of ‘harassment’ with ‘propagandaric ads’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page ad on a US day that propagated common U.S.-China trade benefits, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute its propaganda.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily’s ‘Des Moines Register’ premium - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after he accused China of interfering with the US Congress’ election held on November 6, a charge denied by China.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasing trade war which has seen the equalization of tariffs on each other’s imports.
Chinese and American experts have said China's repayment fees in this trade war were set to hit exporters in countries like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor for a long time to Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit US employees, farmers, and businesses.
In an opinion published in 'Des Moines Register' on Sunday Branstad wrote that, "China is already doubling this harassment by placing propaganda ads in our free press."
"Distributing its propaganda, China's government is helping with the commendable American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a charge ad on Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
In contrast, in the chaos of the newspapers on the streets here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese could have on China's concerning economic trajectory, since the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, he avoided offering to publish his article," despite not saying which newspaper was this.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating women voters before the election in the middle of the post-candal Kavaugh
As many as the main characters of the Republicans are solidarity and protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanough, before a few claims of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will face a severe reaction especially by women in the upcoming elections between the mandate.
Emotions about this topic have been too high, and many Republicans have publicly stated that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things cannot be dismantled," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University 'Maxwell' told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts in the last minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an investigation by the FBI and that this will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," the following day, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group 'MoveOn', according to Washington's newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang ‘November is coming!’ as they were demonstrating in the Sanitation corridors while the Republicans in control of the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with the Kamnaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimonies, the ‘Mic’ reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach the top," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People are saying it has already been at high levels; this is true.
But it may be even higher, especially among undecided women voters in the suburbs and among young voters, between the ages of 18 to 29, who, even though they do not like the president, do not usually vote at all."
Even before the Ford public testimony detailing her sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there would be a severe response if Republicans continued to support the run.
This has become a cobbled entangle for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to 'NBC News'.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed at the dock or not, it also concerns how Republicans have dealt with this issue and how they treated that woman," A Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorityes, a group that helps in the selection of Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat segregated on who to believe in the eve of the evidence of Ford and Kavanough, with the latter having a slightly higher support.
A recent poll from ‘YouGov’ shows that 41 percent of respondents undoubtedly or most likely believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they are undoubtedly or very likely to believe in the Kavanough.
Also, 38 percent think that Kavanough, very likely or obviously lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent say the same for Ford.
After the insistence of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating claims submitted by Ford as well as other accuser Deborah Ramirez reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee, under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was in a drunken condition.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court displayed his genitals before her while they were at a celebration while they studied at Yale, the 80s.
The creator of the worldwide network plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the worldwide network, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, ‘Inrupt,’ is a company that is built on the open source platform of Berners-Lee, called ‘Solid’.
Solid’ allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access a certain information.
In an exclusive interview for ‘Fast Company,’ Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind ‘Inrupt’ is “world domination.”
"We have to do it now," he told this innovative company.
"It's a historical moment."
The application uses solid technology to allow people to create "save their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, lists of things to do, music lists and other personal and professional tools.
It is just like having available on a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique about storing personal data on the network is the fact that it remains totally up to the user what kind of information it will access.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for the Inrupt, according to the company’s executive director, John Bruce, is to bring together the right resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to anyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on this project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google if they need to present a total change where all their business models are completely overturned at night.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a post on the published 'Medium' on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt Mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World-wide Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in network fairground debate.
Even while founding Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the global network consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this new age of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The award of the Victorian Cross during the First World War for the cleric
The only cleric who has won a Victorian Cross during the First World War in the quality of the warrior, has been commemorated in his hometown, 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, the honorable Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British military title.
A commemorative stone was introduced by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" for the commemoration to appear exactly 100 years of the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to ‘London Gazette’, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the channel of Saint-Quentin "through a dense fog and under the hail of bullets from the fields and machine guns."
He then rushed to the fire line and with a "great bravery" ran the battalion ahead and seized one of the weapons on the battlefield and the only one killed three people by opposing troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modestness."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, decided from a crown after the parade, which was led by the band ‘Brentwood Imperial Youth’.
Michael Vann said "feeling quite honorable that it was part of this parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is emerging from the support it is being given to by many."
MMA fans stayed all night smart to follow Bellator 206, but instead saw "Derrkuce Pepa"
Imagine, you stayed all night awake to see Bellator 206, and then you are deprived of the opportunity to see this main event.
The performance by San Jose contained 13 duels, including six fights in the base package, and would appear in real-time at night on channel 5, in the UK.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, while Gegard Moses and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, viewers in Britain were amazed when the transmission changed to display the Pepa Pigcence.
Some remained unsatisfied as they had stayed all night until the first hours, especially for this match.
A fan on Twitter described the move from the match in a child's cartoon as "an ugly joke."
"There are government rules that determine that at 6 o'clock in the morning that content was not appropriate and we had to move to a program for children," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications in Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Pepa Pig," yes."
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said they will work on the programming to include viewers from Britain in the future.
When I think of retransmit, I think we can solve it,” Coker said.
"But there is six o'clock in the morning, Sunday and we'll not be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our hour, that's their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed there were a lot of messages circulating and none of them was friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not, it was a government problem.
I promise you that it will not happen next time.
We will make the show with 5 matches instead of six - as we usually do - we tried to give more to fans and maybe we have exceeded the target.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘inferior’ about his sexuality
The Olympic diver, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but that gave him motivation to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he hadn’t understood until he went to school nine years old that “not everyone was like me.”
Speaking the first program on the Radio 4 of the ‘Dester Island Discs,’ presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised his voice on gay rights to give “hop” to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning an Olympic medal.
The permanent presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months of rest because it is sick.
Appearing as a person removed in the first program of Laverne, Daley said that while he grew up he felt "inferion" to others because "it was not socially acceptable for boys and girls."
He said, "To date, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt different, have been the real elements that gave me impetus and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was worth "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexual orientation.
Twice winner of the bronze Olympic medal, he is already a top-profile LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal more to countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said that he came out openly because he felt lucky enough to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world champion said the fall in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "caught me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said that the difference in age has never been a problem.
"When he experiences so many things at such a young age" he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said that it was difficult to find someone at the same age to have experienced the same downs and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you were to ask me last year, all I thought was ‘I have to win a gold medal’," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if we had ready tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first line.
I couldn't tell him, 'you won't be able to be in the first line,' he said.
"I held my hand as he breathed in the line and only after the line breathed and passed away for the first time that and he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of throughout my life - to dive in front of the local public in the Olympic Games, there was no more beautiful feeling," he said.
Also, this inspired his first musical selection - Proud by Heather Small - who accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and continues to cause the mornica.
The Desert Island Discs are awarded to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15, at the British time.
Mickelson, out shape, was left on the bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Fil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but will have to change his form to not turn this historic moment into disappointment.
Mickelson, for which is the 12th time he participates in this event, a record on his own, which is organized every two years, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk, during the double games (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being in the center of action, as it was usually for the United States, five times the winner of major titles, spent the day supporting the team and working with the hope that it will leave behind concerns.
Not among the players with the rightest shot even when he was at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not a player suitable for the complicated field of Le Golf National, where long and difficult areas do not leave room for wrong shooting.
And if not enough just the fear of the field, Mickelson, on Sunday, in the ninth match will face the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games this week.
If Americans, who have four points less, before the start of 12 single matches, will start hardships, the game of Mickelson may result decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, even though it cannot say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap in his arms, threw his hand on my neck and told me that it will be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
He has a lot of faith in himself.
He is at the Hall of Fame and he has given a lot of contribution to these teams in the past, and during this week.
I probably did not think that he would play two games.
I had thought more, but in the end it turned out and so we thought that it was the solution.
He wants to be on the field like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickey will pass Nick Faldo's record for the player with more appearances in Ryder Cup matches.
It can mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual appearances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
"He is cheerful, sarcastic, sharp, loves teasing people, and is a fantastic boy to have it in the team room," he explained.
“I also think that the younger players were having fun confronting him, this week, and that was nice to see.
He gives more than just a game."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn knows that the great head can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience, that the considerable lead they have before the last day of the single games in Ryder Cup, can be transformed into an unpleasant factor.
Danish made his debut in the 1997 face of Valderrama, where the team with captain Steve Balleros had a five-point lead against the Americans shut the tournament by winning a close margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had a major leadership in Valderrama; we had a major leadership in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with great difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed without a 5-3 victory in 'Class 2018' on Friday and yesterday to preside 10-12 at 'Le Golf National'.
So the story tells me and anyone in that team that it is not over.
Tomorrow we will walk with the last march.
We go there and do the right thing.
Nothing is over until we get the points on the chart.
We have one goal, try to win this trophy and here is our focus.
I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we have in front of - the best players in the world."
Enjoyed with the performance of his players, in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to hurry to this stage.
Tomorrow we will face another ‘monster’.
Tomorrow individual performances emerge, and that is something else to be done.
It’s fantastic when you’re on the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you’re alone, then you’re tested in full capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, tomorrow you need to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget the partner as he and he must go and give the best of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will hope that his players perform better individually than with partners, where the exception only does Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, to get three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has both experienced the great returnees of the result on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing to what is considered the "Macle in Medina" of the European team.
"I remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players during the last day, Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we must have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you take the flow to one side, put a lot of pressure on the middle match.
We put the formation based on this and we will draw the guys in the ranking we believe is the best, as you understand, we are trying to achieve a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of starting the score reversal and will face Rory McIlroy in the lead match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players who are positioned in the first half of the ranking
"I chose this group and in this rankings I believe it covers all the journey in the match," Bjorn said about his single selections.
The production of the new German warship is again postponed
The new German Navy had to have been sent in 2014 to replace the warships of the cold war, but will not be ready until at least the next year due to problematic systems and very high costs, local media reported.
The delivery of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new 'Baden-Wuerttemberg-class', has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper 'Die Zeit' citing a military spokesman.
The ship must join the Navy in 2014, but the problems after sending the ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007, will serve as replacements of the old ‘Bremen-class’ frigate.
As it is known, it will contain a powerful ball, a series of anti-aircraft and counter-sealth missiles and anti-sealth technology, such as reduction of radar detection, infrared and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to move the new frigates for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, ongoing delays imply that recent technological warships – which are said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad – will be obsolete at the time they will enter the service, writes ‘Die Zeit’.
F125’s “unfortunate” frigate came out on the first pages last year, when the German navy officially refused the order for this ship and turned it into the Blohm & Voss sea site in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina returned a ship to her builder after delivery.
They were given little information about the reasons for their return, but the media in Germany cited that they were a series of "major defects in software and hardware" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The problems in programming were particularly important on the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships because 120 sailors will be operated - how many half of the workforce of the old ‘Bremen class’ frigate.
It was also found that the ship was overweight, which reduced its yield and limited the ability of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons, is believed to be double the weight of ships of the similar category used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the troublesome physical parts, the price of the whole project - including crew training - is also returning to the problem.
It is said that it has reached a figure that leaves you speechless of 3.1 billion € (3,6 billion) - from € 2.2 billion that was originally forecast.
Problems that have gripped new frigates become particularly important after recent warnings that the German Navy’s power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chief of the defense committee in the German parliament, admitted that the Navy is "ending appropriate ships to move to another country."
The official said the problem had increased over time, because the old ships had been recovered from use but were not replaced with new ones.
He said regretably that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg-class new frigates would be able to join the Navy.
The National Trust Observes the Secret Life of the Night Nudity
A new search that is being developed by a company in the mountainous areas of Scotland, aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help future defense activities.
Study by scientists at the National Trust on Scotland will follow the usual batons and those called pitistrelles soprano as well as the brown ear and the Daubenton bats in Inverewe gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special registration equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
Analysis of the sounds that will be carried out by experts on all recordings will determine the frequency of the night naked sounds and what each species does.
Then, a report and a map of their habitat to give a detailed picture of their behavior will be drawn.
Rob Dewar, nature protection consultant for NTS, hopes that results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information would help determine the benefits of managing settlements, such as creating pastures and how to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of nightlies in Scotland and the UK has fallen sharply over the past century.
They are under the threat of construction and development work that influences nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as adhesive papers or chemical components of building materials, as well as domestic animal attacks.
In fact the bats are not blind.
However, due to their overnight hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing the prey.
They use a sophisticated location detection technique through sounds to accurately determine insects and obstacles during flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 acres of land in the country, deals very seriously with bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, nest inspections, and sometimes get involved in rescue programs.
Even the organization has set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to the bats in the Threes, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as home for eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The administrator of this reserve, David Thompson, says that this country is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in the Thrace we have an excellent area for the bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all the proper habitat.
But there are still many things about the bats that remain unknown, so the work we do here and in other countries will help us understand more what they need to ‘developed’.”
It emphasizes the importance of performing nightly nude controls prior to carrying out property maintenance works because there is the possibility that unintentional destruction of a nest can kill up to 400 female and young nightclubs thus exterminating the entire population of an area.
Nude of the night are protected and their killing, harassment, and concern or destruction of their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish employee at the Night Nude Conservation Trust, encourages people to become part of helping.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species, we just don't know how their population is shifting."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges for raping against him are "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German news magazine ‘Der Spiegel,’ which published these allegations.
Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas, in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he subsequently paid the $375 000 not to talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram, directed to its 142 million followers, just a few hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered the reports as "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What was said today, fake news," the Golden Ball won five times in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They want to become famous by saying my name, but this is part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue 'Der Spiegel' for these accusations, which they have called "unacceptable reports of suspicions of private life,".
Christian Schertz said that the player will ask for compensation for "moral damage to the value corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have happened in June 2009, in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to the documents presented in the District Court Clark, in Nevada, after meeting in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayora reportedly went to the player's room, where it is claimed that he raped her in the anus.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that "99 percent" he is a "good boy" left in the mud by "one percent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple has had sex but that he was with the acceptance of both parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an off-court solution because she was "terrified by revenge" and that she was concerned that she would "publicly embarrassed."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to return the deal because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer moved to Juventus' Italian giants in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK ‘will forever’ for losing car manufacturer status
The United Kingdom "will repent forever" if it will lose the status of world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota in the UK had said to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, society would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of the delays on the border, in the case of exit without agreement, would cost the loss of jobs.
Factory in Burnaston - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
In my opinion, in case Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s administrative director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW, said after Brexit will close for a month its Mini series factory.
Main concerns are related to what car manufacturers refer to as the risk of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works on "immediately ordered" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom cars.
If, on March 29, the UK comes out of the EU without an agreement, there may be delays in the border which according to this industry can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep in its factory in Derbyshire inventory of more than one day, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s ‘Chequers’ plan for future relations with the EU “is specifically built to avoid these border checks.”
We need an agreement, we want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment for too," he said for the Today program at the BBC Radio 4.
"Data, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must obviously be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long production would stop, but in the long term, warned that increased costs would reduce factory competitiveness and consequently lead to reduced jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the senior officer of Unite union in the factory, said that the members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience when these jobs close, they no longer return.
A government spokesman said, "We have set a precise and credible plan for our relationship with the future EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with general deputy prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "pushed for another week" as the fight for the Supreme Court’s candidate, Brett Kavanough, said on Sunday the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interventions in the election, the connections between Trump and Russia's assistant personnel, and the possibility that the president has hindered justice.
The discussion whether Trump will dismiss or not the deputy general prosecutor from office, thus putting into danger Mueller’s independence, is something that has been rumored for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein took into account the commissioning of a peeping to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president through amendment of 25.
Rosenstein denied this news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, among the reports that he was close to resign.
In contrast to what was expected, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would " prefer" not to dismiss Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the hearing held by the Senate's judicial committee, where they testified Kavanugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of obscene sexual behaviour.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanough, further pushing the full vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not yet scheduled a date, it can be this week, I think it can be postponed another week given everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But, let’s see, and I always like to keep the press up."
Some journalists may oppose this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
moderator Chris Wallace raised the question why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences did not come as a result of dissatisfaction with the attitude of television journalists," although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they attract attention."
Then, it hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president performs more sessions of quality assurance than any other president before him," she said, adding, without quoting data: "We have seen these figures."
There will continue to be press conferences, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, then this is many times better than to talk to me.
We try to do this frequently and you have seen it often done in recent weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions, or at press conferences with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president probably showed the reason for this fact, during this week in New York, where he made a controversial and in some strange cases, before journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to employees from the EU, at NHS Scotland, about the fear of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland, to express their gratitude in the name of the country and the desire to stay behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, deputy of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter when there are fewer than six months left from the UK’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover application costs for the status of a permanent residence for EU citizens working on public services at the local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the negotiations for the departure of the UK from the EU continued, approaching making a decision in the fall.
But the UK government has also intensified its preparations in the case of a scenario without agreement.
I know that this is a very troubling time for you all.
For this reason, I wanted to emphasize how much every member of staff contributes, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that increase and improve the work of health service, increasing the benefits of patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after damage suffered to the head
The center of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an immediate surgical intervention after injury on Saturday, 31-27 against Vanderbilt Comodores, the journalist of The Tennessee, Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State Rod Reed's manager told reporters that the damage occurred shortly before the first half.
"He came to the sidelines and fell there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombies oxygen on the sidelines before putting it on the stretcher and sending it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgical intervention at the Vanderbilt Hospital Center.
Harris added that "no detail on the type/scale of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to understand when the damage happened.
Abercrombie, second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He conducted five interventions on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing to 18 the total number of interventions during the season.

Treasury department expects to collect up to 120 million GBP annually to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that buyers with foreign nationalities will pay higher chicken taxes for the purchase of a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
This movement will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract new voters with promises to offer more affordable housing and “set targeted” people with high profits.
The stamp tax will be applied to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes to the UK, while the additional money will support the government’s initiative to fight the lack of housing.
This extra fee – which is added to the current stamp tax, including increased tax rate introduced two years ago for the second houses and for the properties purchased to be rented – can go up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts that this move will accumulate up to 120 million GBP per year.
About 13 percent of recently built properties in London are bought by people residing outside the UK, which causes price increases and makes it harder to find accommodation from buyers for the first time.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "pham cities" because of the high number of buyers with foreign nationalities who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for reducing the chicken tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms that they are holding high prices by buying land but without use, and called on Mrs. May to give up the quotas for affordable houses, in order to fix the "anticipation of Britain with properties."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed some attractive housing reforms, including rent control and removal of "without reason".
He also wants to give more power to counsel to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "I declared last year that I would dedicate the mandate of the prime minister to the British dream back - that is, for a better life for every new generation.
And this means regulating the problem market of homes.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign companies are simpler to buy homes than British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become very difficult to achieve and injustice to the homeless is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to at a certain stage become Scotland's coach.
Scottish, 42, is enjoying the challenge of resurgence of the north-eastern club, which currently resides in third place in League One (third category), three points from the head.
He came this summer to the Light Stadium after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I appeared once on the B representative and only that," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
But as a child, I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it’s something that has always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will only come if I am successful in running clubs."
Ross's predecessors in the running of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he is not concerned that he is following the steps of these big names in such a big club, as he has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my success will depend on whether 'could I turn this team into a Premier League?'
Given the structure and facilities of this club, it obviously has the place in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a simple task to go there, but I'll see myself successful only if I manage to get the club back to Premier League."
Ross has only three years since started her career as a coach after a period of assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the leading staff of Hearts.
He then helped the Allo to climb a category above up to the third round of the cup, and transformed St. Mirren from a club near the fall from the tier to the winners of the Championship next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a turning point," he says, about getting the direction of Alloa.
I really believed that training was the right thing for me, rather than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, I did a good life thanks to this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to experience a lot of things every week.
Again, I experience a lot of stress and pressure from work but training seems the right job.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like that, I've never been so well and so myself all over my life as an adult."

According to one study, the perfect time "to drink a beer" is Saturday 5:30 pm
The summer heat wave has increased local revenues in a difficult situation in Britain, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Data shows that sales in local groups and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July - but purchases in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, business consultant at CGA, who compiled the data, said: "The continuous sunny weather as well as England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected to follow July the same trend as June, where local sales grew by 2.8 percent, while restaurants recorded even higher decline.
I watched the restaurants fell 1.8% in June, and deteriorated further in July.
The bars and bars with the main activity of providing drinks record the best performance, with higher growth than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
Locals with main activity the food delivery also recognized as a result of sunny weather, although not as significant as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to come out for a drink.
Drink sales in bars and bars increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, a free-time analyst and hospitality at RSM, said: “These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the non-domestic market, the weather and the impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors.
No wonder the groups of restaurants continue to encounter difficulties, although a drop in sales by 4.8 percent a year will have a particularly serious burden considering the constant pressure of costs.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult moment for food operators and time will tell if the average temperatures of August will give the desired peace."
The total increase in sales in bars and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the brand launch.
The Confer Peach index of industry sales tracking, for the UK sector of bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with total turnovers of more than 9 billion GBP, and is the industry reference point.
One in five children have secret accounts in social media that hides their parents
According to one study, one in five children - some of whom not more than 11 years old - have hidden accounts in social media that hides parents and teachers.
A survey of 20 000 students of nine-year education showed rise in "fake Insta" profiles
This news has increased the fear of posts with sexual content
Twenty percent of students stated that they have a "main" account that they show to their parents
One in five children – some of whom not more than 11 years old – are opening social media accounts, which they use adults secretly.
A survey of 20 000 students of nine-year education showed rapid growth of "fake Insta" profiles related to the photo distribution page, Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a "primary" clean account that they show to their parents, but they also have a private account.
A mother, who discovered by chance her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, found that a teenager encouraged others to “rape her.”
The study of Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors ("Headmasters and Headsmistress" Conference - HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the age group 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC Head Mike Buchanan said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on board the Athletics in Scotland
Eilidh Doyle has been elected on board of Athletics in Scotland, in the post of non-executive director of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys massive respect in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely making that part of the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am enthusiastic that will serve as the voice of athletes and I very much hope that I will contribute and help in running sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre race at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and is a regular expert at the BBC, lost his ability to walk after a temporary ischemic shock.
He tweeted: "A month ago I suffered a blow.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time will they tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It took an exhaustive job but I managed to recover completely, learned again to walk and today I am doing skills!
Thanks for encouraging messages!"
The breast pump advertising that compares mothers to cows separates public opinion
A society for the production of breast pumps has shared public opinion with an ad that compares mothers who breastfeed with cow milking.
To launch the promotion of what is considered "the first water pump in the world without noise and which can be worn", the company of consumer technology products, Elvie, displayed a cheerful music video, to advertise the freedom this new mother pump that needs to be freely voiced.
Four real moms jump in a stall of grass-filled cows under the sounds of a song with the following text: "Yes, I milked myself, but I didn't have it" and "If you didn't see it, these are not sisi, it's my chest."
The refrain continues: "pumping, pumping, feeding believers, pumping, pumping, stinging ladies."
However, the ad, which is published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused online debate.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed feedback from viewers, with many of them expressing that they underestimated the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
Just like us they should remain "pregnant" and "born" to produce milk, just because their "babys" are taken from them a few days after they are born," someone wrote.
Elvie breast pump is placed inside the chips and does not stand out (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: " Clearly traumatic for the mother and for the child.
Why don’t we use them to advertise a sucking pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone added: "What ads without sensitivities."
Others supported the ad, among which a woman admitted that the song had appeared to her "laugh."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I would have bought one if you were still feeding your child.
The pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy but I saw what it means.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a cheerful advert addressed to mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or toilet) and who feel like "vant."
This is not an ad that assesses or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the female group shows that they have all danced with the "secret pump" set on the chips.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the data that many women using breast pump, say they feel that cows.
However, the Elvie pump is silent, no thread or tubes, placed inside the brace and does not stand out, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even step out while using it.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD (Executive Creative Director) at Mother commented: "Nivlis Pumps is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
Making a parallel between women who want to freely express themselves and dairy cows, we wanted to point out the use of breast pump and the challenges encountered, also showing in a fun and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the company Elvie comes out on the front page.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the pace of the designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border of Texas
The number of missing children has increased even though the monthly number of crossings to the border has remained relatively the same, partly due to the stringent rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have hampered the sending of children to their supporters.
Usually, most supporters have been themselves without documents, and have been afraid to risk their position in the country by attempting to apply for a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give their fingerprints, and they would be passed on to immigration authorities as well.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer from the Immigration Agency and Customs, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of people arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Around 80 percent of individuals who are supporters or family members of supporters remain illegally and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedents.
So, we are continuing to follow these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
According to housing workers, attempting to process children’s data faster, officials introduced new rules that require them to appear in court within a month of detention, and not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear before the immigration judge through video conferences and not physically, to argue their request for obtaining the legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be promptly deported.
According to housing workers and reports taken from the system in recent months, the longer the children stay forbidden, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more serious in larger places like Tornillo, where, due to size, they are more likely to bypass the signs that a child has difficulties.
They add that moving children to your city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends, it can cause traumas that many of them already face.
Syria urges US, French, and Turkish "conquer forces" to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has already entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, stated that foreign forces remain on the Syrian land illegally, under the pretext that they fight terrorism, and that "will act with them appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he declared during the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "illegal foreign forces."
The United States has around 2000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces that are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops in the territory of this country divided by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moulem said the conditions are good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "throwing irrational fear" for the refugees to stay away.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he said.
They are politicizing an issue, which should be entirely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer help to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to raise a neutral zone in the recent rebel stronghold in Idlib, has created the opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
The Russia-Turkey agreement avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in this province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem noted that the agreement had "clear guidelines" and expressed the belief that the military attacks would target jihadis, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related Nasura Front, who "will be exterminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moulem laid down the conditions for the government’s participation in this committee saying that the work of the panel should be limited “to the revision of the articles of the current constitution,” and warned of no interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Mandate
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many people with liberal views, accusations and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
In what would be undoubtedly "the most dramatic end of a presidency in history!"
So far, there are no signs of the tiredness of viewers.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during the peak time has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and has almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the peak time, from 1.7 million years ago, while the MSNBC program, "The Rachel Maddow Show", reached the top of the cash channel classification in the evenings.
"This is a fire to which people withdraw because it is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, head of the dramatic series at ABC "Designed Survivor," telling the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It brings to mind a taxi ride in Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver had told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why had she asked her.
He had replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There are fun values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can also join the health of the global economy.
Rinse is a luxury which can only withstand the most privileged viewers.
And yet, if you find yourself in six hours seeing a panel of experts debating the use of "uncertain information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's structural leather bomber jacket, worth 15 000 USD ("an arrogant dress," said The Washington Post) as well as the implications of the vivid descriptions of Stormy Daniels, for the anatomy of Mr. Trump, then it goes beyond being an informed citizen.
I will never see Super Mario again the same way.
"A part of what he does and makes it look like a 'reality show', is that it feeds you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars," about the actors that circulate and the daily unexpected developments of the Trump program (debate with N.F.L., praises for Kim Jong).
You cannot leave an episode without otherwise lag behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleis this week, the time was sunny and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was hidden inside, seeing MSNBC, while recording CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanaught would face the Senate Judicial Committee and the Supreme Court’s future hanging in thread.
"I remember realizing all those crazy programs in the past and the people who said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis told me.
"I thought it was a joke but it turned out they were right."

The money from outside the private sector floods in the narrow competition for the Congress elections
It is not surprising that the area 17 of Pennsylvania is facing a flood of money, as a result of the reorganization of the electoral areas that obliges two officials to compete for the same post.
This recently reorganization in the peripheral areas of Pittsburgh has established the democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won the post in another area, in the special elections, last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th area of Pennsylvania, to which the new 17th zone is overlapping.
This new division of maps came after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which, in January, said that the old areas were unconstitutionally and unjustly assigned in favor of the Republicans.
This competition, in the new area of 17, has promoted a strong confrontation in the financing of campaigns by key party financing bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congress Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March's special elections for the 18th electoral zone of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, he was held by Republicans and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 different points.
Political experts view democrats as light favors.
The US considers to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little impetus from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners drove the Trump Organization’s management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to remove American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of "last decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said the spokesperson of the department, Heather Nauert, during a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only reviewed by El Salvador, which received an aid of about 140 million USD from America, in 2017, including for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties that included reductions of financial assistance and certain restrictions on granting visas would be heavy for the Central American country and for its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings reached progress, North and Central American officials pushed a high-level conference with a focus on economic security and well-being to follow a similar meeting last year, an action that was considered step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that the conference was taking place, ending any possibility of imposing penalties on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has planned to give a speech at the conference, which is envisaged in mid-October, a signal that indicates the importance of the administration to this meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly from El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak of internal discussions, provided that their anonymity was maintained.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst at the administration, who also spoke, seeking the right to anonymity.
Study history
The next event expected to happen could be the report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller for possible obstruction by Mr. Trump, for which there is significant evidence in public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is shifting his investigation into whether during his campaign, Mr. Trump has collaborated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes its arm, Mr. Trump will have to account before this body, at a time when he prepares to stand up to the voters again, and perhaps he may face an independent jury.
These are many if, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump - or that of his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, must make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to cast a coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted and would support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed further.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which accelerate or delay the unstoppable path of democracy.
Currently, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump unloads Rod Rosenstein's deputy general prosecutor, the man controlling the fates of the investigation against Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein was not in a difficult situation since this newspaper reported, during the past year, that he had suggested to wiretap the president secretly, as well as speculated that he was not suitable to stay in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times's article is not correct.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite allegations based on sexual attacks and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the upcoming elections for a Congress that will consider responsible Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But, I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime who conquered the residence of ambassadors where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table that holds the swastika symbol (broken cross).
Having this heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers player, Graham Dorans is optimistic ahead of the confrontation with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers await Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory against the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain in front of Villarreal, earlier this month, would place them in a favorable position to qualify for the G group of the Europa League.
A knee injury did not allow the midfielder Graham Dorrans to make the first appearance this season in a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers could use that result as inducement to achieve greater things.
It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We entered the field believing that we could get something and went out with one point.
Maybe we could have scored in the end but, in general, I believe that equalization was a fair result.
Maybe they were better in the first half as we showed up in the second part and we were the best team.
On Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
I hope that we will be able to get three points but it will be a tough match because they achieved a positive result in their past match, but, with fans who support us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to suffered injuries and changes in the club but now there is a factor of optimism in this team.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying it a lot; the training goes well.
I hope we can move forward, throw last season on our backs and succeed."
Females sleep less as a result of fear for retirement savings
Despite the fact that participants in the study had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to take care of them, very few people talked to them about it.
About half of individuals in Valbona’s study said they spoke to their husbands about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent responded that they spoke to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of society for ensuring life, Nationwide.
Here's where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you first show your wishes.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how to take care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial advisor too: The advisor can help you find a way to pay for expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, life insurance policy with savings to help cover these costs or self-insurance through your assets – as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorization.
Take a health care proxy and set a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also, consider getting a proxy for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and guarantee paying bills if you can’t do anything like that yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and medications you receive?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you are ready.
"It's not only in the game financial aspect, but also who are doctors?" Martin asked.
"What drugs will be used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
A person is shot several times with air rifles at Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he went home after spending the evening outside.
The victim, about 40, was located in the Oxford Grove area, at Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot at the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers stated that this was a "case act", which happened around 02:30 BST.
The victim did not see the aggressor.
The injuries received do not pose a danger to life, and the police are seeking witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Friday the Indonesian city of Palau, declared officials while the death number is expected to increase.
With out-of-function communication networks, support workers have not managed to get information from Donggala's regency, a northern area of the Palu, which was closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicenter.
In Palau, more than 16 000 people have been evacuated after this disaster.
Below you have some facts about Paul and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palau is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with population of approximately 379 800 inhabitants, in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency extending to more than 300 km (180 miles) coastline northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population estimated about 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and livestock are the main economic activities of the province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in the Morowali, on the other side of the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Agency for Disaster Mitigation in Indonesia, Palau and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunami over the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami took his life more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, causing nine victims.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area of the Fire Ring in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and cans of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 states, causing 226 000 casualties along the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half lived in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's western coast at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on the island of Nis Island, on the bank of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that crashed on the south coast and took life of about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 in the vicinity of the city of Padang, the capital of the province of western Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh, bringing destruction and panic to people after recalling the destruction caused by the earthquake and deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives from building collapse.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, taking life more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and candidate for president, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report submitted on Saturday by the state police of Alaska, Palin, 29, by Waslla, Alaska, was arrested as suspected of domestic violence, for preventing the reporting of domestic violence and for opposing the arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman, his acquaintance, tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took the phone.
Paul is being held in the Mat-Su detention facility and is being held a guarantee in the form of an unpaid bills worth $500, KTUU reported.
According to the reports of this network, he appeared in the court on Saturday and when asked about the admission of the guilt, he stated that "it is absolutely innocent".
Paul faces three violations of category A, meaning that he can be imprisoned for up to one year and fined at $250 000.
Also, he has been accused of a violation of category B, which is sentenced to a day in prison and $2000 fine.
It is not the first time criminal charges filed against Paul.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This issue is currently being reviewed by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting and indecent possession of weapons during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her on his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of the service in Iraq.

The 7.5-faced earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are out of service, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the central part of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On social media there are videos that show the moment of the blow.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palau when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for terror attack suspect in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York but seek death penalty for Sayfulo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, is supposed to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a terrorist attack on a bike route along the western highway, in the lower Manhattan, footing and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has killed eight victims and caused severe bodily injuries "with premeditation", according to the letter the purpose to ask for the death penalty, filed in the southern county of New York.
According to a court document, for both of these charges a death penalty may be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury put Saipov in front of 22 lawsuits, including eight charges of murdering organized crime, often used by prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
This attack came as a result of "a significant and deliberate planning," prosecutors expressed, describing the manner of execution of crime by Saipov as "unverse, cruel and without moral."
Sayfullo Habiblaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hermann Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnacco," written in the letter of purpose.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last time when the southern county of New York prosecuted a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug providers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time when the death sentence was used on a federal matter in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of committing conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
They were both executed in the electric chair, on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, with an uzbeksian nationality, did not show remorse during the days and months after the attack.
He stated in front of the investigators that he feels good for what he has done, the police reported.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after ISIS’ video on his mobile phone.
The police stated that he had also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He stated that he is innocent of 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "very disappointed with the prosecution’s decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accepting guilt accompanied by life imprisonment without appeal will further increase the trauma caused by these events to all persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for death sentences.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed at the top of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today, during a protest at the conference of the Conservatives, that it will 'mobilize the army of the people'.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should 'feel the pressure' of Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May deputies suggested he should be at the top of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would 'be off' if the Brexit secretary were Mr. Farage.
However, the challenge that Mrs. May faces in order to unite her group was noted by pro-conservatives in the EU, who joined another protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is facing difficulties in the implementation of the compromise plan reached in Chequers, among the attacks that come from those wishing the stay or departure from the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite fierce reactions - and will force Eurosceptics and lubricants to choose between its package and chaos.'
During the March The leave means leave, Mr. Bone stated that she wants to abandon the Chequers agreement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be put in charge and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he were in charge, now we would be outside," he said.
The deputy of Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brexit but we must abandon the agreement of Chequers.'
Expressing his position against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to draft our laws on our site.'
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.'
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also at the march and said about journalists: 'I just want to say: the Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The 'Chequers' agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote it, it is not supported either within our party and by activists who fill the streets and vote us.
Please, abandon the Chequers and start hearing.'
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: 'The Prime Ministers keep their jobs in cases when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage said during the march that politicians should 'feel pressure' if they are thinking of abandoning the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is an issue related to the trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say 'we won't let you do that.'
During a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to force our political class, which is near Brexit’s abandonment, to feel the pressure.
'We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the UK is independent, proud, and self-government.'
Meanwhile, they marched to Birmingham before holding a gathering that lasted two hours in the city center.
A small group of activists held banners reading Conservatives against Brexit, following the screening of this group at the weekend.
The Labour Support Lord Adonis ironed with the conservatives about the problems they had with a "social application", during the launch of the conference.
These are the people who tell us that they can prepare IT systems and technology necessary for "Canada plus", for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
'It's totally a farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to “observely examine” the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that he will "providely "examine the possibility of running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the democratic senator of Massachusetts talked about her future during a meeting in the municipality, held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, is running to be re-elected in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Trump campaign in 2016, in Massachusetts.
She was at the heart of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting organized on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the voters according to the municipal format, from the time Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for Presidents.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington and regulate the broken government, and that includes putting a woman at the top."
A person is arrested for killing the player of the LSU team, Wayde Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that he has arrested a suspect in the killing of basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested around 11 am, announced police department at Baton Rouge, through a media conference.
The police had published a video of the shootings on Friday, where they sought help to identify the person who appeared there.
Sims, 20, was shot with a firearm and killed near the South University campus during Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims passed away as a result of gunshot wounds inflicted on his head," Police chief Murphy J. Paul stated on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to be on the scene, carried weapons, and that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to custody at the police department in the eastern Baton Rouge area.

Russia's big prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's instructions give victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Walter Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team guidelines would play a significant role in the competition.
Bottas left the first place and almost "punished" Hamilton after defending his position on the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop and left Hamilton to compete in "traffic" at the end of the car stack, something that had to be decisive.
Mercedes stopped a ride later and positioned behind Vettel, but Hamilton went on top of a number of maneuvers forced Ferrari's pilot to leave space inside behind a dual move to defend itself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race from the final line and at the end of the first round the seventh round, on his 21st birthday.
He was then on top in a large part of the race as he did not change the tyres to achieve a quick finish and passed Kimi Rakkonen ranking the fourth.
Eventually, he stopped in the 44th lap but did not manage to improve the pace in the remaining eight laps by releasing the fourth place to Raikkonen.
It is a difficult day because Walter did a fantastic job all the weekend and was told a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job with these positions,” Hamilton said.
Very poor use of body language
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Diane Feinstein during a Saturday rally, regarding her insistence, that it was not the person who "brought out" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanugh, of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by the Ford in front of the Senate Judicial Committee, but said that what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "lawful, bad and unsatisfactory."
"The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what is happening in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at anger, when you look at people who are angry, wicked, bad and unsatisfactory," he said.
When you look at the published publications secretly and then the people who say "oh, I have not done it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you who discovered the paper?
Remember its answer... have you issued the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't take it out."
Wait a minute.
We didn’t bring it...No, we didn’t get it,” he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent letters with the details of the charges against Kavanough from Ford and the document was released earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I did not hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I did not extract her story in the square," Feinstein told the commission, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it such as she asked me."
But it seems that her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during Saturday night’s debate: “For my opinion, gestures really left to be desired.
Maybe he didn't, but I never saw weaker gestures before."
By defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused by three women of obscene sexual behavior, the president said that the Democrats are using alleged charges in order to achieve their goals.
They are determined to regain power at all costs.
They don’t care who they harm, who they have to go under to take power and control,” reported Media as the president’s words.

Dundee Stars compensated the suffered loss on Friday against Belfast Giants, in the valuable challenge to the Elite League, winning the return match on Saturday with a result of 5-3, in Dundee.
The Giants quickly switched to double-advantage thanks to Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Beauvilleri's knocks.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the score for the local team before Dwyer returned the Giants to the advantage.
Francois Bouchard equated to Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
This was the third loss of the season, in the Elite League, for Adam Keefe's trustees, who Friday evening returned from the disadvantage, to defeat Dundee 2-1, in Belfast.

Air traffic controller loses life by making sure that hundreds of people on a plane escape the earthquake
An aerial traffic test, in Indonesia, is being honoured as a hero after losing his life, making sure a plane held hundreds of people, landed safely.
Over 800 people lost their lives and many others have been declared lost after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area and many have been stuck in ruins in the city of Palau.
But despite his colleagues being fled to escape, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Angu refused to leave his post at the control tower that was swinging at the Paulía Airport “Mutara Sis Al Jufri Airport”.
He stood to make sure that the 6321 flight aircraft of the Batik Air, which was on the track at that moment, could go safe.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought that it was being demolished.
He lost his life later in the hospital.
The spokesman of "Air Navigation Indonesia", Yohannes Syria, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported "ABC News" of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he lost his life today in the morning, before the helicopter arrives at Palau.
"This news cuts our soul apart," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands of people, while the local agency for mitigating the consequences of disasters says that the entrance to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that this number will continue to grow, as there were still many bodies under the rubble, while others are not found," said the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves that reached up to six meters have destroyed the Paluna, where on Friday will be held a massive funeral ceremony.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing supplies and aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said for “Sky News”: “Every minute ambulance brings troops.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said for CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived on Sunday in Palau and addressed the country's army: "I'm asking you to work day and night to perform every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
The plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says that a person lost after a plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline running a plane crashing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now announced a missing person, having previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were evacuated from the aircraft that was sinking into the water.
In a press release, "Air Niugini" said that on Saturday afternoon they were not finding a passenger.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an attempt to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boat helped to save passengers and crew after the plane crashed into water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were escorted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of collision and the consequences of events remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon after it did not reach the track.
Some witnesses thought the plane went through the track.
US Passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"This is an extremely good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that through water that had reached the waist level, he and other people managed to reach the exits of the aircraft emergency.
He said the stewardesss were in panic and were yelling while he suffered a slight head injury.
The US Navy said sailors working to repair a nearby scaffolding helped save them, using an air boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sinks to about 30 metres (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Security Network show that 111 people have lost their lives in clashes of airlines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but “Air Niugini” was not included in any of them.
The analyst builds night chronology when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its arguments in a person’s retrial, which is accused of alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours, in the capacity of the expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used the phone data to rebuild the movements of the defendant, the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night the latter passed away.
According to The Clarion Ledger's reports, Rowlett stated that he received the location data from some mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers the afternoon of her death, a fact that refutes his previous claims.
When the data revealed that his mobile was in the same place as that of the Chambers while he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the Police went to speak to the latter.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that on that day he was not in the city.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tells was telling the truth when he declared that he was in the Sanford truck that evening, the latter said that "he is lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is Tellis’s statement, which said he had known the Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Telephone signs showed that they had only one week they knew each other.
Rowlett said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis had deleted messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The protective party is scheduled to give the closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge stated that the jury will make the decision the same day.

Another colored man?!
The dadoja from New York accused the couple of leaving work after receiving the message "racist"
A New York nanny has sued a couple for discrimination in dismissal, after receiving a message sent wrong by a mother, which complains that she was "another colored man."
The couple has denied they are racists, considering the lawsuit as "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her concern when she discovered that young Dada Giselle Maurice was a black woman, at the moment she appeared on the first day of work, in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOO, Another one of Coloured," she wrote to Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her own boner, Plasco-Flaxman, "listening in embarrassment", was fired by Mrs. Maurice, on the grounds that their current nanny, which was African-American, had done a weak job and that instead, she wanted a filipina.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her only day of work and then taken home with a "pocket" from her pocket.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for leaving work, and is seeking compensation in the amount of $350 a day for a six-month period, for which she was taken to work, even though without a contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do such things," she stated on Friday for The Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied the allegations that they were racists, saying that the removal of Maurice was the right action, as they were afraid that they could no longer believe him after they had insulted him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racist," the husband Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But will you leave the children in the hands of a person you are rude to, even if you are wrong?
Your newborn child?
Tell me."
Considering the lawsuit as "expulsion," Plasco said he and his wife had brought to life a child, two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you take revenge on someone in this situation?
It’s not a positive thing to do,” Plasco, investment banker, added.
While the case has gone to court, the public has quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticising their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows Paddington's publishers feared readers would not create connections with a gold that speaks
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the receipt of the book, said about this letter: "It is difficult to put herself in the place of a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
We feel a great pleasure now that we have seen the remarkable success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman, before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the book for children, would have been sad if his work would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, last year after his death, contained "sweeping and happiness".
As for Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of success.
He was a quiet person and he did not boast,” she said.
Paddington was so true to her that it was like having a child succeeding: you feel proud of him even though it is not exactly your success.
I think that’s how he saw Paddington’s success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the merits himself to the character of Paddington."
My daughter was life changing and I was forced to say goodbye to her by phone
Upon arrival, her daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nis, where doctors had tried to save their lives without result.
Nad regularly called me to tell me that it was very heavy, that he did not believe that he would succeed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got a call from Nad who told me that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, “Now, I love you very heart.
We will be together soon.
We will be together.
Medications that her doctors had given her to keep her heart at work are losing the effect and are slowly leaving her system.
She had died some time ago and now everything was going "offened".
I was forced to sit and wait, knowing that it was happening.
I could not mourn or shout because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I had to be strong."
Over time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, lamenting the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers - who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down and at all the time tears flowed.
It is difficult to explain, but during that flight I felt a great regret for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved it."
Women holding black mail letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters with inspiring messages on a bridge in Wales as well as phone numbers of people who can call them for support.
Mrs. Davis’s son was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a “sticky” smile.
"They all knew him about his smile.
People always said that his smile brightens every room."
However, he relinquished work before he passed away, as he was "at a truly dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who at that time was 11, was the person who found his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I constantly care that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters, "for people to know that there are people who can help him and with whom they can talk, even with a friend.
Do not sit alone - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
He did not say that he felt upset, depressed, or something else," she said.
"Some days before Christmas we notice the difference in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he did not look at them and did not do any action."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they must overcome: "It is something that destroys the whole family.
We destroyed us.
But we all have to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanough’s future depends on thread after the start of the investigation by the FBI
"I thought we could give something similar to what it required – a limited investigation in time and facility – we could probably bring some harmony," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "comparing" amid numerous obstacles of opponents.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanough and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their hesitation comes all as a result of time.
The elections for the Congress are only 5 weeks away, on November 6 - if the Republicans come out badly, as they are expected, they will greatly weaken in the efforts to choose the person they want in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has called the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanough, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him became acquainted with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
It will be voted on in the senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanough could gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to end this situation and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea falls under the leadership of Kim
The number of deserters in North Korea has declined since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has declared.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Union in South Korea, stated that there were around 1127 deserts last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the main factors were the strictest checks on the borders between North Korea and China as well as the highest tariffs required by human traffickers.
Penian has not made public comments.
Most deserters from North Korea receive citizenship from South Korea.
Seoul declared that more than 30 000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them leave China, which has the highest length of the border with North Korea and can be passed there more simply compared to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected by numerous forces.
China considers illegal immigrants not as refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still in war - have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penian and their talks focused on late negotiations for de-clearization.
This meeting came after the historic meeting of June, between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress until that moment.
Without trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we, unilaterally, disarm the first," said Mr. Ri during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaught "hysterical," and says he is not worthy to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the appointment of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanough a “hysterical” and said that due to his temper, he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments on Saturday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival, in Austin, Texas.
"I can not think that if a woman had ever been brought like that, people would say 'hysterical,' Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony of Kavanaught in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaught denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they both were teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanough was very worried and at some moments almost yelled or "remembered" when he talked about his family and about the years of high school.
He accused Democrats explicitly before the committee, calling charges against him as “a grotesque and coordinated assassination of his figure”, organized by the liberals infuriated by Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh’s testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as she showed his prejudice on Democrats.
I think he penalized himself with those statements and the way Clintons and Democrats attacked it,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated to answer the question whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of disbelief in case of his appointment, and in case the Democrats win most seats in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he is not telling the truth before the Congress or the FBI, then he is unqualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now", said Pelosi.
The Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the decisions of Kavanough against the Affordable Care Act or about the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings for his appointment, Kavanough was shunned by questions if certain decisions of the Supreme Court were to be repealed.
"It's not time for a historical and biased person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say "how well!" Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
This is a just verbal attack, months and years of anger that explodes, and it fails to bring to the end without crying.
We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. Yes you?"
She continued, "It helped me a lot of a woman who worked in a leading position, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but had invented a style that every time she was angry and started crying, to the interlocutors, "I could think I'm upset and so I'm crying.
But I am actually angry."
And then she continued to speak.
And I thought this was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way to express the heart, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men prevailed and where I found myself crying out of irresistible anger, was the moment when a larger woman took me by the throat - a cold manager which I have always had somewhat fear - pushed me towards the stairs.
Never let others see you crying,” she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you are bored and they will be glad they managed to annoy you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a Democratic member of the Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his candidacy for President.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found among an extra-marital relationship on board a boat named “Monkey Business” and was pulled out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, realized that he had no reason not to run for himself for presidents.
This was not a well-weighted decision,” she told me laughing, 30 years later.
In the competition there were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was a more candidate.
Someone called it “Snow White and the Seven Midgets”.
Since the campaign was in its final stages, it remained behind with the fundraising, so it pledged that it would not compete if it failed to collect $2 million.
But it was an in vain war.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave her 1000$ male, she was given only 250$.
Do not think that they make me a reduction?” she wondered.
During the speech that she announced that an official campaign would not take place, she was so overcrowded with emotions — acknowledging the people who supported her, angering the system that made it so hard for collecting money and targeting voters instead of delegates, and anger with sexism — that she drowned.
It seemed as if I had undergone a nerve crisis,” Mrs. Schroeder reminded of the way the press reacted to it.
It seemed like Kleenex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember what people would write in my tombstone?
She cried?”
Advantages of the US-China trade war on Beijing
The first bursts of trade between the U.S. and China were deafening, while the war is far from over, a break between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, setting taxes on leading Chinese export goods, including solar, steel, and aluminum panels.
The most significant escalation was the one that happened this week, when new tariffs affected goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing is every "outside" revenge, most recently setting tariffs from five to ten percent over $60 billion in US goods.
China has vowed to return the U.S. to the same currency, and the world’s second-largest economic power is unlikely to be delivered soon.
The removal of measures from Washington means surrendering in front of their demands, but to China's president Xi Jinping, would be too embarrassing to publicly bow down to the US.
However, experts stated that if China plays its letters properly, the pressures coming from the US trade war could positively support China in the long term to reduce the interoperability of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, swiftly made in Washington and Beijing, can cause economic downturn in each of these countries, is much more dangerous than what has been seen from abroad," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the research center for the new American security, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, to restore normal life.
Now, there are all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to their country, from where you had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that hit their daily lives and well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5,5 million Syrians left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
About six million others still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the country will not accept assistance or conditional assistance from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the "Ryder Cup", in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 trophy after defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 with 10.5, at the Le Golf National, to the exit of Paris, France.
The US has already lost 6 consecutive games on European territory and has since 1993 to win this trophy in Europe.
Europe recaptured its crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team managed to get 14.5 points he needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was the player who encountered more difficulties during the tour, took the first blow in the water and closed the 16th pit with 3 shots more than the level assigned, losing the match in front of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players who have achieved 5-0, since the current format was applied, in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth beats 5&4 of the lowest ranking player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to English Ian Poulter, who may have played in his final final final of Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who played in eight Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player of all time in this tournament, with 25.5 points in her career.
"Usually, I don't cry but today I can't keep myself.
It has been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m very, very happy to recapture the cup.
The success is the team, and I am happy that I had the opportunity to help them," said Garcia quite excited after the victory of the European team.
He passed his word to his compatriots, John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend, Tiger Woods, on the direct challenges, on Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up seeing that player," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods missed all of his games in France and now has 13-21-3 statistics, during his career in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranking second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team encountered difficulties throughout the weekend to take the ball to the right place, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing appearance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys. They fought hard.
There were several moments during this morning when we pressured the European team.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
His 12 players played quite well.
We will be regrouping, working with PGA in America as well as with our Ryder Cup committee and going forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be the captain.
We have to " remove the hat".
They played better than us."
