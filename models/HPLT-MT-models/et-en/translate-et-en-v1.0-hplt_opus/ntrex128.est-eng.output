Members of the National Assembly of Wales are afraid to look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have been amazed by the suggestion to change their position to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The theme has started with the plan to change the name of the National Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
One of the members of the National Assembly of Labour said that his group members were concerned because it rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp.
To explain to readers outside Wales: the Welsh word daft means sluggish and pwp means scum.
A member of the record said that the whole group was “not happy” and had proposed other names.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party said that his group was “receptive” to name change, but noted that the word “MWP” is very similar to the word “Muppet”.
For clarification: In Welsh, the pronunciation of the letter w is similar to that of Yorkshire's English U.S. pronunciation.
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently drawing up a draft law on the change of name, said: “The final decision on all the names by which members of the National Assembly are invited will of course be taken by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government’s 2017 law gave the National Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey on the proposals, on the basis of which the idea of renaming the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament is widely supported.
With regard to the role of members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Wales Members of Parliament, or WMP’, but the public survey participants were most in favour of the MWP option.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other titles, but reaching an agreement may prove a challenge to President Elin Jones, who should present a draft amendment in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the deprivation of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee system.
The final vote on the nomination of the members of the National Assembly will remain in the legislative debate with the members themselves.
The Macedonians are holding a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country as the ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
A referendum will be held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim on this territory and has repeatedly objected to membership in the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov, against the referendum on the name change, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue, however, that name change is only a price that the state would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's watches are silent because the Harlem churches are struggling
The older people I have talked to have said that there was a bar and a church at every corner in the old days,” said Mr Adams.
There is no longer either.
He said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
People communicate differently today,” he said.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhood where people are daily.
However, as regards churches, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and that they will be back at the beginning sooner or later.
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people who do not reach the rest of the churches of the neighbourhood with a helping hand.
The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who will therefore speed up the day when all these churches close their doors, as it is unlikely that most of the people who settle here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became the Metropolitan Community in 1870, the Church of Saint Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The Black Church, which had worshiped God in the vicinity so far, took over the ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was seized by the African American congregation, led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against 125th Street shopkeepers on Harlem's main shopping street, when they refused to hire or promote the Christians.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when members of the father's Johnson congregation planned to restore the building, they introduced a carillon or bell-game.
Father Johnson's son and heir to St Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly named the carillon "the bells of the poor".
However, in July, an expert who played the carillon gave it a second name: ‘cultural value’ and ‘an indispensable historical tool’.
The expert from the University of Tiffany Ng Michigan also noted that it was the world's first carillon played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play the larger carillon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What has been played in St. Martin's Church in recent months has been the story of architects and contractors, some of whom have involved the secular leaders of the church, others the diocese.
In July, the administration of the church, or the governing body of a congregation made up of secular leaders, complained in writing to the Bishopric that the Bishopric ‘will try to pass on the costs’, although the Presidency was not even involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the Bishopric.
Some members of the association complained about the poor transparency of the diocese's actions.
In California, the shark injured a 13-year-old boy diving after lobsters
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived for lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in Encinitas near Beacon’s Beach.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help and then swam in to help him pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for receiving the lobster, but “he understood then that the boy yelled, “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
The entire clavicle of him had been stripped,” Hammel described the vision he saw when he arrived at the boy.
I called upon everyone to come out of the water: “There is a shark in the water!”, added Hammel.
A boy in a life-threatening condition was taken by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The attacking shark species is still unknown.
The lifeguard and Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was established that they were not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were at the top of the body.
For research and safety purposes, the authorities closed access to the Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, from Casablad to Swamin.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Saintsbury's plans to take over the UK beauty market
At Sainsbury, Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams are taking over the chain, creating supermarket-like beauty aisles, which also employ expert advisors.
As part of the significant penetration of the UK’s £2.7 billion beauty market, which continues to increase as fashion and household goods sales decline, wider lines of beauty products will be tested in 11 shops all over the country, taking them into use in other shops next year if successful.
Beauty products are invested because supermarkets are looking for ways to take advantage of the shelf space previously allocated to TVs, microwaves and household goods.
At Saintsbury, he said that he was planning to double his range of beauty products up to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also given more space in branded areas, as is currently the case in Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-launch its range of make-up products, Boutique, where most of the products are suitable for vegans, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, is testing exclusive marketing authorisations in two shops in Saintsbury, the first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one opened this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and switching to daily purchases of small quantities of food from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, has said that sales outlets are becoming increasingly similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to combat low-cost chains such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and manufactured goods.
The same has been done with Habitat's outlets, as both chains were bought in Saintbury two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food products and made the acquisitions more profitable.
Supermarket's previous attempt to upgrade its beauty and treatment departments ended with a failure.
Sainsbury tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended with a dispute about how to share the proceeds of the sale of pharmaceutical goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after the sale of 281 sons of Saint Petersburg to Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for a three-year period.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxury skin care products, including from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the range of its four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Business Manager at Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty aisles to improve the surrounding environment for our customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained staff who are always ready to advise.
Our brand selection meets every need. The attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive beauty trade destination, which can change old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million deal
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones left “furious” when the TV director, Holly Willoughby, gave up a £11 million deal in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby lacks time for the household goods and clothing brand Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old director of the TV show “This Morning” announced his departure at Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star inside Peter Jones' anger by stepping out of their luxurious lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said that Jones was “furious” when a television star girl admitted at a stressful meeting on Tuesday at the business empire headquarters in Marlows Buckinghamshire that her new contracts worth £1.5 million mean that she no longer has enough time to devote herself to the homewear and clothing brand Truly.
The business has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million worth.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly certainly was the main preference of Holly.
This was intended to secure his long-term future, so the woman thought she was involved in it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything involved completely puzzled.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to marketing the product line.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods.”
Experts believe that the departure of the leader of this Morning, one of the UK’s most popular fames, can cost the company millions, because products with a choice ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and homewear have invested a hefty amount of money, as well as the subsequent launch of the product.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as Chairman in March.
Couples go on holiday together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's teleproduction company.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin in the I’m A Celebrity TV series of I’m ITV.
One of Jones' close sources last night said: “I don’t want to comment on his business.”
Hard talk, “after what we fell in love”
Trump was joking about the criticism of the news for a comment that some consider to be ‘unworthy of the President’ and over-positive towards the North Korean head of state.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his taunting “news anchor voice”:
I have not given up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the withdrawal of North Korean nuclear weapons.
However, the negotiations for the withdrawal of nuclear weapons have been halted.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the “corresponding reaction” of the United States to the initial steps in North Korea.
Instead, he noted that the U.S. would continue the country with repressive restrictions in the future.
The point of view of Trump’s exhortation speech was much more joyful.
We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
North Korea was at war.
Millions of people would have died.
Now everything is very well between us.”
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought good results: he had completed rocket attempts, helped to free hostages, and had arranged for the relics of American officials to be brought home.
He also defended his unusual communication with Kim.
It is very easy to be president, but instead of letting 10 000 people wait outside to get to this stuffed stadium, it is better if we have nearly 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the island of Indonesia by killing hundreds of people
In order to eliminate the consequences of the Lombard earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than ten percent of the population of Lombok had to be relocated, the national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international aid, so things are a little complicated,” said Mrs Sumbung.
While Save the Children puts together a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Palu in order to decide whether international authorities would be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly little prepared to deal with natural forces.
Although shelters from the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are not very common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given about the tsunami, the apparent absence of the siren of the tsunami warning probably increased the number of deaths.
Travelling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is also quite challenging at the best times.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics there.
The hospital ship that stopped treating the victims of the earthquake in Lombok will head to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new site of the accident.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's divided infrastructure a central part of his election campaign and has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, Mr Joko's government is in danger of budget deficits, as next year there will be new elections.
Mr Jokot is also putting pressure on the tensions in Indonesia among the kinders, where most members of the Muslim community have turned to a more old-fashioned form of faith.
More than 1000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes due to the battles between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets, where machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons were used.
Watch: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge kicks a tie in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's defeat in Chelsea's Premier League, drawing a stand at a Saturday game in Stamford Bridge, London, for the 89th minute of the game.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 metres from the Chelsea Gate, when his team was in command at 1:0.
He hit the ball to the left before he hit it in the direction of the far-away pole.
The ball flew high across the penalty area and hit the upper right corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizaba and fell into the net.
I just tried to get into position, access the ball, and players like Shaq would pass on the ball as much as possible, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for myself,” said Sturridge on LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kant coming, I made a touch, and I made a blow without thinking for a while.”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea 1:0 led the Belgian star Eden Hazard on 25 minutes of play.
The Blues attacker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovac in this game before he turned around on the central square and hit Liverpool.
Kovacic gave a quick pass in the midfield.
Then he created a beautiful air meal, leading Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard passed the defense and slammed the ball with his left foot in a net in the direction of a post far from the Liverpool player, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays with Naples in the Champions League subgroup on Wednesday at 15.00 in Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA EuroLeague game on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, said the National Disaster Agency on Sunday morning.
A number of people were trapped in the wreckage of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and brought along the 18-metre giant waves, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson of the Agency, at the press conference.
With more than 380 000 inhabitants, the town of Palu was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a suspected 32-year-old man after stabping a woman to death
The murder investigation began this morning after finding the body of a woman in Merseyside, Birkenhead.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with puncture wounds was found at 07:55 in the morning at Grayson Mews on John Street.
The police call on people who have moved in the area to contact them and may have seen or heard something.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is only quite early, but I would ask anyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street and heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something, to contact us, as they may have important information for our investigation.”
The police spokesperson confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, a woman's alleged friends came to the scene asking questions about where she was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police said that they are informing the close relatives of the woman at the moment.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was stunned to hear of the incident.
The residents were told that re-entering them could take hours.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area was now treated as a crime scene.
One woman was on the scene in tears.
He repeated: “It is terrible.”
At two o'clock in the afternoon, the two police buses were still in the closed area and the third one was right next to it.
A number of police officers stood in the area and monitored the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about the event is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 using the 30 September log 247.
The Cromwell statue of the Parliament is the last memorial that is the cause of the “rewriting of history” dispute
Its elimination would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's religious and religious artifacts done by a man's followers of the inhuman squealers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as stupid and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In this debate on the elimination of statues, it was impossible for Oliver Cromwell to remain untouched by a memorial in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not loot pictures in the English Civil War himself, nor did he tell others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s excellent Cromwell presentation is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of the person to whom a number of people still think they should pay tribute.”
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "A lot of people considered at the end of the 19th, rather than today, Cromwell's parliament as a defender of external pressure and, of course, of royal power in this case.
Whether this is an accurate reflection is an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that the dispute in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.”
The killer pig was knocked to death by a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked on the market in south-west China by a pig who killed him.
A man who was only identified with his surname Yuan was found dead with an injured artery and covered with blood near the lipanshui market in Guizhou province, reported the South Chinese newspaper “Morning Post” on Sunday.
The pig keeper prepared to vaccinate pigs at his table in Qinghai Province, Xining, China, on 30 May 2005.
He was said to have come with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the pig feather next door was open.
He said there was a big squirrel with a bloody mouth.
The examination of forensics confirmed that 249,47 kilograms of squirrel had killed the farmer according to the report.
My cousin’s feet were all bloody and crushed,” the newspaper Guiyang Evening News conveyed the words of the victim’s cousin Wu.
Security camera recordings showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:40 a.m. to feed her pigs.
His body was found almost an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence on the scene.
The Yuan family and market leaders are allegedly discussing compensation for the death of a man.
Although rarely, it has been previously observed that pigs are attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, and a man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294,83 kilograms nailed to a Welsh farmer's tractor until a man's wife intimidated the animal away.
When in 2012 an Oregon farmer ate his own pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs usually do not attack, but because of the taste of the blood, they may have a crunch in their head.
They are just playful.
They are very curious macrats whose purpose is not to be injured.
They just have to be respected enough,” the man said.
Hurricane Rosa's afterwinds bring extensive rain to the southwest of the United States
The hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken, moving over the northern coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
Nevertheless, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding rains to North Mexico and the south-west of the US.
On Sunday morning at 5 p.m. east coast time, Rosa was classified as the first category of hurricane with blowing winds per hour, located 619.59 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure moving east towards the US West begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to direct deep tropical moisture towards the south-west of the US.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains down up to 25.4 centimetres.
Subsequently, the approaching low-pressure reactive tropical humidity in the south-west of the country will produce massive heavy rains in the coming days.
At times, the rain that has fallen from 2.54 to 10.16 centimetres causes dangerous flashes, flood water and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in rainfall from five to about seven and a half centimetres per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to have a rainfall of between 5.08 and 10.16 centimetres in certain areas of the south-west of the United States, particularly in Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to the dispersion of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
You should definitely not move on foot in the desert in the event of a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to turn into fast-flowing rivers and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by gusts of wind and volatile dust.
The approaching low pressure is sometimes accompanied by severe rains on the coastal areas of Southern California.
A total amount of precipitation of more than 1.27 cm is possible and can cause less flooding and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Distributed tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday evening and Monday Monday morning, with rainfall becoming extensive on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall arrives at Four Corner on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations are predicted in the US due to Arctic cooling, while in tropical areas temperatures remain high.
Sometimes this leads to major temperature changes in small areas.
The Sunday weather is an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central part of the US.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) amounts to almost 20 degrees.
The next few days, we will try to collect ourselves again in the long summer heat.
Much of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to start in warm October with temperatures around 80 degrees Celsius, from the plains of the south to the north-east of the country.
New York is expected to have 26.6 degrees warm on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that there is a likelihood of high average temperatures occurring in the first half of October in the eastern part of the USA.
Over 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people looked at the confessions of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who allegedly accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters discontinuing regular broadcasts to reflect the turn of the last minute on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drafted a contract for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Committee that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed him with a drunk head and tried to tear off his wife's clothes at the end of high school.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen's report, more than 20.4 million people looked at the transfer on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on the channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems calculating the number of people who view transfers in the authorities.
By comparison, it is about as large an audience as there is in the football finals games or the Oscars.
The opinion leaders of Fox News Channel, who have strongly supported the inauguration of Kavanaugh, led all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers at a full-day session, said Nielsen.
ABC with 3,26 million viewers remained in second place.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican office filed a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit a man on Friday morning, when he was caught in a protester's bulwark, trying to go to the sitting of the House of Representatives with a lift.
He stood behind his eyes for several minutes when he was accused and transferred directly to CNN.
I stand here, in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he is telling the country the truth?”
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are completely powerless.”
Flake said that his department had issued a statement and added that he had more to say at the sitting before the lift was closed.
Cable and broadcasting networks recorded a live broadcast several hours later, when the Legal Affairs Committee had to vote to refer the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate Assembly for voting.
But Flake said that he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate that have been demanded by the minority democrats next week.
Flake was partially persuaded by a conversation with a friend from the Democrat, Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an impact because it was obvious that the Republicans would not be able to meet Kavanaugh's votes without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations against the FBI.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of political play
In an interview with Sunday Times, the Prime Minister accused those who review his plans to leave the European Union, “a political game” of the future of Great Britain, and of harming national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the cover with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressurised his attack on May's so-called Brexit appeal, saying that the proposal to collect tariffs between the UK and the EU is "perfectly brain-free".
Shot of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of murdering a LSU player
The police arrested a man suspected of shooting the 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who died.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison on second-degree murder charges, said the Baton Rouge police officers.
The authorities released a video of opposition between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, reported the WAFB TV channel belonging to the CBS.
After Simpson was questioned, the police said that he had confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer reported that the man's bail was set at USD 350 000 (EUR 308 600,30).
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued an initial report on Friday, according to which the wound of the bullet in the head in the neck was the cause of death.
The department thanks the operation group of the Louisiana State Police Refugees, the state police forensics laboratory, the Southern University police and the people living in the area for the assistance given in the investigation, which led to the arrest of the suspect.
Joe Alleva, the sports manager of LSU, thanked the law enforcement agencies of the region for “dueness and fairness”.
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1.98 metre-long man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
His last season's games averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, a basketball coach at LSU, said that the whole team was "hit" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
This is something you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
The volcano erupts ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano called Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned Mexicans on Saturday, telling them to stay away from the volcano, as the crater again began operations, resulting in 183 cases of gas emissions and ash emissions recorded within 24 hours.
The centre monitored a number of noises and tremors.
The pictures shared in social media depicted an ashes-covered car window in various areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano 72 km southeast of the capital after the 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Police have clashes with the separatists of Catalonia before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona following a clash of pro-independence protesters with the riot police, and thousands joined the opposition to celebrate the opposition vote on the withdrawal.
A group of masked separation protagonists, who were held back by the riot police, attacked the latest with eggs and powder paint, creating thick dust clouds on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
The police had to use knives to control the fights.
For several hours “No forget, no forgiveness” the proponents of independence clashed with the pro-nationalist protestors who cried “Long live Spain!”.
According to the local press, 14 people who suffered minor injuries on demonstrations received medical care.
Tensions continue to be present in the region supporting independence a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but which was still marked by the pro-emergence Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although the turnout was low, as those who opposed the withdrawal largely ignored the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year when the police tried to block the vote in front of voting districts across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Proponents of independence had spent Friday night in front of polling stations to avoid demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the protests took place, but had to take another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a demonstration with his wife, said that he had no hope of seeing the prospect of independence.
Last year, one of the best moments of our lives took place.
I saw how my parents cried about the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, it has been difficult for political parties supporting Catalan independence to maintain their will to act this year, as a number of well-known leaders have either gone into exile themselves or have been detained and are awaiting trial for their part in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who records a demonstration to support the police with his mobile phone, said that the dispute was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidate for the elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the pressure exerted by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: the man was arrested because the car rammed the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was repeatedly rammed in Londonderry.
The case took place in Ballynagard Crescent around 19:30 British time on Thursday.
Detective investigator Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
A bow arrow could also be allowed towards the car at some point.
Menga's blow gives Livingston a 1–0 victory in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
The promoted Livingston grabbed the Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to the second defeat in 18 games, during which the man has been the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The blow by Dolly Menga turned out to be decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in seconds.
Gerrard remains undefeated in the first league this season and is facing the leading Hearts next Sunday, with eight points on the ground.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euroleague.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his invincible attack to seven games, while Chief Coach Holt still felt the taste of losing since the replacement of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses a chance against blunt visitors
Holt's team should have been in charge long before the goal was scored, as their immediate style of play caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts fell apart in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made an effort to capture Craig Halkett's main strike over the gate.
Hosts calmly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors in certain places.
And this is also the way the determining gate was scored.
Rangers gave up the free kick and Livingston had the opportunity to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in it from the middle of the penal area.
By then, the Rangers mostly possessed the ball, but were unable to penetrate the defense, which is why the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend the gate.
The Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor repulsed Scott Pittman's strike and Lithgow sparkled brightly in another team at Livingston.
The blows reached Livingston's penal area and were consistently thrown out of it, and two punishment strikes were also diverted away, one for the attempt to replace Glenn Middleton in the Halkett and the other for touching the ball with his hands.
A phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaron Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, surpassing the full expectations when moving up the ladder.
Their style of play and players have barely changed since they returned to the top, but Holt must be honoured for the way he has hardened the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a huge, perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their hind legs throughout the game.
The rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Regardless of their intermediate well-being under Gerrard's leadership, this was not enough, according to the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball turned out to be insufficient: reaching the home side only once, which could serve as an alarm for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan's controversial reception in Cologne
In Berlin, on Saturday (29 September) there were both smiles and clouds of concern when Turkish and German leaders met in the morning.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's conflicting visit to Germany, the aim of which is to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been left aside on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by banning the assembly of 25 000 people in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared close to seeing their president.
Hundreds protested against Erdogan, a large part of whom are Kurds, also made their voice heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to host the Turkish President in its country.
Fighting protests show that the attitude towards the guest is divided: some Turks living in Germany greet them as heroes, while others despise him as self-conqueror.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: cyclist killed as a result of a collision with a car
A cyclist crashed in London.
The collision took place on a high-speed road near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street crossing in Deptford, in the south-eastern part of the city around 10:15 British summer time.
The driver stopped and the ambulance doctors arrived, but the man died at the scene.
A collision took place a few months after another cyclist died in a collision nearly two kilometres from Saturday's crash site on Childers Street, where the driver who hit the cyclist fled the scene.
The London police said that the authorities are engaged in identifying the man and informing his loved ones.
At the scene of the event, traffic is closed and buses are redirected, motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six prison officers injured in riots
The Prison Board reported that six prison officers were injured in the riots in a highly secured men's prison.
The riots broke out in His Majesty's Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 09:30 after British summer time and have not yet ended.
In response to the riots in which eight prisoners are involved, expert riot police officers are involved.
Prison officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff are invited to handle the current case in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members received medical care due to injuries.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, it is handed over to the police and their detention may be extended.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison officer was informed that he was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, the riot police were called to prison to silence the serious riots in which prison officers were attacked with billiards bullets.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flashes (can be useful for drought areas)
The tropical low-pressure zone often does not hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, when the decaying hurricane Rosa moves across the southwestern desert of the United States, leading to the risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already arranged for the observation of sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, the south-eastern parts of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the region already on Monday with rainfall.
The Phoenix State Weather Service stated that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low pressure level within a radius of 321.86 km from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometres from the border with Arizona.”
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict rain from 5.08 to 10.16 centimetres, which can reach 15.24 centimetres in the restricted areas of Mogollon Rimi in Arizona.
In other desert areas in the south-western part of the United States, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Nõo, the rainfall is likely to range from 2.54 to 5.08 centimetres, reaching up to 10.16 centimetres in confined areas.
Suddenly intolerant areas, Rosa precipitation can be a blessing, as the area is suffering from drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rains are also likely to be beneficial as droughts prevail in South-West America.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, or second-largest, drought, reported weather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa Baja crosses the California Peninsula on land in Mexico.
Rosa, which was still at the hurricane level on Sunday morning with the largest winds of 6.43 kilometres per hour, is currently 619.95 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a rate of 19.31 kilometres per hour north.
The storm is in contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean and as a result is slightly decomposing.
Thus, Rosa is expected to arrive on land in Mexico at the height of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The amount of precipitation in certain regions of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
From Baja California to the north-western part of Sonora, rainfalls can be expected with a total volume of 7.62 to 15.24 centimetres, sometimes up to 25.4 centimetres,” said weather.com.
Rosa then heads north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning already as a tropical low-pressure crossing Arizona and reaching the south of Utah late on Tuesday night.
The main threat that follows Rosa or her sequelae is the very strong rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert of the southwestern US,” said the National Hurricane Centre.
These rains can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four murder arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy with puncture wounds was found in Somerset.
The young boy was found injured in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 British summer time.
The victim was taken to a hospital in a ‘stable’ condition.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock region of Avon and Somerset, said the police.
Officials ask anyone who may have mobile phone records of the case to contact.
Trump said Kavanaugh "had suffered" from the "crime and anger" of the Democratic Party.
Judge Kavanaugh’s support is a voice against the ruthless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in his exhortation speech in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered during the process of his appointment under the “crime and anger” of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh gave testimony to Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally rejecting the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford, according to which a man attacked her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a testimony on his charges at the sitting.
The President said on Saturday that “America saw the glory, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day”.
Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment is a vote to appoint one of the most valued lawyers of our time, with an impeccable background in public service,” he said to the supporting population of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the interim elections.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important choices in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am actually a candidate,” he said.
That is why I am everywhere to fight for great candidates.
Trump argued that the democrats were on a mission aimed at "stand up and stand in the way".
The first main proceedings on the Senate floor concerning Kavanaugh will be held on Friday at the latest, the Republican Party told the senior executives' assistant CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of deaths rising
At least 384 people died and many were blown up when the tsunami and the tsunami penetrated the beach after a severe earthquake hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday at the beach festival in Palu city, when, in good time, they created six metres of waves on the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that was left on the way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still doing what they were doing on the beach, not running away right away, thus becoming victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, press spokesperson of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, BNPB, at a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with it, sweeping everything from the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved on the high seas at a speed of 800 km per hour before it reached the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16 700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 centre.
Air photos published by the Disaster Board showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
Follow-up waves continued in the coastal town on Saturday.
A wave of earthquakes was felt in a region of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released in the wake of a strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times that of the nuclear bomb that was dropped into Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of a city along a long and narrow bay could have increased the strength of the tsunami, BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found under the wreckage of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and damage could be higher in the coastal area 300 km north of Palu, called Donggala, which was closer to the middle of the earthquake.
Reports from Donggala “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information”, Nugroho said.
The Red Cross said in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy that may get worse,” he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for failing to report the tsunami in the city of Palu, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach at the same time as the warning was issued.
The amateur images in the social media show a man on the top floor of a building who panics to warn people on the street below about the approaching tsunami.
A minute later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to confirm the accuracy of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout, which prevented communication in the Palu region and made it more difficult to organise the rescue work of the authorities.
The military has started sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities, said the authorities, but evacuators still urgently need food and other basic supplies.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, remaining otherwise closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths due to the Indonesian tsunami increased by more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the town of Palu, where they were hiding in the posters in the courtyard of their office, they saw sightings on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Although the auxiliary forces vigorously started operations to alleviate the disaster, some complained that foreign auxiliary workers with extensive experience were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian rules, foreign funding, supplies and reinforcements can only be sent if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
This continues to be a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, press spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
If the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we can start receiving international aid, but this has not yet been declared.”
When the second night in Palu arrived after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing people were still full of hope that their loved ones were the wonderful cases that ease the gloom of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was trapped in the rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
The Indonesian National Sliding Parachute Team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing Sliding Parachutes for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of those trapped in the Roa Road Hotel are his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
As a senior slide parachute, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke about how, after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel spread among the parachute community, he desperately sent messages to the rivals of WhatsApp who were at the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey tick instead of two blue ticks.
I think this means that the messages did not arrive,” he said.
The thieves took on 23 585.88 euros during the execution of the ATM in Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, the thieves stolen €23 585.88 from a Brink employee filling the Levees ATM, published in a press release as the Newport police station.
The driver emptied the ATM at the entertainment facility and prepared to bring more money, the detective wrote in a press release by Dennis McCarthy.
When a man acted, “the other man ran Brink's employee behind his back” and stole a bag for delivery that was full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, writing a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on early persons is asked to contact the Newport Police by phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper takes his new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced a change on Twitter, he wrote: “Former Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for some time, and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change takes place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where the man is expected to publish his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grandet, who canceled her concert “under the impulse of feelings”, the author of the show said.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of a man's present name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious importance to him.
I think “ye” is one of the most used words in the Bible, which means “you”,” West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, they are us.
I changed my name to Kanye, which means “this one”, to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye West is by no means the only rapper playing with her name.
Sean Combs is mainly known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also used his name with a dash of thought and without it, in uppercase and lowercase letters.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
At a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use the army against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the army to restrain the Mexicans”.
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration on the square on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were underway throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pulling young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this field,” said the donor and AI player Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were issued after various sections of the US government made statements on artificial intelligence, although the US generally lacks an official AI strategy.
At the same time, last year China presented its plan to be a pioneer in the upgrading of artificial intelligence by 2030.
A double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US and we are working towards the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double funding would double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC this week in an interview.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which financed one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won the best Othello player in America.
Lee recognised the technology contests of the previous U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the following dreamers.
US scientists need to work hard to get funding from the government,” Lee said.
China is not the one who takes over intellectuals, they are companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy could help the United States to support the efforts of artificial intelligence.
I think that people who have received a doctorate in artificial intelligence should be offered a green card automatically,” the man said.
China's State Council published its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a unified AI centre with the aim of involving partners from both industry and industry, while the White House announced the establishment of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it started financing the $2 million AI Next initiative.
But the National Science Foundation is currently funding over $100 million a year for research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aimed at setting up the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been amended.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted in a Sunday referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from accepting EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name is a requirement on this territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on a new name for Macedonia, but the ethnic opponents claim that the name would damage the national identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not intend to participate in the referendum and that the campaign had raised doubts as to whether the turnout would reach the 50% participation rate required for the referendum to take effect.
In the referendum, the question is: “Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price to pay to ensure Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for Macedonian youth, so that they could live freely under the protection of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to change its name.
The National Electoral Committee said that there were no irregularities at 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their vote on the Macedonian referendum on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, putting chairs in front of the tents for those who ignore the referendum.
We would like to belong to NATO and the EU, but we would like to join our heads up, not through the servants’ door,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become an integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
I believe that a large majority supports changing the name, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of belonging to the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said that "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
The results of a survey published by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia on Monday revealed that 30–43 per cent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
A survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of them said that they would say yes.
The rate of success of the referendum is 50 per cent, plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the government's Western policy after the government took over the leadership last May.
See: Sergio Aguero, a Manchester City player, goes through the entire Brigade for a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling penetrated the defense of Brighton, securing a 2–0 victory in Manchester City on Saturday at the football stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like his 65th minute goal was ridiculously easy.
The Argentine attacker passed the midfield sequence at the beginning.
He invaded three Brigadiers before he reached the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He invaded another defender before he ran past several players on the border of the Brighton penal area.
Then he hit the ball to the left of himself, where was Sterling.
The English attacker used the first blow to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the Brigade goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a hit on the right side of the net.
Aguero has problems with his legs,” said the manager of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
We said he was playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League battle.
The goal was scored on 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in this game clearly on the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball nicely to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane was able to hit the ball a few times before he led Sterling further.
Sky Blues moved the ball into the net just before it slipped out of the limits.
Manchester City plays in the Champions League sub-group with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the spoiler against Rockies
When the Nationalids were excluded from the tournament games, there was no great reason for a new start.
The fighter Scherzer, however, hopes to take down Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockie, who runs Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West with one game, still has hope to get to the final.
Rockies guaranteed Nationals at least a jockey spot on Friday night with 5–2 victories, but the team still wants to secure its first division position.
Although we are not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in Denver in this audience and other team atmosphere is probably at a higher level than any other game that might be waiting for me this year.
Why should I not want to compete here?”
The nationalists have not yet named the opening player on Sunday, but they claim to be inclined towards the Scherzer feed in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feeding, did a warm-up session on Thursday and feed on Sunday as usual.
This Washington right-handed player is led by 18–7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of strikes is 300, and the affordability of its 220 2/3 this season.
Trump makes an exhortation speech in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while at the same time talking about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the interim elections.
Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
This is a big event in which I don’t apply, but I’m actually applying, so I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this terrible, extremely terrible extremist group of democrats, and you can see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power by any means, seeing their viciousness and dirty play.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over for power and control. All they want is power and control over everything, and we don’t give it to them.”
According to him, the democrats are on a mission that aims to “stand up and stand in the way”.
And you have seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the democrats “agree, mean, vile and false.”
He referred by name to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat member of the Senate, who was shouted out loud among the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Um, what?
No, um, no, wait – it was one of the worst examples of body language, in fact the worst body language I have ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a large association.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinion
When my local party Momentum activists voted to condemn me, it was not very surprising.
After all, on the list of Labour MEPs, I am the last one to be told that you are not welcome, and all this for expressing your opinion.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because she stood up for a strong anti-Semitic response.
In my case, the condemners criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European affairs, which are strangely similar issues, on which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
In a note from the Nottingham East Labour Party, it was stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
In most cases, the experience of my eight-year-old local Labour Member with Friday evening general assembly meetings is exactly the same.
As of today, unfortunately, this is no longer the case for most meetings, and the promise to be “kinder and more generous” in politics has long been forgotten if it was ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different perspectives are not acceptable in the Labour Party and for each opinion it is assessed who is acceptable to the party's board.
It started immediately after Jeremy became leader, and the co-worker with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views was now waiting for me to change my mind and embrace positions that I would never otherwise agree with, whether it is a matter of national security or of the EU single market.
Whenever I step up in public, no matter what I actually say, it is followed by condemnation in social media, inciting my recall, ignoring the party's policy and saying that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more lucky than some of my fellow workers, as comments towards me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making of those collaborators who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how abuse levels have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a large association, and any change in the “distrust” initiative or the election rules will become narrower for the party.
In the last two years, I have been given a lot of advice to keep my head down, talk less, and “it would be all right.”
But that's not what I came to do in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had left my large school at the edge of literally collapse in the classroom, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who need it most, acting as both a member of the local council and a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my policy, including in the last elections.
There is no way that anyone in Nottingham East got confused about my political positions or areas of disagreement with the local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one of the threats or political considerations of recall will stop me from working for what I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have slightly tilted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win this wonderfully fun first league game in Tennent.
They are now the only unbeatable team among the ten at the top of the table.
Ultimately, it was a high level of protection for the team and better risk-taking that led to the victory of the home team, and coach Peter Murchi has every right to be satisfied.
We have been put to the test all the time during the games and we are still invincible, so of course I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “I respect Ayris, they used their opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute test, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a head start, but the yellow card given to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was ceded by Warriors to play, gave Melros the opportunity to have Jason Baggot perform a failed test.
Climo increased Ayr's success with a penalty shot just before the end of the half-time, reaching 17–5 in favour of Ayr by the end of the half-time with an individual event.
But Melrose successfully started the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, taken over by Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
After that, there was a long delay due to the serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken off the stretcher. As the game continued, Ayr further increased his head start thanks to Stafford McDowall's attempt, which was transmitted by Climo.
Ayr's CEO, Blair Macpherson, was then on a yellow card, but once again Melrose's player paid for the failed transfer of Bruce Colvine after heavy pressure.
However, the team playing on the home field gained strength again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for blocking Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson laid the ball behind the advancing Ayrides.
Climo passed on the ball, as he did almost immediately after continuing the game, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box shot and sent the flank guard to Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the team playing on the home field.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to take part in the hospitality industry after he was discovered to be the director of a recognized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a well-known BBC TV series he writes and plays with his long-standing comedy partner, Greg Hemhill.
The couple has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series and that Kiernan seems to make new plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but Scottish Sun's source suggested that Kiernan wanted to step into the "bloomy restaurant business" of Glasgow.
Sea is ours”: Bolivia without a maritime border hopes that the court will open their way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Over the buildings of the authority, ocean blue flags are flying.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with a motto: “The sea is our right.
It is our responsibility to restore it.”
In Bolivia without a fully sea border, the memory of the coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as is the living desire to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes are perhaps the highest of the last decades, as Bolivia awaits the verdict of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and the country naturally expects a positive result,” said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A number of Bolivians all over the country are looking at the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens, in the hope that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia after decades of discontinuous discussions in order to give the latter an independent path to the sea.
The charismatic native President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who will face a controversial battle for re-election next year, is at a lot of stake in Monday's decision.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he sweared at the end of August.
However, some analysts think that the court is unlikely to vote in favour of Bolivia, or if so, it would change very little.
The United Nations Office in the Netherlands does not have the power to transfer the territory of Chile and it has provided that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice will only be delivered six months after the final statements have been heard suggests that this was not a ‘complex case’, said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And moving away from the additional causes of Bolivia, the situation may have worsened for the past four years.
The problem of access to the sea has been abducted by the current Bolivian authorities,” Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent beauties have lost all of Chile's goodwill, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after all this, the debate will be extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the judgment of the court was unnecessarily swift.
Monday provides Bolivia with “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in the country’s relations with Chile” and an opportunity “to end the 139 years of disagreement with each other with mutual benefit”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most well-known presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue to express political resentment.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea said that the release of nuclear weapons will not take place until the country can trust the United States of America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never give up nuclear weapons first unless they could trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Meeting.
He called on the United States to review the promises made to each other by competitors' heads of state during the Singapore Summit.
He comments at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to start nuclear diplomacy again more than three months after his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said that these are air castles, considering that the US's continued restrictions and refusal to end the war with Korea will cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington will be cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, scepticism is common, according to which Pyongyang is seriously planning to abandon the armaments that the state is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree another Kim and Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Shows bring a series of massive headgears to viewers, brought to buyers on shopping streets in their neighbourhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you no longer need to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of strange super-big headgears to the stages of their summer season 2019 that blinded Paris Fashion Week.
High and impractical hats will be in fashion this summer via Instagram, and these designers have sent their daunting creations to the fashion stages.
Valentino's finest piece was a beige hat with overlays covering the heads of the models, decorated with a wide border resembling feathers.
Other huge items of clothing included watermelons decorated with jewels, a magic hat and even pineapple, but their purpose is not to insulate the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, just in time before Halloween.
A large part of the coloured masks had a sewn-up mouth, so they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One part of the creation resembled a diving costume with an air pipe and glasses, while the other resembled a melting ice cream wind.
And if you continue with huge fashion gags, you're lucky.
Fashion gurus predict that huge headgear can also reach shopping streets near you.
Ultra-large hats come right after La Bomba, a straw hat with a width of 60 centimetres, which has been seen in the head of all the famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created a largely impractical hat, launched into the social media, sent another great piece to the fashion openings – a shoulder-shaped beach bag that is almost as big as a model with a bikini.
The dark orange raffle bag with raffle fringes and a white leather handle was the top piece of the 2019 summer collection of Jacques La Riviera at the Paris Fashion Week.
Fame stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on the shopping streets next summer. As the designer has had such a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for huge items of clothing.”
John Edward: language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scottish private schools have remained at the forefront of academic excellence and continued to do so in 2018 with the following outstanding test results, reinforced by personal and joint success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, with over 30 000 students studying across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council (SCIS), seek to offer their students and their parents the best service.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we can see that modern languages continue to be well-known and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it will come to his mind.
When you talk to him in his mother tongue, it reaches his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s fresh exam results show that there are languages at the top of the tables where the rate of passing the exams is the highest among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score of A.
The data collected from a total of 74 SCSI schools show that 72 percent of students received an A rating in Mandarin, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students received the same grade.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages that are now among the choice of subjects are in the curricula of private schools and other schools in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A study carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find workers for job vacancies, 17% of respondents reported a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language training is becoming more and more mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future work.
As more promising job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choices made, acquiring a second language will give a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens gives a multilingual person immediate competitive advantage.
According to a survey conducted in 2013 by YouGov, more than 4000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of respondents do not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation about it. The only language with a two-digit percentage of speakers was French with 15 percent.
Therefore, the funding of language learning is now important for today's children.
The knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
A number of schools tend to focus on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK in terms of 2020 such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future brings them.
It can no longer be denied that, in a global business environment, languages are essential for the future of the country, which is why this must also be reflected in education.
It is the modern languages that should really be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Private schools continue to offer young Scots a choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Avid admirers no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James was playing a pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But his game minutes still have to be determined.
This is more than one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a number of minutes.
After his training last week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
I do not need pre-season games to warm up at this stage of my career,” he said.
Trump West Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start his election campaign series this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first five campaign events scheduled for next week, including stays in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time as the vote of confirmation is pending, Trump will try to increase his support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republicans will be threatened by the abolition of control in Congress following the November vote.
At what time is Trump's campaign in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia will take place on Saturday evening, September 29, 2018 at 5:00 East Coast time.
The Trump West Virginia campaign event can be watched online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to speak about the sessions of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, which became tense in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate's confirmation vote is suspended for a week until the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main goal of the campaign series is to help the Republican people who are facing difficult elections in November to gather new momentum.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign leader said that the aim of these five events next week is to “encourage volunteers and supporters when Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters mediated.
Control of Congress is so important for the President's agenda that Trump is going to dive into as many states as possible during the fast election campaign season,” said Trump's spokesperson to Reuters, who did not want to mention his name.
This evening’s campaign event, which is planned to take place at the Wesbanco stadium in Wheeling, can bring in supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania and also get coverage in the Pittsburgh media”, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the last month, a state where he received more than 40 percent of the voter's vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the rankings on the basis of surveys.
For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has come to stimulate his results,” said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team has nerves for the competition, keeping hopes high before single Sunday games
After three single sessions, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating turning point pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sports, but players truly believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
So, where do they think the turning point would be right now?
They’ve steered six points, which have now become four, so I think this can be considered a small turning point,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear, because it is controlled by four points and there are 12 more points in the game.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel that they do not have enough winds to sail, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four.
Spieth has been a stupor for both the pond and the green and shows an example.
These cries of victory from the throat became louder and louder with each round, overshadowing the defining putty that would have led to a tie in the fourth match after he and Thomas were on the ground with two.
His putty, which won the match on the 15th, was accompanied by a similar cry, which showed the man's belief that the Americans were not yet out of the competition.
You just need to be more focused and worry about your match,” said Spieth.
This is the only thing players can do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have the Ryder Cup undisputed stars Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood
Europe's strange but loved couple is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple who did not hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows back and forth into the noisy crowd strengthens the view that the players who are competing on Sunday and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, there is no better known player than Fleetwood or Molinari to confirm a possible European victory.
Preferably both at the same time to different holes.
However, the tales of European glory are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two in the first nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep that they had no hope of getting themselves out of it.
On Saturday, however, there is no one to help you out in August.
Four-balls and doubles are extremely attractive to look closely at, precisely because of the communication between couples, the advice given to each other, the advice that has not been given, and how the way can change in an instant.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far and has taken the lead for the last day with a strong head start, but this session of the Quartets showed that the US team had some doubts about how to fight, especially the Americans.
Europe to lead the Ryder Cup on the last day 10–6
Europe will have a good head start on the last day of the Ryder Cup, taking the lead in front of the United States of America after Saturday's four-balls and doubles.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two victories in front of the struggling Tiger Woods to raise their current score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the cup lost in Hazeltine, ruled the American side in four-ball in the morning after failure, winning the 3-1 series.
The US offered more resistance in doubles, winning two games, but they could not make up for the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points of Sunday's 12 singles to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who is called Molliwood after this booming weekend, they are the second pair to win four points in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having destroyed four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a chance to shine, but now lost their 29 four-ball and doubles 19, losing seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested for four-balls in the morning, returned to doubles with partner Henrik Stenson, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who ranks first and third in the world order.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held with a pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
The three-time biggest winner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set the Americans two points as a benchmark on Saturday.
They won in four-ball against 2-1 Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning in doubles Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3, having lost two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team come back from a four-point deficit, going into single games, although as owners, Furyk's half needs only a draw to preserve the cup.
Although being the second best in two days, it seems after a Sunday counterattack that they will not succeed.
North Korea says that ‘no way’ they will not be unarmed due to a unilateral lack of trust
The North Korean foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continuing restrictions deepened their distrust of the United States and that the country does not intend to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the annual meeting of the World Organisation, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear test site and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But we don’t see the U.S. responding,” he said.
Without trusting the United States, our country lacks security and, in such circumstances, we are in no way willing to make ourselves unarmed in the first place.
Although Ri reiterated the familiar complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to a ‘step-by-step’ nuclear-free approach, under which North Korea would be condemned if he took step-by-step steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject the unilateral withdrawal of nuclear weapons, as Pjongjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to move towards a “no nuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has wished to officially end the 1950-53 war in Korea, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for the relaxation of the strict international restrictions against North Korea.
The U.S. demands “the first withdrawal of nuclear weapons” and increases the pressure of restrictions to achieve their goal in a forced manner, even opposing the declaration of the end of the war,” said Ri.
The idea that restrictions put us on our knees is a dream for people who do not know us at all.
But the problem is that the continuing restrictions will aggravate our distrust.”
Ri did not mention Kim's and Trump's plans for the second summit, which the U.S. leader at the UN emphasised earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the meeting between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were one of the parties to the nuclear issue, not the US, the issue of the nuclear proliferation of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
However, Ri's speech suddenly differed from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that turning to the US continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Bad President" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had completely threatened North Korea last year, praised the United Nations for Kim's courage to take steps towards becoming unarmed, but added that there is still much to be done and that restrictions must remain in place until North Korea's nuclear weapons are abandoned.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, saying: "Does it take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should award for the measures taken by Pjongjang.
At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “The restrictions of the Security Council must continue to be enforced forcefully and unfailingly until we can fully and definitively confirm the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions on North Korea in an effort to prevent funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met next to the UN General Assembly in Riga and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
Following his meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, after which he was condemned by North Korea in just a few hours for “gangster-like demands”.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missiles and the nuclear complex if the United States were to implement “appropriate measures”.
He said that Kim had told him that, by means of ‘the appropriate measures’, he meant the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and the movement towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to combat the growing aggressive culture of studying caffeine-rich night-time learning marathons.
Students who love the academicity of the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to the basics of caring for themselves.
This course was designed by Dr. Charles Czeisler, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School, and expert professor at Brigham and the Women's Hospital, who said it was the first of its kind in the United States.
He inspired the creation of the course after he gave a speech on how sleep disorders affect learning.
At the end of this, a girl came to me and asked: “Why is this only now, in my last school year?”
He said that no one had ever told him the importance of sleep - it struck me off,” he explained to Telegraph.
The course, which first came into the curriculum this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting results, and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director of Health at the University, said that the University decided to take a course of study after it was found that the students were in serious sleep deprivation during the working week.
The one-hour course covers a number of interaction tasks.
In one section, a picture of the dormitory is presented, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books, and explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how lack of sleep affects sporting results and the importance of the established sleeping practice.
The second part explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map with responsive symbols encourages participants to think about their everyday practices.
We know that this does not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, night-time learning marathons are still proud, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students rather means that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
“Ensuring adequate quality sleep time should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he added. “It even helps against weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into hunger mode, making a person constantly hungry.”
A 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, Raymond So, helped Professor Czeisler create the course, having attended one of his classes in the previous year, his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for both going to bed and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” generated by electronic displays and LED lighting, as this can damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gate defeated Gerrard's men
The rangers suffered another bad guest match when Dolly Menga's blow, accompanied by Steven Gerrard from the side, brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
The Ibrox side hoped to win its first guest victory from February, when the 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but the team of Gary Holt only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a leader, remaining eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership's leader Hearts.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before half-time, and Rangers' poor readiness could not recover from it.
The Rangers thus fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place, remaining under Hibernian with only one goal.
For Rangers, the problems may not be over yet, because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound treatment after he was hit by an apparently discarded object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side, which passed Ayrist and Betfred Cup semi-finals.
At the same time, Holt went on with the same Livi 11, who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been satisfied with the way his well-trained boys stifled their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have been more dominant in the village, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored a goal as early as the second opening minute, when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through the Allan McGregor Gate, but the midfielder did not take advantage of his opportunity.
Deep Keaghan Jacobs' free kick was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but its defence partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide arched blow to the rear of the post.
The rangers achieved control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he collided with Steven Lawless on the 15th minute of the game, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy the Columbia player's complaint.
In the first half of the year, the Rangers managed to make only two strokes to the target, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not worry about Lassana Coulibaly's main strike or the Ovie Ejaria event.
Although Liv's 34-minute kick off may have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely because of their performance.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to restrain Jacobs' deep hard performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball on Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose Menga, who just completed the plan.
Gerrard was active during the break, swapping Coulibly for Ryan Kent, which almost paid off when the winger split Morelos, but impressively Kelly jumped to stop his seat.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the type of game that suits them, where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
Holt's side could have promoted its leadership at the final stage, but McGregor stood firm, preventing Jacobs before Lithgow created a large arched corner.
The Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again requested a punitive kick when he and Jacobs went up and down, which Thomson again did not satisfy.
Almanahh: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and COUNTING... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure the radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From this foundation of science, the Geiger counter also became the foundation of popular culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado watches, where in the main parts they were seemingly unlikely to be made by cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is this thing?”
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
It is possible to hear the pona of the atoms released from the radioactivity of minerals when wearing these ears.”
Evans: “Don’t you tell me it’s still poking!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945 just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name continues to live.
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to “see” the scammer cells
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to “see” scammers and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know the swindler cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing these cells in the laboratory
Then they are able to “see” a common protein for many cancers and they are injected back
The vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to detect chemist cells disappeared from her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are changed in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein that is common in various HER2 cancers, and then injected back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “leads growth of many types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, was explained by Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where patients are taken from immune cells and trained to target cancer cells, has been used to treat a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West started with the support of Trump by wearing the MEGA hat on the SNL live show.
It didn't go very well.
In Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West's derogatory whistle-blowing whistle-blowing choir came out after her mixed speech, in which she praised US President Donald Trump and announced her application to the same post in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, called Ghost Town, where he wrote Make America Great, he began to shout against the democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I have spoken so much to the white people who ask me, “How can you like Trump, he is a race?”
If I were so worried about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started a device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood's fame made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judges' committee regarding the alleged sexual violence of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this part of the show was not broadcast, West's noisy images were uploaded to the comedian Chris Rock's social media.
It remains unclear whether Rock tried to blaspheme West's post.
West also complained to the audience that it was quite difficult for him behind the scenes in connection with his hat.
They fooled me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go there, hat on my head.
They fooled me!
And then they say that I am drowned in a place,” he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see the sunken place? I put on my Superman cloak, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
His comments triggered the viewers' resentment at least twice and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. According to Variety, one person said: “The whole studio remained deadly.”
West had been brought to the show last minute to replace Ariana Grande, because the singer's ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West amazed many with the song “I Love it”, which at the time he presented it looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “Thank you for one brave soul: THANKS, FOR BRINGING TO THE Crowd.”
But the presenter, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just “who she is, and it is absolutely wonderful.”
But I decided not to award (buying my own music or clothing or supporting his “art”) to someone who, in my opinion, believes and spreads a world view that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name by saying that he is now “formerly Kanye West.”
He is not the first singer to change his name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, the rapper Snoop Dogg has been named after the Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly departed music legend Prince, who turned his name into a symbol.
The murder trial and accusation related to the stabping of the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the case took place in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the defendant will appear before the Belfast Supreme Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
The fame of the game of Thrones Kit Harington does not approve of the masculinity of the fank
Kit Harington is known for his flashing role in Jon Snowina HBO's violent medieval fantasy series The Game of Thrones.
But the actor (31) unloads the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that “something has gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie (31), a collaborator of the Game of Thrones, admitted that he felt “fairly strong” that this problem needed attention.
I feel quite strongly, personally, that we have gone wrong with masculinity somewhere,” he said.
“What have we taught men when they grow up in connection with the problem we now see?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise in the masculinity of the fank, because it shows super-manlike characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be just like that if they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
Because obviously something has gone wrong for young people.”
In the survey, he also admitted that after the end of the series, none of the Game of Thrones will ever participate in the next summer, saying that he is “on the same side with his battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit Sam Shepard has been involved in the revival of True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his robber brother.
The actor recently announced that he considered his wife Rose to be the best match for the Game of Thrones.
I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played the beloved of Ygritte, Kit's character Jon Snow, in an award-winning fantasy series with Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at a family home of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased exponentially to 14%.
According to healthcare professionals, more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
Around 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases have arisen from sex, thus changing the past.
HIV transmitted by infection in some parts of China.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is said to be high.
Due to the old-fashioned values of the country, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many transmissions of diseases are related to the insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaking of employee GOP Senator data by saying that they are “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, US Representative Maxine Waters condemned allegations that her employee had posted personal data of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are spread by "ultra-right" trolls and their websites.
Lies, lies and even more despicable lies," said Waters in its Twitter statement.
The published information allegedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Utah).
Information was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person during the hearing of the Senate panel at Capitol Hill in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct by the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-minded websites like Gateway Pundi and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the broadcast was linked to the Waters office and issued membership information for the Waters employee, Hill reported.
This unfounded statement is complete and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees whose identity, personal data and safety are at risk because of their fraudulent and false claims are not responsible in any way for this information.
This unfounded statement is a complete and irrefutable lie.’
The Waters statement was quickly reviewed on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
This denial is a result of anger," Fleischer wrote.
This indicates that he has a sentimental feature that is not appropriate for a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not get angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must remain calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the democrat against Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate, Omar Navarro, who is applying for the position of Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
Important when it comes to the truth, he swept.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office had warned ‘the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities in relation to their fraudulent allegations’.
We will do everything we can to find out who the criminals are,” he continued, “and to make them legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Under-equipped Rowan Atkinson spy parody
It is now common practice to seek the meanings of Brexit in all new British films and this seems to be particularly relevant in the parody series of Johnny English Action Comedy - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was resurrected in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Are humorous about ourselves on the topic of how obviously stupid we are in the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the punn-eyed rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has been allowed to do things again in his pawful way - and that this wide comic creation is intended for non-English-speaking filmmakers.
Of course, it's a secret agent who, despite his strangely elegant smoothie glamour, looks a bit like Clouseau, a little bit of Mr Bean, and a little bit of a character who gave a tone to the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on a passenger and international secret Atkinson, who was once played in forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving only chaos.
There is only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE film.
I liked the approach to the Johnny English helicopter when he wore medieval armour and the rotors of the helicopter spoke for a moment against his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent to make a physical comedy is shown, but humour seems less important and strangely superfluous, especially when “serious” spy films like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer their own comedy with confidence.
It seems that this humour is more intended for children than for adults, and for me, Johnny English's clever adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent films as Bean.
At the moment, there is an ever-present assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has penetrated the UK's top secret spy web network, revealing the identities of all British secret police officers, thereby causing a great disappointment to the on-site agent - regrettably a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a festive and troubled character who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character perfectly, but there is not much in the manuscript to work on.
His intelligence advisors suggest that, since all active spies are at risk, he must recall someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in a proud institution, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of good places where English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is launched back to Whitehall for emergency notification and reunited with its former long-term partner Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So the stains of the secret service of Batman and Robin, his Majesty, are in action again, in the places of Olga Kurylenko embodied a beautiful femme with fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the hands of a charismatic tech billionaire, who claims to be able to solve all British computer problems: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin with their pity odyssey: hiding as waiters, they put a fire on the French restaurant; they create chaos by secretly landing a Volta luxury yacht on board; and English launches a genuine disorder when it tries to use a virtual reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta House.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as sweet and fast as it is, the whole thing has the taste of children's TV.
Quite mediocre stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I found myself thinking: does the British film industry really not have Rowan Atkinson to give a role that would be fair to his talent?
The Labour Party denies drawing up a plan where the British work four days a week but are paid five days a week
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a pivotal plan that foresees that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party wants the company's bosses to pass on the savings they received through the Artificial Intelligence Revolution (AI) to their employees, giving them one extra day off.
So employees would have a three-day weekend - but they would get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would fit in with the economic agenda of the party, and so the state is going to tilt in favour of the employees.
Thursday's working week is approved by the Congress of the Trade Union so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
The source of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "It is expected that the draft will be announced before the end of the year.
This is not overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits in with the party's approach to balancing the economy both in favour of employees and with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole does not support this endeavour at the moment.
The Labour Party spokesperson stated: "Four-day working week is not a party policy and it is not discussed by the party."
Undersecretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to clarify his vision of a social transition in the economy.
McDonnell said that he had decided to take back power from the “unsighted leaders” and “profit-earners” of utilities.
The Deputy Secretary-General’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover their entire shareholding, as the Labour Party could make ‘deductibles’ in connection with perceived misdemeanor.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in the company’s management boards and create inclusive ownership funds to provide 10% of private equity to employees, instead of providing annual bonuses of up to €561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak on 60 Minutes, whether the investigation of the FBI Kavanaugh can change their minds
The investigation of the charges brought by the FBI against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote in the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the conclusions of the Bureau could affect the termination of support for senators from the Republicans.
In a Sunday survey, Scott Pelley's Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, co-host of 60 Minutes, asked if the FBI could reveal something that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Of course,” said Kennedy.
I said I'm going to the hearing. I said I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and said, “Did you do it?”
He was decisive, firm and unambiguous.”
Graham's voice seems to be rock-proof.
I am sure of my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and it could only be changed in a bombshell,” he said.
Dr Ford, I don’t know how it happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all whom he has named could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see anything new coming.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the New York Global Citizen Festival will host an annual music event with a hugely impressive audience and the same impressive goal: to eradicate poverty from the world.
Now, for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn area not only enjoying singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international law firm that hopes to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests had to perform a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to some of the world’s leaders, call or do something else important to help raise their awareness of the goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been if it is another 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another clicker where people feel they are doing something important by signing an application online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “activities” of its supporters in an effort to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped global leaders to communicate more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and communications resulting from their activities, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to “help children to take full advantage of all their abilities”, promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historical footnote of social injustice,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Nutrition, to the crowd during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that, following more than 5000 actions calling for improvements in nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced a funding project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in need of nutrition interventions.
In response to one FAQ on your website asking “what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: "This is a long and difficult path - sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that we face, we are confident in our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a couple of performers who will perform this year in New York at an event led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the naval “barrier” to prevent Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
According to Washington Examiner, Washington may, if necessary, use its naval force to prevent the Russian energy market from being hit, including in the Middle East, the U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has published.
Zinke argued that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it operates at the request of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the rut of southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
The United States has this opportunity to ensure, with the help of our naval forces, that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he added.
Zinke’s statement was addressed to the participants of an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that represents the US “energy consumer voice”.
He went to Washington to compare approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
Iran and Russia have more or less economic choice, boosting and replacing fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one trick pony”, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the task of the government of Trump is to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump Administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to foreclose the ‘unsuitable’ Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow’s ‘prisoner’.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak at a meeting in Moscow in September with US energy minister Rick Perry.
The U.S. stance has been set back from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Confederation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements with Berlin and Moscow.
I have a great problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Confederation of Industries (BDI), after the recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren seriously considers becoming president in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was seriously considering applying for president in the interim elections.
At Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his consideration of his claim.
It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and this includes the first lady,” said The Hill.
After 6 November, I am seriously considering applying for President.
Warren also assessed the actions of President Donald Trump in the Town Hall, saying that he “would lead the country in the wrong direction.
I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has expressed criticism at Trump and its Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “Of course we need an investigation into the FBI before we vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think that he should stand as a candidate in 2020.
According to a poll by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, 58% of the ‘probable’ Massachusetts voters thought that the Senator should not stand as a candidate.
32% supported such a request.
The survey showed more support for the candidacy of the former governor Deval Patrick, 38% supported the potential candidate and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 nomination include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, said Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palini PTSD at Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq since September of recruitment.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with
What my son is going through, what he will experience when he comes back, I am able to associate myself with other families who know the consequences and wounds of PTSD, with which our soldiers will return,” he told the audience at the Donald Trump gathering in Tulsa, Octaham.
Palin called the arrest of his son “the elephant in the room” and, in connection with his son and other war veterans, said that “they will come back a little different, they will come back hardened, they will come back thinking whether there is enough respect for what soldiers and pilots and all other military personnel have given to the state.”
On Monday, he was arrested in Alaska in Wasilla and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, interference in the report on a domestic violence case and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxicated state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the Columbia Region challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbian region support a legal challenge to a new US policy that bans asylum from victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 countries and regions made a brief statement of their court friends in Washington on Friday to support the challenging policy of asylum seekers, NBC News announced.
The applicant’s full name, Grace v. Sessions sutis, submitted in August by the American Civil Liberties Association against the Union’s policies has not been published.
The woman said that her accomplice “and her violent gang-member sons” abused her, but the U.S. officials did not accept her application for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
National lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce large numbers of US asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented migrants to flee from domestic violence in order to lodge an asylum application.
Karl Racine, Chief Prosecutor of the Columbia Region, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "will ignore national, Union and international law for decades".
The federal law requires all asylum applications to be dealt with in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle,” stated the brief statement of the court friends.
Lawyers also stated in a brief statement that the denial of entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy by saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce”.
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
The application for asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a communication of 11 June.
The aim of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious ones - that people face every day.
Entertainment rescue operations in plus, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly threatening.
The situation is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fevered little boy in the evacuation centre of the affected town of Palu.
Every minute, new people arrive with an ambulance.
There is not enough clean water.”
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through soaked things and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some injured, including a broken back and upper arm, Dwi Haris rested outside of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated for severe aftershocks.
The tears filled his eyes when he recalled how a strong earthquake rocked his hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his husband and daughter.
There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pressed against the wall in ruins,” Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
I heard my wife cry, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are not in danger.”
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “bullying with incitement ads”
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published four pages of daily news about the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador accused Beijing of using American press propaganda propaganda in China.
US President Donald Trump referred to an annex paid by China Daily last Wednesday in the Des Moines Register - the largest edition of the Iowa state - after China was accused of interfering in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to intervene in the US elections marked what the US officials described as a new stage in the expanding Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to promote trade in advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, where the import tariffs of each other are adjusted.
Chinese countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were designed to capture exporters from states such as Iowa, because they supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts have explained.
The U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, as well as China's largest agricultural exporter, Terry Branstad, said Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Brandstad wrote in a Sunday Des Moines Register opinion article: “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing agitation-advertising in our free press.”
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the expensive freedom of speech of America and the practice of free press, putting its paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
On the other hand, there are only limited voices in the Beijing street kiosk and they do not see the truly different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s alarming economic direction, given that the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of the most prominent newspapers in China refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper was involved.
Analysts warn that the Republicans will alienate female voters before the interim elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting for and defending the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of several sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a setback during the upcoming interim elections, especially women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in the ceiling, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Maxwell University, Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday to The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) in connection with the investigation of the FBI was sufficient to reassure the angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC, Senior Advisor and National Representative, on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters repeated “November is coming!” at a demonstration in their Senate corridor, as the Republicans, who control the judges’ committees, decided to proceed with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey’s Ford’s testimony, reported Mic.
“Democratic spirit and internal sovereignty are beginning to fall outside the schedule,” said the informal political analyst Stu Rothenberg.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among the female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29 years of age, who do not like the president and often do not vote.”
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of a sexual attack against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts predicted a setback as the Republicans move forward with the confirmation.
This has become very confusing for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republicans, according to NBC News at the beginning of last week.
This is not just about the Commission's vote, the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated him,” said Guy Cecil, the head of the US (a group that helps to choose democrats), who drew attention to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided, who believe in Ford after the testimony and who supports Kavanaugh, but a little more than that.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied at the time of his testimony, while only 30% thought about the same Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other accusation against Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford declared last week before the Senate's Judges' Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals when they attended a party during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new internet that would get rid of Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a start-up to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project Inrupt is a company that will build the Berners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are given access to information.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was “world governance”.
We have to do this now," he said about the start-up.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online database” or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and competent tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser and at the same time.
This personal online database is unique because the user can choose who can access this information.
The company calls it “to grant personal authorization through data”.
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring sources, process and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM-purchased security platform, some developers hired under contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not talk to “Facebook and Google, whether to make a complete change if all their business models are fully supported overnight.
We do not ask for their permission.
On Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vant: A memorial stone for the clergy, which had become the cross of Victoria in World War I, was opened
The only church in England that received the Victorian cross during World War I celebrated its 100th anniversary in its home town.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van van fought out his badge of honor in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
But he died four days later by a sniper bullet and did not know that he had received the highest British military award.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it would be “geniously symbolic” if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after the grandpa's award-winning fight.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin, “through a very thick mist and a gun and a gun gun's bullet hail.”
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and moved it with the “biggest galance” before he rushed to one machine gun alone and knocked out three opponents.
Lieutenant Colonel Vani killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - when the end of the war was just a little over a month.
Michael Van (72) said that his grandfather’s activity was “something I know I will never be able to repeat, but for which I will always be grateful.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van placed a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood's royal youth band.
Michael Van said he was “very honoured to participate in this parade” and added that “the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero can be appreciated.”
MMA fans were up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but only saw the Piglet Peppa
Imagine having been up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but this main event is not going to show you.
The San Jose match included 13 fights, including six from the main maps, and was shown in the UK on Channel 5 all night long.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to cross each other, the UK audiences fell out of their mouths as Peppa appeared on the screen in Piglet.
Many were not excited about it, especially those who had stayed awake until the early hours to see this very fight.
On Twitter, a fan described the transition to children's cartoon as "no hurt joke".
This is the government's regulation that content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to the children's program,” explained Dave Schwartz, elder vice-president of Bellator in marketing and communication issues when asked about the transfer.
Piglet Peppa, yes.
Bellator's President Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to take more into account the UK viewers in the future.
If I think about the crisis, I think we can solve this problem in the future,” Coker said.
But if it's 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, we can't do it until our Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical failure.
But it was not, it was a government rule.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of six fights, we show the reference - as we usually do - we tried to offer more to fans, and we just went over with time.
This is a difficult situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “undervalued” in relation to sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic-winning diver, says he grew up feeling more undervalued because of his sexuality - but this gave him an incentive to succeed.
A 24-year-old man said he didn't understand "everyone is not like him" until high school.
Taking part in Lauren Laverne Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
Getting older also changed his attitude to winning the Olympic Games, giving the feeling that this is no longer so important.
The usual long-term host Kirsty Young had to take a couple of months off because of his illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt less valuable when growing up than others, because it was not socially acceptable if you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, these feelings are that I am not worthy and feel different, given me power and strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was worthy of “something” and did not disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic winner has become the leader of the highly regarded LGBT campaign, using his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others.
The triple world champion said that falling in love with a man - the U.S. film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - “hit him as a surprise.”
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
When you go through so much when you were young - he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his “full outlook” has changed.
If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
But you know, there are many more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after a brain tumour was diagnosed.
Daley said that his father did not agree to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I could not tell him that “Father, you cannot sit in the front row because you will no longer be there”, he said.
I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the home crowd at the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling about it,” he said.
It also inspired her first choice of song - the Heather Small Proud - which helped her to prepare for the Olympic Games and still gives her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of form Mickelson was removed from the game on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played a record 12th time every two years at the event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday doubles and four-balls.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has often been for the US, the five-time winner divided his day into two, being an incentive and working on his game, in the hope of improving it.
Never the most direct striker, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old is not very suitable to play on a narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long rough track is constantly punishing misfires.
And if the square itself is not terrified enough, on Sunday, in its ninth competition, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molina, who has joined forces with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four races this week.
If the Americans, who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 singles, start hot, the McKelson competition can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he did not have much else to add.
He fully understood his role today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk added.
He is very confident.
He is a celebrity and he has given so many of our teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't foresee him playing two games.
I saw more, but it went so, and we had to choose such a path.
He wants to be out like everyone else.”
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the most played player in the Ryder Cup.
It can mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which, however, has never met his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven drawes, but Furyk said his presence has made an additional mental contribution to the team.
He’s funny, blinking, witty, likes to have fun with people and he’s just great in the team room,” he explained.
I think the younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week and it was nice to see that.
He offers much more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great head start may soon be lost
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that Ryder Cup's last day's leadership at the start of single games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
The Dane made a public appearance at the 1997 Valderrama competition, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, a five-point lead was held in front of the Americans, but when it reached the finish line, it had been drastically reduced, only 141⁄2 : 131⁄2 was won.
You even remember that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, this victory came very close,” said the Bjorn in the picture after the Class of 2018 victory 5:3 on Friday and yesterday with success 10:6 in Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points in it.
We have a goal, which is to win the cup, and so we will focus on it.
I have always said, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we are very aware of who is our opponents - the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players have played on this heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush ahead of time.
Tomorrow there will be completely new obstacles.
Tomorrow, personal performance counts, so it's something else.
It's nice to be with the opponent if things go well, but if you're there personally, you'll be tested to the full extent as a golfer.
This is the message you have to send to the players - do your best tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner, he must also go and manage himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will personally work better than with his opponents, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four.
Furyk himself has experienced both in recent days, being a part of the Brookline victory team, before becoming a part of the defeat of the “Medinah miracle” of Europe.
I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how, in 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put everything in his game on the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start hot, like in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average competitions.
We set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the court in a way where we feel that tomorrow a miracle can happen.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the competition, and he is best placed to compete with Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
I put my boys in that order, because I think we're well covered," Bjorn said in his selection of individual games.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The latest high-speed sailboat in the German Navy should have been introduced in 2014, replacing the warships of the outdated Cold War, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and increased costs as a snowball, the local media reported.
The launch of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class high-speed sailing boat ‘Rheinland-Palatinate’ has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the military press release published in Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy as early as 2014, but the alarming post-delivery problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the old Bremen class high-speed sailors.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some masking technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and audible signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to send the latest fast sailboats out of home port for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships - which promise to strengthen power in Germany abroad - will become obsolete by the time they arrive.
The failed F125 fast sailboat appeared on the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time that the navy had sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after it had been received.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media quoted a number of important ‘software and hardware deficiencies’ that made the warship unusable if they had been used on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as Baden-Württemberg class ships are managed by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of the senior Bremen class.
It also showed that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future innovations.
The ‘Rheinland-Palatinate’, which weighs 7000 tonnes, is probably twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project also becomes a problem, including training the team.
It is said to amount to €3.1 billion (€3.6 billion) - compared to the original €2.2 billion.
Problems with newer high-speed sailboats are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German navy's capacity is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy actually had ‘no more ships to be taken out’.
The official said that this topic has grown over time as a snowball because old ships were removed, but there were no replacement ships.
He regretted that none of the high-speed sailboats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust investigates the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to find their own food.
It is hoped that the results will provide a new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future conservation measures.
A study by Scottish National Trust researchers monitors common and soprano-pipels in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders are placed in the main areas of the site to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also perform field studies using hand-held sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings determines the frequency of bat cries and the activity of the species.
A habitat map and report are then created to create a detailed landscape of their behaviour.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help determine the usefulness of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the UK as a whole, the population of bats has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affects their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching catches than their eyes.
They use complex echo location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, inspections and sometimes also rescue.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only special bat reserve in Threave in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
The property manager, David Thompson, says that this area is the ideal territory for them.
In Threave, we have a big area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and a great place to live.
But there is still a lot to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas helps us better understand what they need.”
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before taking care of real estate, as the unwanted destruction of one of the sites of gestation and childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the bat protection association, has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations while lawyers are planning to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected the rape charges against him as a fake news, saying that people “want to advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers have been accused of rape with Kathryn Mayor in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He said he had paid a woman EUR 330 643,10 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spiegel announced on Friday.
Turning to a live video on Instagram to the 142 million followers an hour after the accusations, Ronaldo (33) announced that they were "false news".
No, no, no, no.
What has been said today is false news,” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner to news.
They want to promote themselves by my name.
This is common.
They want to be famous with my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a lucky man and everything is fine,” the player added while laughing.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for "an unwarranted suspicion of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “the moral damage that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged case took place in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
Following a nightclub meeting with Ronaldo and Mayor, he allegedly went back to the player's hotel room where he was allegedly raped on the basis of documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
With Mayor, Ronaldo claims that, after the alleged incident, he fell on his knees and told him that he was a “99 percent good man”, of whom “one percent fails”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple's sexual relationship, but it was not unanimous.
The Mayor also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution, because he was afraid of “revenge” and was concerned about “public downgrading”.
Now a 34-year-old woman says that she is now trying to overturn the solution, as the alleged case continues to trauma her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United and joined Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved a giant Juve to Italy for a transaction of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The UK may regret to leave car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom ‘would regret it forever’, if it lost its position as the world’s automotive leader after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop their production in a plant near Derby in Burnaston.
We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border stoppages without Brexit agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My opinion is that when the UK starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop to the production process at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also been afraid to leave the EU without an agreement, concerned about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for one month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the risks in the supply chain in the absence of the Brexit agreement.
The Toyota production line works as needed, with spare parts coming from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement signed on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to hold more than one day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, so production would have to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers’ plan for the future of the EU is “exactly calibrated to avoid such checks at the border.”
We need an agreement. We want the best solution that will allow us to do what we want, and not just take advantage of the current success, but take advantage of the whole opportunity,” he said to BBC Radio 4 Today.
Evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the long run warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately pay jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a member of the United Trade Union, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from experience that if jobs disappear, they will not come back.
The government’s spokesperson said: “We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week, as the fight against the highest-ranking candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein is following the work of Commissioner Robert Mueller, who is investigating the intervention of the Russian elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy Prosecutor General and thus threaten Mueller's independence has sparked Washington's rumours for several months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein did not confirm this.
But last Monday he went to the White House, announcing that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, then in New York at the UN.
Trump said he did not want to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid encountering the hearing of the Senate Panel of Judges, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both showed signs.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday in the Fox News news channel.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be delayed by another week, taking into account all the things that are underway in connection with the Supreme Court.
But let’s look at it and keep the press up to date, as always.”
Some journalists would dispute this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The presenter, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not the result of TV journalists' disappointment, although he added: “I do not dispute the fact that they have been frustrated.”
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president does more questions and answers sessions than any president before him,” he said, without adding any evidence: “We have looked at these numbers.”
The briefings continue, Sanders confirmed, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot of this and you have seen how we have done it in the last few weeks, so this will happen during the press conference, if you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or by attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, having gathered in front of journalists in the freeway and sometimes with a strange look .
Health Minister wrote to EU staff NHS in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and desire to be present after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent her letter if less than six months remain until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of the well-established status of EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, heading towards the expected decisions of this autumn.
However, the UK government has also made preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to repeat now how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his or her nationality.
Compatriots from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christopher Abercrombie, a supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency surgery after Saturday's head injury and defeat at 31:27 Vanderbilt Commodores, released by the Tennessee Mike Organ.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury happened just before the half-time.
He fell on his side and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen on their side before being placed on a stretcher to be removed from the field for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that the Abercrombie operation from Vanderbilt at the Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that there are no details about the type/scope of the injury yet, and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red-shirt student of the second year, was in his first season at the Tennessee State after coming over from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, which made a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This step will dissuade Corbyn from trying to attract young voters
The stamp duty is levied on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will create up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty rate if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The movement is considered to be an attempt to dissuade Jeremy Corbyn from trying to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable housing and target high-income people.
The stamp duty is levied on individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK, directing additional money to the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The surcharge - which is in addition to this stamp duty, including the higher levels established two years ago for the second home and onward purchase - can be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will create up to 120 million pounds a year.
The property is owned by 13% of the London properties purchased by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet down when acquiring housing.
Many of the wealthy regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become “ghost cities” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when they buy land but do not use it, and called on May to give up quotas for affordable homes to remedy the UK's "housing shame".
Corbyn has announced the reform of eye-catching housing, including rent control and the cessation of the scourge of innocent people.
He also wants to give councils greater powers in the construction of new homes.
May said: "I promised last year that I would be committed as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
At the same time, it is right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as it is for foreign companies to buy homes as it is for British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far away, and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is Scotland’s leadership”
Jack Ross, Sunderlan’s leader, says that his “final goal” is to become the head of Scotland at some point.
The Scottishman (42) welcomes the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, currently ranked third in League One, with only 3 points behind.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Champions League last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I reached class B and it was limited to that,” said Ross to the BBC Scotland show Sportsound.
But I grew up with my father in Hampden, Scotland, and this is always something that has pulled me back.
However, this opportunity comes only if I am successful in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's leader have been Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid of such big and well-known names, having previously endured both in Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success at the moment is if I can take this club to the Champions League.”
Because of its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Champions League,” he said.
It is not an easy task to get there, but I see myself successful only if I manage to take the club back there.”
Ross has worked as a manager for only three years, previously being Dumbarton's deputy director and 15 months among the staff in charge of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the fall to the third level and turned St Mirren's lowest position into the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical during his career.
This was a real crossroads,” he recalled the takeover of Alloa.
I really believed that management is more suitable for me than playing.
It seems strange because I managed, got a reasonable income and enjoyed some highlights.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things that need to be done weekly.
I still experience this in the light of the tension and pressure of my work, but the management just seems to be the right one.
I have always wanted to drive and now I am doing it. I feel more comfortable now than ever in adulthood.”

According to the study, the best time for pint is at 17.30 on Saturday.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of pubs in the British trouble, but the pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the turnover of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, representative of the business consulting company CGA, compiled these figures: “The continuing sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was similar to June when the turnover of the pubs increased by 2.8%, except that it went even harder on restaurants.
Trade in restaurants fell by 1.8% in June, which worsened even more in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded the most successfully and the restaurants trying to please the least.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant keepers.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales of beverages increased by 6.6% during the month between managed pubs and bars, while sales of food decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the fall in sales by 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide some essential relief.”
The increase in the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing down of the institutions involved in the brand.
The sales monitor of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 activity groups with a total turnover above GBP 9 billion, and is a well-established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
The survey found that one in five children, some of them 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A study conducted among 20 000 high school students found the growth of “fake Insta” leaves
News heightened fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a “core account” for showing parents
The survey came to the conclusion that one in five, some of them only 11, creates secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study conducted among 20 000 high school students found a significant increase in fake Insta accounts (reference to the image sharing page of Instagram).
The news heightened the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said that they had both a “fundamental account” for showing parents and a “fundamental account” that they had accepted.
One of the discoverers of his 13-year-old daughter's secret page saw that the teenager invited others to rape himself.
Digital Awareness UK and Headsmasters and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half of them acknowledged the existence of personal accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing to see so many teenagers lured into creating accounts online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes a protagonist of athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director at the annual board meeting of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most acclaimed track and field athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described this as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience over the last decade.
Eilidh is respected everywhere in Scotland, the UK and other sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from inviting him to leadership,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a proponent of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to Scottish sport and contribute to its development."
An American who won a total of four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics at 200 metres and 400 metres, and now often shares his opinion in the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that if I recover, and if so to what extent, only time will show.
I have done a lot of hard work, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and already do speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertising, which compares women with cows, divides the internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the Internet with two hosts of advertisements comparing the nursing mother with milking cows.
According to the stories, to present the world’s first silent breast pump, Elvie, a consumer-oriented technology company, published an ironic music video-like advertisement to present the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who want to live out.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with their cows and sing: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see my tail” and “If you didn’t notice, they’re not udders, they’re my breasts.”
Repeated verse: “Pump, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has given rise to conflicting views on the Internet.
77 000 video viewers with thousands of comments are dissenting, many of them say that it illuminates the behind the tents of the dairy industry.
The use of cows to promote this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that children are stolen from them in a number of days after birth,” wrote one.
Elvie breast pump does not stand out from the nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “I understandably traumatize both mother and child.
But why not use these babies to promote the breast pump of mothers who can keep them?"
Someone added: A completely incomprehensible advertisement.”
Part of it is in favour of advertising. A woman considered it a great deal of fun.
I think it is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I were still breast-feeding.
Pumping milk made me feel completely cowy.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but let's take it as it is.
This is a brilliant product,” wrote one.
The second commented: “This is a fun advertisement (often in their workplaces or in their toilets) for pumping mothers who feel like cows.
This advertisement neither praises nor condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all danced in bras with non-visible pumps.
The idea of the campaign is based on what has been said that many women pumping milk from the breast feel like a cow.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and does not stand out from the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even go outdoors when pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Ana Balar commented: "Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and irritating introduction.
With female expression and comparison of dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the pumping of the breast and all its challenges, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary sense of freedom created by the new pump.
This is not the first time the news has reflected the Elvie pump.
At the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children carrying the designer Marta Jakubowski appeared on the scene.
Thousands of migrant children went quietly to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children arrested has risen sharply, although monthly crossings have remained quite the same, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies enforced by Trump's administrator have made it difficult to set up children with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and are afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country, for which they require the child's right of custody.
The risk increased in June, when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could present fingerprints and data are shared with immigration agencies.
The senior immigration and customs officer, Matthew Albence, admitted to Congress last week that the agency arrested a dozen people who applied for financial support not for accompanying minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Almost 80 per cent of sponsors or members of the sponsors’ household are staying illegally in the country and a large number of them are from criminal backgrounds.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue them,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials enforced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest.
Many protect their legal content before the immigration judge by visiting instead.
Unsuitable for release will be quickly expelled from the country.
According to asylum workers, and based on the system reports published in recent months - the longer the child stays in custody, the more likely they will become nervous or depressed, which may cause violent demonstrations or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more relevant in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child's difficulty can be missed because of its size.
They added that moving children to tents without leaving enough time to get used to feelings or say good-bye to friends could lead to trauma, with which many are already in difficulty.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home in the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
According to Moulem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, the foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegally under the pretext of terrorist control and are being dealt with accordingly.
They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he said in the Assembly.
Moulem claimed that Syria’s “war on terror is almost over”. Since 2011, more than 360 000 people have died and millions more have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “the fight in this holy war until we have cleared the whole Syrian area” from both terrorist groups and “any outside force that is illegally present.”
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about war refugees, Moulem said that the conditions for their return are appropriate and he accused some Western countries of spreading the incomprehensible fears that prevent refugees from coming.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them in their lives,” he said.
They politicize something that is merely a humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given rehabilitation until there is a war-ending agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates the Idlib buffer zone in the last rebel support point, has created an opportunity to advance with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale raid on Syrian forces in a province with three million inhabitants.
However, Moulem stressed that the agreement had ‘explicit deadlines’ and expressed hope that military action would hit the jihadist, including Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front fighters, who would be ‘destroyed’.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convince the first meetings of a new Committee of members of the government and opposition to plan the post-war Syrian Constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moulem asked the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump is also elected for the second term
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if the dismissal and scandal had not previously ceased his presidency, as probably wanted by liberal viewers.
Which would undoubtedly be the most exciting end of the presidential office!
At the moment, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hourly ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak hours. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has risen. Over 3.5 million viewers on the MSNBC’s ‘The Rachel Maddow Show’ channel, its rating has been kept high during the main evening news.
This is the tension in which we are involved because we do not understand it,” said the head of ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor” about the Secretary of Government, who will become the President if the attack destroys the parliament building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced a comedy writer and a book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club,” the author, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The leader told him he was voting for Mr Trump.
Why?’ he asked
She said she was making me laugh,” Ms. Scovell told me.
All this chaos has an entertaining value.
Of course, not as other TV shows show, Washington's rumours can become fatal to the future of Roe v. Wade and to reunite with immigrant families and the global economy.
Leaving the subject aside is only the luxury of privileged viewers.
However, a six-hour expert talk show about Bob Woodward’s “in-depth background study” for his book “Fear” and Paul Manafort’s 13 225,73€ ostrich leather from Bomber jacket (Washington Post said “an overly cherished garment”) and Stormy Daniels’s thoughts on Mr. Trump’s anatomy’s gruesome description, the viewer is more than an educated citizen.
I, for example, never look at Super Mario with the same feeling again.
One of his activities, which may seem like a reality series, is that he shares something every night,” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the series “Pawnings” Brent Montgomery Trump with changing actors and daily plan pawns (nolling with NFL, praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a bit or you're out of time.
In Fleiss this week, his home on the northern shore of the Caucasus was 80 degrees warm, but he had escaped to the room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to give up watching Brett Kavanaugh cope in the Senate's Legal Committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hangs on the hair.
I remember making all sorts of crazy shows in my time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilisation,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Cash flows to the coolest White House sub-sampling elsewhere
It is no wonder that Division 17 of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow through the reorganisation of the Congress area, getting the two dominant companies in the same place.
As a result, the first number of the suburban district of Pittsburgh from the Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb was re-elected, winning a seat in the second district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
The opponent of the lamp is the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the previous Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were changed after the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January, which is why the old districts were divided into anti-constitutional electoral districts, favouring the Republicans.
The new 17th elections have been unleashed by a campaign in which the financial departments of the largest political parties – the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC) – are trumped with money.
The lamb became well known in Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in the extraordinary elections of the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been a republican for several decades and President Donald Trump won in division 20 points.
Political opinion-makers have given the democrat a small advantage.
US El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then retreated
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognised Beijing, which was a minor setback for Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump met in a friendly atmosphere with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Carlos Carlos, and held a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out Trump's company's administrative team.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall the American leaders of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, as the press spokesperson of the Ministry, Heather Nauert, earlier this month said that these countries had recently ceased to support Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was planned to be punished, which received $140 million in aid from America in 2017, including for drug surveillance, development and economic impetus.
The proposed sanctions, which included a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American state and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to organise a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a development in the effort to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and to conclude the debate on any punishments for El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence, who will speak in mid-October at a meeting to talk about the positions of the government, is now being evaluated.
And the three American ambassadors returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh announcements or penalties from Washington.
The spokesperson for the White House Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of what had been said by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions on the request to remain anonymous.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the request to remain anonymous.
Study history
Next, it may happen that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is publishing a report on the possible justice of Trump, which has a lot of evidence in the State Archives.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating whether the Trump campaign is related to Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change the party, Trump would have to report in this institution as if he were going to speak again to voters and perhaps even his peers with judges.
There are many things to do here, and I do not want to point out that the removal of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid subsequent years of massacres.
History goes around such inflections and the merciless march of democracy is getting closer or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What will we do if Trump unleashes the Deputy Director of the Prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that he proposed to secretly save the president last year and speculated on the inadequacy of that position.
Rosenstein says The Times statement is inaccurate.
How to respond if the newly requested investigation by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete and fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in favour of Congress in the mid-election if Trump is responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter holiday.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who once took over and used our ambassador's home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me a taillight of candles on a table with a hook.
With this legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rogers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the Battle of Vienna
The Rangers organizes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which was followed by an impressive draw previously received against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, will place them in a strong position to become the G-Group of the European League.
The knee injury did not allow the midfielder Graham Dorrans to play against Villarreal from the first appearance of the season before the 2:2 draw match, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better results.
This was a good point for us, because Villarreal has a strong opponent,” said a 31-year-old player.
We went into the game, believing that we could achieve something and left the game at a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but this was generally a fair result.
They were better at the first half of the game and we were better at the second half of the game.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a difficult game, because they got a good result in their last game, but since the people support us, I am sure that we can pull ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was hard, thanks to that, I was injured and changes took place inside the club, but now we all have a good sense of innerness.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, leave the previous season behind us and be successful.”
Women cannot sleep because of the fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
People want family members to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President for Life Insurance Activities at Nationwide.
This, however, should be started.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless they know your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these options can be extremely important in terms of costs.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan to pay for these costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid financial life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or proprietary self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles in the bud.
Get yourself a Health Service Credential to identify a Trustee to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow at your request if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a trustee in relation to your finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the little details: imagine that your old mother has an emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down these things so that you are ready if necessary.
This is not just a financial aspect, but it is also important who would be doctors?” Martin explained.
What medicines are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put it all in place.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported that the number of deaths was still increasing.
Since the bond has been broken, the rescuers have not received any information from the Donggala regent north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawes, located on the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, and its population was estimated at 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was suddenly hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala regents is an area extending over 300 km (180 miles) in the north-western part of Sulawes Island.
The administrative area under the province, Regents, was estimated to have 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawes, especially in the Donggala region.
Nickel mining, which is mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowal, Sulawes, is also important in the province.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, the tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996 the tsunami struck the west of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is situated on a seismic Pacific lighthouse and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, on 26 December in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-degree earthquake struck Indonesia's most populated island of Java from the south, creating a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck the area near Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Sumatra islands - the Mentawai Island, firing up to a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The deep earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the fatal earthquake of 2004 and the destruction brought by the tsunami.
The tsunami did not occur that time, but more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in trouble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, regarding suspicion of domestic violence, interference with reports on domestic violence, and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a female person tried to inform the police of alleged crimes, Palin took a phone from him.
Palin is held in a Mat-Su pre-investigation facility and held against $500 of unsecured bail, KTuu said.
He appeared on Saturday at the court where he declared that he was ‘not guilty in any way’, the news network announced
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanours, which means he can face up to a year of imprisonment and a fine of $250 000.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanour punishable by a one-day imprisonment and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been prosecuted.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, his mother, Sarah Palin, was called by the police.
The case is currently being discussed in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interference in the report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon, all in a state of intoxication.
His friend claimed that he hit him in the face.
The veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
The earthquake in Indonesia was followed by a tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake in Sulawes Island, Indonesia, on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the outskirts of Sulawes city centre, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos in the social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
At the time of Tsunami's capture, hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the beach of Palu.
At the NYC, federal prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack
The federal prosecutors of New York are seeking a death sentence against Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of having killed eight people in a New York terrorist attack, a rare punishment that has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used Home Depot's rental car to attack down the West Side road in Lower Manhattan by mowing both pedestrians and cyclists on their way in October.
According to the announcement of the death penalty in the southern part of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and also caused serious bodily injuries intentionally in order to justify the death penalty.
In both cases, judicial documents constitute a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury brought a 22-point charge against Saipov, which included eight murder charges, along with criminal offences commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “intense planning and premeditation”, the prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s actions as “suffering, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” he says in his announcement.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last death proceedings in the Southern District District of New York.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but as a result he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, New York, in 1953, when the couple was executed after being convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native Uzbek, reported a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he had told the investigators that he was happy about what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by ISIS videos viewed from his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He has not accepted the blame for the 22-point charge.
David Patton, a Saipov public defender said they were “manifestly disappointed” in the decision.
In our opinion, the decision to apply for the death penalty will prolong the trauma of all those involved, instead of taking the blame instead of life imprisonment without the possibility of being released,” said Patton.
Previously, Saipov's defence team asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
According to Tory, NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilise the People’s Army” during today’s Tory Conference protest.
The former head of UKIP said that politicians had to feel the “hotness” of Eurosceptics, as one of the members of Theresa May's own parliament recommended to lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative member of the House of Commons, said on a march in Birmingham that the UK would “be out by now” if Mr Farage were a Brexit secretary.
However, Mrs May is facing a problem with the reconciliation of her deeply divided lines, which were stressed by the conservatives who favoured staying, joining her own protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track among Brexit supporters, icers and EU attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite the counter-strike and force the Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their package and “chaose”.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave gathering in Solihull that he wanted to “opt out of Chequers’ plan”.
He recommended that Farage be accepted as a partner and be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
'It is his responsibility that we should be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough MEP added: “I stand outside for Brexit, but we have to abandon Chequers’ plan.”
Reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in the wars to be subordinate.
We want to create our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that public opinion has now changed since the 2016 vote: “The opinion that British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Tory Brexit's supporter, Andrea Jenkins, was also on the march and told the reporters: "I'll just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually go down the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening.”
With a message addressed to May, he added: “Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said that the politicians who were gathered had to be “hot” if they were planning to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class” he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that “we will not let that happen”.
In the message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class on the verge of Brexit feel uncomfortable.
We will mobilise the national army of this country, which has won us with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.”
At the same time, the icers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour gathering in the centre of the city.
A handful of activists waved “The Tories Against Brexit” slogans after the group was established this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Liberals blasphemed conservatives for the security issues that were involved in the opening of the conference for the application of their party.
These are people who say that IT systems can be put in place and all the technology can be moved to Canada and more, for smooth border crossings, for cross-border unrestricted trade to Ireland,” he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering the President of the Presidency
US Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering the presidency after the November elections
Boston Globe announces that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday in the Town Hall of Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will be running for the next election against GOP National Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that it may turn out to be an opponent of Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters in the town hall after Trump took office.
The presenter asked whether he was planning to apply for president.
Warren replied that "it's time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, that is to say, on the frontrunner."
The LSU Sims shooting was arrested
LA Police at Baton Rouge announced on Saturday that a suspect of the shooting of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims had been arrested.
Baton Rouge police forces announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson around 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They unveiled a video of a Friday shooting, asking for help on the footage to identify the visible man.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
Wayde Sims received a shot in the head and died as a result,” said the police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, 247 sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, having a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge police station.
Nearly 2 meters young Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them in the original formation, on average 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Cup after being awarded with team records over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment on, it became clear that Valter's Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the order of the Mercedes team played a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost neglected Hamilton when he defended his position for the first two times and called on Vettel to attack his teammate.
The water went first to the booth stops and left the rear end of the Hamilton group in heavy traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the stand later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went to lead after being side by side, when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left it free to pass the inner side after trying to protect it with a double move on the third bend.
Max Verstappen started the competition from the back row of the grid and was seventh in the end of the first round for his 21-year birthday.
He then ran the competition for most of the time, driving the rubbers to the finish line and passed Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He finally drove to the booth stop on the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed with the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen the fourth place.
Today is a hard day, because Valtteri worked hard all week and was a real gentleman by letting me pass.
The team has done a great job to have one of the two,” said Hamilton.
It was a very poor body language
President Donald Trump ousted Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday gathering due to an incident that he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the West Virginia assembly, the president did not address the testimony given by Ford directly to the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, but instead he commented on what was going on in the Senate, which showed that people were “evil, dishonest and deceitful”.
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that is happening in the Senate in a few days is that you see anger and angry, mean, disgusted and false people,” he said.
When you look at the press releases and the leaks they say: “Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn’t do it.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you leak the document?” – “Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not leak.”
Wait a minute.
Did we leak ... no, we didn’t leak,” he added with the senator’s appearance.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein about the charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill said: “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” Feinstein said to the Committee.
He asked me to maintain confidentiality, and I did so at his request.
But his denial did not suit the president who commented during the Saturday gathering: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but it’s one of the worst body languages I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct on the part of three women, the President suggested that the democrats would use these accusations for their own purposes.
They have decided to take back the power without choosing the means.
You can see this viciousness and disgust, and they don’t care who they hurt, who they need to drive over to gain power and leadership,” the Mediate President said.
elite league: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giants Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
Dundee Stars defeated Belfast Giants, who lost to Dundee 5:3 at the Friday elite league reunion on Saturday.
Giants started to run the game early with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie before Dwyer led Giants again.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
It was the third loss for Adam Keefe's men in the elite league. They came to Belfast on Friday night to win Dundee as of 2:1.
This was the fourth meeting of half of the season, with Giants winning three previous games.
The opening gate of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaulli and David Rutherford, when Beauvillier doubled his head start four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back to the game in the fast first third of 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie score a fig goal in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured that Giants would lead before the first break, hitting the second goal of his evening at the end of the first third.
On the home field, players regrouped and Bouchard set them back to the level, hitting a numerically predominance at the minute of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time at the end of the second third of the game, securing a victory for the last third of their team in the attack zone.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of people from earthquakes
One Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe take-off of hundreds of planes carrying people.
The major earthquake that struck Sulawes on Friday caused a tsunami, resulting in the death of more than 800 people, many of whom have been missing.
The area is harassed by strong aftershocks and many people are trapped under ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his 21-year-old colleagues fled the fluctuating air tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufr Airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on duty to ensure safe take-off of Batik Air flight 6321, which was at the same time on the runway.
He then jumped out of the air tower, thinking it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia announced ABC News.
We set up a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to another major hospital in the city.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
We were extremely sad when we heard about it.” added the spokesperson.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to thousands, according to the state disaster relief agency, access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the Agency’s spokesperson, said: “The number of deaths may increase, as the bodies of many victims are still under ruins and have not been saved.”
The six-metre waves destroyed the town of Palu, where mass burial takes place on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "An ambulance will make new sacrifices every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we can't tell them what they can find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "Please work night and day to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this?” CNN said.
In early this year, more than 550 people were killed in an earthquake in the Indonesian city of Lombok.
Micronesia accident: Air Niugin's airline claims that one man has disappeared after the lagoon crash
Although it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft, the airline now claims that the aircraft that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia has disappeared.
Air Niugini said in his statement that from Saturday afternoon they were unable to find one male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to passenger details, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said that the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was crossing the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane was very low when it landed.
That’s very good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to doubt the water at the waist of the submerged plane to the emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicking and yelling and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy and the sailors who were working on a nearby berth also helped to rescue by using inflatable boats to take people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres.
Data from the aviation safety network show that 111 people have died during the last two decades in aircraft accidents involving air carriers registered to PNG, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analyst prepares a schedule for the evening when the woman was burned
The Public Prosecutor's Office closed the case on Saturday for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the United States Department of Justice, spent several hours as an expert observer in intelligence analysis.
He pointed out to the jury how he used mobile phone records to recreate the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night that she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he had received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Brick had, together with Chambers, the night the girl died, which was contrary to the young man's previous claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in town that day.
When the accusers asked him whether Tell had told the truth when he said that he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tell was "wrong because my car was in Nashville".
Another mismatch was that Brick said he had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, he deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
He erased the girl from his life,” said Hale.
Defence is planning to make its own speech on Sunday.
The judge said he thought that the case would be heard by the jury in the same half of the day.
The High Breed: What is a Conscious Hip hop?
Hiphop trio wants to fight the negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has departed from the beginnings of its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the hip hop roots and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in the UK thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York babysitter complains about a racist message after a couple of court cases
The New York Babysitter sues for a discriminatory dismissal after a couple of messages accidentally received from the family, where the mother complained that the babysitter is “another black person”.
A couple denies that they are racists compared to the situation with excerpts.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed his displeasure when she learned that their new childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband a message saying: “EIIIIII, yet another Black.”
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Princess Maurice.
According to New York Post, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman, after understanding his prom, unleashed Maurice, claiming that their sociable babysitter, who was an African American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for a Filipino instead of him.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for dismissal, which he wants to receive on a daily basis in the amount of $350 for the next six months, and the same work he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
I want to show them to look, so do,” he said to The Post, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple has rejected the claim that they were racists, saying that the termination of their relationship with Maurice was a reasonable act because they feared that they could no longer trust him after insulting her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
He is not a race.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco, wife, said to The Post.
But would you give your children to keep a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was involuntary?
Your newborn?
Come on.”
Commenting on the comparison with excrement, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was in a “very difficult situation”.
Would you go against someone like that?
This is not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the case is still ongoing, the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple in social media, where they are severely criticised for their behaviour and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not be in touch with the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said: "It is difficult to put herself in the shoes of a person who read it for the first time before publication.
It is very fun now to know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He said that his father, having inspired him to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about his rejection of his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was with a sad image due to his father's death last year.
On Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family”, he also added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
He was a rather quiet man and was not a proud person,” he said.
But since Paddington was so real for him, it was as if your child achieved something: you are proud of them, even though this is not your achievement.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and vision, he always recognized Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say good-bye to her over the phone
When he landed, his daughter was rushed to Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked unnecessarily to save his life.
They regularly called to say that the daughter's condition was very bad and that they did not believe that she would survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nadi, who said that my daughter would die in two minutes, and I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did it.
I said, “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
See you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medicines that the doctors gave him to keep cutting his heart off were slowly disappearing and leaving his body.
He was dead a little before that and now the work of all the systems started to stop.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what would happen.
I could not howl, yell or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who now mourned her daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who knew nothing about her experiences.
No one knew that,” he said.
I kept my head down, and tears flowed all this time.
This is difficult to explain, but I felt a terrible outburst of sympathy for Nadia on this flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.”
Postcards of a grieving woman prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved suicide nails work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have stuck maps on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
The son of Miss Davis, Tyler, was 13 when she suffered from depression, and 18 when she killed herself.
I don’t want no parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile makes the whole room shine.”
However, he stopped working before his death because he was “in a very bad place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his life.
Mrs Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that it has a domino effect.”
Ms Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with her friend.
Don’t shut up – you need to talk.”
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend with Ms Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year partner, not long after the death of her husband's mother.
He did not say that he felt bad or was depressed or anything,” he said.
We noticed a change in his behaviour a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
Ms. Humphreys said that the death of a man was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: “It tears the wound into the whole family.
It tears us apart.
But we must move forward and continue the fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on the hair while the FBI starts investigating
I believed that if we could actually get what he wanted – a limited investigation of time and scope – we might be able to achieve unity,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee would “fall apart” in the middle of a steady partisan deadlock.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate this?
Their reluctance was due to the timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November. If the Republicans do not go well as expected, they will be visibly weakened in their intentions to get the man they want at the top of the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbying to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr Bush in the White House, and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to vote decisively and to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korean troopers are “decreasing” under Kim's government
South Korean legislation has said that the number of North Korean troopers to South Korea has been decreasing since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Harmonisation, said that compared to the 2011 military runners (2706), their number had decreased last year (1127).
Mr Park said that the key factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
South Korean citizenship has been offered to a large number of North Runners.
Seoul magazine claims that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily demilitarised area between two Koreas.
China takes runners as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back home with force.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still technically at war, has significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of nuclear weapons that had stopped.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally promised to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of lack of progress in sanctions.
Without trusting the United States, our country lacks security security, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to unilaterally disarm ourselves,” said Mr. Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh ‘hysterical’ and said that the man was unfit for justice at the Supreme Court.
The opposition leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as ‘hysterical’ and said that the man was a mercifully unfit to serve as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi expressed his opinion during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I noticed that if a woman had done this, she would have been called hysterical,” said Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony given to the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusation that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, describing his family and years of high school, he occasionally almost yelled and was sometimes speechless.
He also explicitly condemned the members of the Committee of the Democratic Party, calling the indictment against him of the 2016 pre-trial defeat of Hillary Clinton as a 'grotesque and coordinated reputational murder' of angry liberals.
According to Pelos, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man is unfit for justice at the Supreme Court because it showed that he is biased against the democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the democrats,” he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked whether he would try to remove him from office if Kavanaugh had confirmed his approval, if the democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
I say so much – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he will not only be a judge at the Supreme Court, but he will also not be a judge at the court where he is currently working,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal in Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, he is concerned about possible decisions against the Kavanaugh Affordable Care Act (Health Act – translator’s note) or Roe v. Wade (legal precedent for abortion – translator’s note), as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation session, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court rulings.
Now is not the time when a hysterical biased person could become a judge and expect us to say that it is not nice,” said Pelosi.
And women have to wear it.
It is a fair expression, an over-boiling anger of months and years, and it cannot escape without weeping it.
We cry when we get angry,” Ms Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, do I?
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was a manager somewhere; she said that she was crying too when she got angry, but she developed a method that consisted in saying that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, “You might think I was crying because I was sad.
I am angry.”
And he just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partly perceived as the output of rage because they are misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is in an office where I found myself crying in an indescribable rage when an older woman – a strict leader I had always been a little afraid of – grabbed me from the collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Don’t ever show them how weeping,” he told me.
They do not know that you are furious.
They think you’re sad and that’s what gives them satisfaction.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Congressman of the Democratic Party from Colorado, had worked together with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital love story on board a yacht named Monkey Business and ended the campaign, deeply upset Schroeder thought that there was no reason why he should not think about becoming president on his own.
It was not a well-thought-out decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
Seven candidates were already candidates and the last thing they needed was to join someone else.”
Someone said it was like Snow White and seven dwarfs.”
As the campaign was coming to an end, he was late for fundraising, and he promised not to stand if he did not get a total of two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who donated 1000 dollars to men gave him just 250 dollars.
“Do they think I get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave a speech in which he announced that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so anointed by the feelings of gratitude for the people who supported him, the irritability towards the system, which made it difficult to turn to the voters instead of collecting money and delegates, and the anger against sexism, that he came with tears in his throat.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press against him.
I would have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they write on my tombstone.
“He cried?”
How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening bangs of the US-China trade war were lamenting, and although the battle is far from over, according to experts, the gap between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, issued the first warning round this year, imposing taxes on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200bn (£150bn), effectively imposing taxes on the parties to the Chinese imports into the US.
Beijing has responded the same every time, with the latest $60bn worth of American goods at five to ten percent tariffs.
China has promised the United States to give a shot at it, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to blink soon.
Getting back to Washington would mean succumbing to the demands, but publicly worshipping before the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that, if Beijing correctly points out its maps, the trade war with the US can support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that cause the economy to lose control in another country is actually much more dangerous than the bystanders have previously acknowledged,” said Researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on researching Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready for the return of refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
When speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
Currently, the situation on the territory of the country is more stable and secure due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to bring back normality.
There are now all the conditions for refugees leaving the country voluntarily to return to the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting everyday life and livelihoods.
According to the UN forecast, 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war that began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe reached the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team at the Le Golf National Golf Course near Paris in France with a final score of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the Danish team of Captain Thomas Bjorn gained 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, a US star who was all over the tournament, swung a team strike on the par-3 track into 16 waters, giving up his victory over Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who has achieved 5:0:0 in the current format that began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was scored 5&4 by Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest-placed Dane of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, beat Ian Poulter, 2 and 1, who might have won the Ryder Cup last.
The eight veterans of the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European in all time with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold myself back.
It has been a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
It’s about team spirit and I’m glad I was able to help,” said emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
He will pass the torch on to the amateur Jon Rahm, who won US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
I am extremely proud that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has the result of the Ryder Cup 13:21:3.
The strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who have won the 14 Grand Cup titles, laging behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was caught up in finding fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the crew's disappointment, "I'm proud of the guys, they were bold.
There were moments in the morning when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought them.
Hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
The hat should be lifted.
We were better played.”
New information on water blooms: Concentrations decreased in Pinella, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows an overall reduction in the concentration of flowering algae in the area of the Bay of Tampa.
According to the FWC, there are reports of a more patchy bloom in the regions of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating decreasing concentrations.
The extent of water bloom is about 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
Spots can be found 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer places than last week.
Water blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the average concentration on the coast or on the high seas in Pinellas County, the low to high concentrations on the high seas in Hillsborough County, the background to high concentrations in Manatee County, the background to high concentrations in Sarasota County and on the high seas, the background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, the background to high concentrations in Lee County and on the high seas, and the low concentrations in Collier County have been reported.
The regions of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier continue to report respiratory distress.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida in the past week.
