Four members of the Kemerovo Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld in Spain, who is known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevich, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
According to suspicion, they are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organisation between the ages of 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
An alleged leader of a criminal organisation was detained in Mijas, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia, one of whom is the leading figure of the criminal organisation according to the collected data, and two are members of the criminal organisation.
The data collected suggests that the responsibilities and roles of the criminal community were clearly shared.
The aim of the criminal organisation was to commit drug crimes and thereby earn criminal proceeds," commented Vahur Verte, the head of the criminal proceedings, the Prosecutor General.
We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this case," the Prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously become interested in law enforcement agencies, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues had been important throughout the investigation.
International cooperation has become common for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," said Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that the detentions were preceded by a criminal investigation that lasted nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was real, and at the same time we detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that the officials of the Central Criminal Police were of help in detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civil guard.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we can get them from the other side of Europe,” said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that, while at large, suspects may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for him to be surrendered to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation in this criminal case.
The pre-trial proceedings in the criminal matter are conducted by the Office of Crimes Organised by the Central Criminal Police and are conducted by the Office of the Prosecutor General.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered to be the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich from Kemerovo emerged in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s, when he began to deal with problems in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and judgments that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the so-called Dikayev Criminal Society, eight defendants who were confiscated for €80 000, or the conviction of nine persons that Igor Aleynikov established a criminal organisation in 2006 aimed at illegal trafficking of secret cigarettes and crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Ida-Virumaa and Southern Estonia.
The amount of criminal proceeds confiscated there is close to 71 500 euros.
In these criminal cases, the fact that police officers exchange information and evidence with their foreign colleagues every day has been a success and, if necessary, action is taken together in any European Union country.
Civil Rights Group warns against travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned non-residents travelling to Missouri about the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement states: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all African-American travellers, visitors and Missourins to be particularly alert and extremely cautious when travelling around the state, given the dubious race-based events that have recently taken place across the state and brought out here."
According to the NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning, both by the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, and by the fact that the targets of state law enforcement are, to a large extent, by minorities.
People's civil rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the side of the road because of their skin colour, being beaten or killed," said the President of the NAACP Missouri branch, Rod Chapel, to The Kansas City Star.
We have never received such complaints before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards students from Missouri University and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances at the beginning of this year after he ran out of petrol while passing through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the remark refers to a recent report prepared by the Attorney General of Missouri, which shows that in the state, car drivers of black cars are 75% more likely to be stopped than white ones.
The comment is intended to make people aware of and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
People must be prepared, whether it means taking bail or informing relatives that they are passing through the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state in 16th place in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
A travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for a company to sue for discrimination in housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACL) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, because, according to ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have started using this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C have a malignant effect, which may progress to liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver wrinkling and liver cancer.
The epidemiology advisor of the Health Board, Mr. Kuullo Kutsar, says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and skin and mucous membranes.
The last characteristic of the disease is also the common name of inflammation of the liver, jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can progress without signs of disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be identified based on laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can transition to chronic hepatitis and go through decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous liver disease.
Kuulo Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, by the excrement of an infected person and by hands to food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth and consuming drugs.
A family members and caregivers of people at risk of hepatitis infection, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected people, men having sex with men, drug users, travellers travelling to countries with a high spread of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination is recommended for people at high risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before you eat.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using household items that are contaminated with blood (toothbrushes, shaves), sex with donor blood, a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a hepatitis patient mother to a foetus/newborn child.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health, rescue workers and police personnel in contact with blood and other body fluids, and travellers to countries with high hepatitis B disease.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other prevention measures for hepatitis B include: refraining from using other hygiene and manicure products, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and using condoms for infection-prone sex, or preventing sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation programme in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using domestic objects contaminated with blood, sexing with donor blood, a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a hepatitis patient mother to a foetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family and caregivers, health care, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other body fluids, people with HIV and travellers to countries with high hepatitis C disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: prevention of the use of unfamiliar hygiene and manicure products, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms for infection-prone sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread by contact with blood and other body fluids, injection needles contaminated with them, sexually transmitted and rarely transmitted from the infected mother to the foetus.
People at risk of hepatitis D are chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus and people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects against infection with hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread via faecal-oral drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and shellfish, donor blood, single-dose syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Passengers may be infected with E in countries with high disease rates.
Preventive measures for hepatitis E are to comply with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the sick.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid using drugs.
In the final round, although competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength on the final line and won with time 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, after the finish, pulling along with his wife Tania and the children.
This was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be on the track with them,” Farah said to the journalists.
Farah targets the fifth title competition in London in 5000 and 10 000 meters in a row in a golden double.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "A Lady in Gold, an extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's portrait, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer" dives much deeper into the cultural life of Vienna at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
But even more in more detail in history.
The awe-inspiring amount of information might have been used up by a tighter axe, the narrower theme would have allowed the title to have more impact on the promised extraordinary story.
At the moment, there are two books between the covers: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in his painting "Damn in Gold", and a much larger and more comprehensive history of respectable Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftereffects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to a vibrant cultural life in Vienna, and who has come to the capital of Austria can easily imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around Ringstrasse or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Café when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the name in the book, you feel like a gramme more culturally.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where there was an incurable syphilis and the highest level of suicides in Europe, as if the story did not add anything to the development.
Or perhaps - each pair of strokes adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
During the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews had grown explosively in Vienna, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten inhabitants of Vienna were Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married Ferdinand Bloch, a Czech sugar magnate, and posing to Klimt for his famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele was not drawn by the glamorous life to which he belonged.
When you look at the "Gold Lady", it is hard to believe that at the end of his life this grand lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest portrait in Vienna.
At that time, Klimt’s order cost 4000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a good location in a country house.
The fact that in some portraits the master's love story with the model was suspected did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certainty is that the relationship between the model and the artist in the course of work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "A Lady in Gold.
A portrait of Gustav Klimt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before working with Adele, Klimt had visited the San Vitale basilica in Ravenna, and researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics from Empress Theodora that were seen there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his Lady in gold in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time (from 1907-1908) another golden painting was born in the "Kiss".
The similarity between the two women did not go unnoticed by art historians.
How is Hitler involved in the story?
In memory of my friend Klimt, I am indebted to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) and wished their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had a second portrait of Adele.
In his will (Adele left in February 1925) he also asked his husband to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
She inherited her jewellery to her nieces Maria and Luis.
One year after Klimt had finished "Austrian Mona Lisa", 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed the drawing exam.
Although sometimes Hitler's subsequent anti-Semitism is attributed to the fact that he was not accepted to the Academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were in fact Jewish.
In any case, the mission of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria’s will, had changed considerably by 1939 – finding the works of the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna for the Nazi Party had become important.
Some of Adele's work at home was also suitable for Hitler's personal art store, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the abduction of the Nazis, a 10-year dispute between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauers began.
It should only be noted here that if "Kiss" is seen in the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer in the "Gold of the Lady" must be seen in the New York Neue Galeria.
And read the aforementioned book before driving to Vienna.
Even if you do not plan to go to see Klimt's works, because at least my emotions revolved around the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for more than $135 million after the book was closed.
So not so much a portrait, rather a fate story of the family - and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree at the beginning of the book made it considerably easier to orientate events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
Gold was very close to his 200 m back swimming personal record while swimming at 2.16.62.
The top mark dates back to a 17-year-old peak a week ago, when the Canadian Junior Championship was 2.16.58, Priit mediates Aavik’s swimming blog.
Gold was the last one to make it to the A-Final.
In the final, he went through the distance with a time of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new high-end stamp.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15.13) remained with Gold for a little over half a second.
In Estonia’s all-time ranking, Gold rose to third and his fresh personal top brand is the fifth result of Estonia’s all-time.
The young hope for the future is still taking off in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming in the Canadian adult championships.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championship took place in Toronto, and Gold also made successful launches there.
He won a silver medal in 200 m freestyle with a time of 2.03,22.
This was the last time this distance was flooded by an Estonian woman in 2008.
Only Elina Partõka, a record-breaking Estonian woman, has been swimming in Estonia faster than Gold.
The Estonian woman living in Canada won a bronze medal in 100 metres of freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season’s top mark of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, who is a year older than her, has been swimming in this area only one hundred years faster.
He reached the top mark of his personal career in the 100 m back swim, receiving a record of 1.03.69 at the opening of the swim.
At half the distance, he won only the seventh place when he was swimming in the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season rankings on four different distances.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics sharpen their teeth
The vacation time is here - that is, relaxation for the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the presidents who took the most holidays out, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to Today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day holiday in his own-name golf club, Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday started yesterday, Trump's opponents have been speaking about the holiday for a week.
They are reproaching Trump too often to rest.
Namely, the President has a tradition of spending time in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey on weekends.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 working days.
For example, George W. Bush had already been on holiday for 67 days, Barack Obama for half as many as Trump for 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things quickly.
Counted days after becoming president, Trump said in the show "60 minutes" that there is no time for long vacations during his term of office, as much needs to be done.
He also expressed his displeasure about Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current president then wrote on Twitter: "When Obama is on holiday, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS cut heads off journalists."
According to the White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not exactly any relaxation.
This is officially called a work leave, during which Trump does not have time for reading or other favourite activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working leave.
Namely, in the western wing of the White House, the air conditioning system was replaced and therefore all personnel had to leave it.
In the West Wing, there is also the Oval Office and other premises of the President.
I don't think any of you would like to be in the west wing in August, if there are 38 degrees and no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, spokesperson for the White House, who stressed that the president would continue to work during the holiday.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you will get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook  do not apply for public office if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew a lot about the unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to get to him from internal politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "free speech can be taken away from us, and silently and silently, we can be led to slaughter like sheep."
This brings me to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And in the beginning of the week, he was therefore sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The governor's officials stamped the action null and void, and the online comments were full of counter-reactions in the style of "Who cares?".
It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does matter.
And it matters particularly much when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
Its approval percentage ranks second best among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an unthinkable reactive windhead.
He has commanded the state firmly and remained strictly firm in his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook rather adeptly as the main tool in communicating with his voters, for example, presenting his bald head happily after the first time in chemistry.
Thus, blocking people visiting the Governor’s page Ö which is an officially labelled public forum managed by staff paid from taxpayers’ dollars Ö is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behaviour in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderating.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of web-smarting internet trolls, spammers or a people full of anger.
The Post talked to a number of real people who Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are  real people who communicate with their chosen leaders, teachers, business owners and pastors, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and at all not foul.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Maryland, did not incite anger, but about real hate crimes.
I politely commented that I am disappointed that he has not reacted to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in the commentary section of The Post's news story.
I also do not like the idea that when a large number of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it a collective effort indifferently, rather than admitting that it is a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor's officials called a "targeted spam attack" would probably be called "public support".
The Facebook era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking the critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days, when workers had to be sent out to do the same, so that they would gather the newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for teething Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have blocked him from the Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark judgments on this matter was handed down last week in Virginia.
U.S. Chief Justice James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the Chairwoman of Loudoun County Supervisory Board violated the first amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) also visited Kentucky for the use of ACLU Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be that difficult.
During Washington, affordable postage costs had a similar effect as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled and anonymous writers thwarted his way of running.
And even then, Washington had to face anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington's decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents gathered in the context of the online George Washington letter collection project, he was buried in petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with the United Kingdom.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, differences of opinion and discussions are fundamental to our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to the comfort of his home territory at Renaissance Club
The former European leader, Ronan Rafferty, hopes for the comfort of his home territory in the next three days, when the 25th Scottish Senior Open will take place at the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern Irishman, who was leading the last lap on the nearby Archerfield Links trails before his inauguration to Paul Eales last year, is fond of the new venue and instead of the founder and CEO of the club, Jerry Sarvid, he plays the role of a member of the tournament.
I saw the Renaissance Club built, and now we see the club shine with this event in all its glory," said Rafferty.
"The players see the track in its best form, it is in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done an excellent job in building this place.
He is an enthusiastic supporter of golfing and is proud of what has been achieved here.
This allows you to present the trail perfectly."
The Englishman Eales looks forward to defending the title for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
This is accompanied by a very special feeling," said Southport's nesting player.
I could not defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off the competition calendar one year after my victory.
It is magical to come back to this area.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
This was a very special time that we will always wear in our hearts."
Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour in the beginning of this year when he got 50, will return to the competition on the ground of his homeland.
It is his first event in Scotland after being part of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"To play at home is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh man Orr.
You want to perform well, but you also feel extra tension.
I have enjoyed playing again tremendously and shown quite a decent golf game.
I am satisfied with the progress that has been made so far."
Ian Woosnam, former champion of the Masters tournament, and Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty, will join the Trio.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the race fire, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free and the car parking costs 5 pounds per car with one passenger and 10 pounds per car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the gold-rich land of Indonesia
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she does not use a stove.
He even rarely uses a pot.
Located in a wooden cabin in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai Regiment of Papua Province, Indonesia, the housekeeper places a sweet potato called ‘nota’ directly on the fire pit in the local language.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the fire and gently skinned with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor  she does not have furniture  and at the same time she does her daily chores, for example, laundry washes with cloudy water from the nearby sex.
The role of the toilet is played by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since he is the youngest of the four women of his husband, he has not been appointed to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, late work can be dangerous  most men in the village are unemployed and many drink hard, and there are also soldiers here.
No one dares to visit after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a controversy-making referendum, in which only 1026 elderly were forced to vote in front of the occupying forces by hand.
The movement, which encouraged the Dutch to free themselves, quickly turned its fury against the government of Jakarta, which still keeps the region under its strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, so that the eastern part of the island remained in independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is both a remote and an abandoned place; to get here, you have to fly 90 minutes from the capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then go on a five-hour journey that makes you nauseous with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
A city of about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered with wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has turned different shades of yellow-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made a journey here, not to mention journalists, and almost no foreigners have come here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans of Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
Other changes also took place.
We were not used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to her colourful hand-woven peatman, dark blouse and bright skirt.
Before that, we only wore plant leaves on the body.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also a gold-rich land in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province with a population of about 153 000 in New Jersey, is the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined approximately USD 3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can pride itself on commercial wood resources worth an estimated USD 78 billion.
But these riches are the source of the suffering of the Papuans, as they result in the suffocating presence of the mighty Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid local military personnel and units around USD 20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 per officer.
Papuans' efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and deal with them ruthlessly.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 Papuas have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands belonging to the Papua tribes in the 1970s were a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested over 3900 peaceful protesters in the area.
The 2016 report of the Archbishopric of Bilbao, "We will lose everything", contains testimonies of previous year's atrocities, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly common) and peaceful brutal repression.
It is difficult to count the number of victims, because such incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened even more, as Papua's natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christian, but demographic change is due to the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from the populous islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes in Indonesia.
Jaava family canteens sell gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals cannot compete with them.
Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables cheaper than local Papuans on the traditional market," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province for work.
Indigenous Papuans  Papua Mama-Mama'd [women]  therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won 27 of Papua 29, including Paniai, on his way to the Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But Papua has changed very little and the locals feel deceived.
Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation of fulfilling our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, Paniai was struggling only two months after Jokowi took office in October at a low level.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs by the fire in Enarotal, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle out of darkness.
The troubled children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, drunken soldiers chased children and beat them with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot among the children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby building was set on fire and the next day things escalated even further.
About 1000 young men, women and children from Papua gathered to claim justice on the football field in front of the local police station and military control centre.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance of the Papua honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and imitated the birdsong.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military.
On the outbreak of resentment, a command was sent to the soldiers via internal radio. "If the crowd resists more than three times, let them down," it was said according to an official document, which has been seen by the TIME magazine, but which has not been issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the elder of the Kego Koto district of Enarotal, felt the danger and called for peace by asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he said to the TIME magazine on his brightly coloured wooden house on the balcony.
Kayame still does not know who was the shooter, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
There was a lot of people, there was a lot of noise," he adds.
Alfius Youw, a local man, was shot three times, according to his cousin, who saw him shooting.
I ran to him and looked through his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief police officer of Papua, Yotje Mende, told the reporters that he was only responsible for returning the security of his department, as it was attacked.
We must defend ourselves if we are to be killed," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesperson for the Papua Police in 2015.
This is a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and were heavily injured.
The news of the killings arrived in Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, where he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in Papua.
I want to solve this case now so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would set up an out-of-court mechanism to solve the crimes against human rights that have occurred.
But almost immediately, apologies followed.
Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
However, when speaking about the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of establishing a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything is settled by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the death of more than 1000 people in East Timor in the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Papua, including the Pania.
The families of the victims of Paniai adopted such claims with a grim distrust.
I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," said Yohanes.
I'm tired.
He says he still lives in fear years later.
I'm afraid," he says.
I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the Paniai people are afraid to dissect this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bury the four victims.
After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot the villagers of Paniai in the neighbouring region of Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when he entered into a dispute between the villagers and the head of the construction company, who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested on the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned the policemen, which the latter responded to with warning shots.
But according to the locals, the mobile brigade (the Indonesian military police) began shooting at the people, killing one person.
We were in a big panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said the 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives close to the hospital and saw the injured overwhelmed.
I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and the withdrawal of the police mobile brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the tribes of honey, mon, dani and damal living in the pale mid-mountain of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) - an army of rebels, which, according to them, protects the rights of Papua, by carrying out occasional attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the army has arrested Pania in recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people, under the pretext of "defence of the sovereignty of the state".
Some of them never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as a "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The small amount of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for the locals to buy.
Bread is the same as unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves Ö mainly sweet potatoes, plus a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each able to maintain four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10 000 Indonesian Rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality between the indigenous Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived a great deal since the opening of new flights to Nabire Airport has deepened.
The few jobs that exist go better for educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuas themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
Young people are not interested in visiting, because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, strict restrictions remain on foreign media.
Towards the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow the relevant practices", although they were given a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asian Department of Human Rights Watch, Jokow's election promises to lift the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
In Indonesia, new threats to journalists trying to report on Papua's most easterly restless provinces and Western Papua - visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a boring look at the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's close neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – spurred the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
The same countries have historically also supported the VPL.
Armanatha Nasir, spokesperson for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dismissed the group's allegations, saying to journalists in Jakarta: "Democratic order and freedom of the press still apply in Indonesia, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more attention from foreign governments.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by the country's human rights ambassador, Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people stopped their silence, according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but Papuans do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
Jokowi is a well-intentioned man, but he is surrounded by people involved in shooting Paniai," says Hobai, Chairman of the Council of Tribals.
He wants to tell Jokow that, in addition to the fact that the Paniai people are living under the threat of a predatory army, they suffer from poor education and health services in distress.
According to Gobai, Paniai's people, like other Papuans, consider their voice given to Jokow to be a debt he has to pay.
They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims were still able to cope with the last symbolic insurrection  they buried one of the victims’ bodies as a corpse and on land opposite the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be established, they will at least not allow those responsible to forget about their crimes.
One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
What else can we do?
The fire swallowed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time
On Friday, the fire swept through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee this 337 metre high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has destroyed a high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called Torch or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no damage was reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
We were sleeping and waking up on fire alarms and people yelling.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down to the 50th floor," told Reuters, who called himself George.
According to Dubai civil defence officials, firefighters cleared the flame at around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter to the victims.
This incident can again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of the investigation following the fire of the Torch Board in 2015, it was found that the most damage suffered was the decorative panels and insulation of the facades - the exterior.
The British police have said that they believe that the insulation and facade panels of the Grenfell Tower of London could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire there in June, which killed around 80 people.
See: these phones are likely to become a hit in autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were launched, and new hit phones are also expected to be available in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, marketing and sales director of Tele2, this year's flagships are characterised by innovative design, eye iris scanner, edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 was a great source of excitement in the world of technology, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales list.
Autumn allows even faster fast charging, more durable battery, higher quality camera and greater water and dust resistance to smart devices.
He added that according to the rumours, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict four top models that will probably conquer the sales rankings this year.
These four top models of smartphones will still be available in the supermarkets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach the store shelves in mid-September.
Rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it spread a lot.
If the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to the iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday would expect the new model to be completely different from previous ones.
Four colours have been mentioned: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple's design manager, JonyIve, demands that the new iPhone model look like a smooth glass.
The ceramic version of the iPhone has also been discussed.
In addition to the iris scanner, wireless charging and an even higher quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
Surely this is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-ordering for the all-new Galaxy Note 8 starts on 23 August.
A lot of rumours have leaked about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is reported that more is meant for business users, and the S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wide angle and the other a telephoto lens with a narrower field of vision.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first attempt, which is certainly comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
However, we look forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has launched three smartphones with Nokia 6 this year, there is still a shortage of their flagship, Nokia 8, which will be presented already on 16 August.
We expect Nokia to have a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display and a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, the new Nokia model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by Zeiss.
If Sony's solid flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
We are looking forward to a smartphone that is a bit more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with an equally good or better camera.
For the new Sony model, it has been speculated that its screen is at least six inches.
What brings in reality, we will be able to see soon, because traditionally Sony has published its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which this year will be held from 1 to 6 September.
According to the leaky transcripts of phone calls, Trump put pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post released transcripts of calls between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the heads of state of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, Trump made a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicising that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president complained about public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign on the promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and pledged that Mexico would pay for this project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees going to Australia was "laughterful", "dirty" and "dirty" and he claimed that the agreement that was made during Obama's government would make him look like a "dirty" because he had proposed a ban on refugees from resettlement to the United States.
Trump ended the call by informing Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant call of the day".
The Supreme Court did not consider the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of regular bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive rejecting the offer of OÜ MRP Linnaliinid in Tartu bus procurement, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of Tartu City Law Service.
This is a procurement for public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Tartu Circuit Court.
The Supreme Court did not take it into consideration.
Although social media complains that the noise from the weekend festival disturbs their sleep and the whole city is full of drunken holidaymakers, there are also many people who have no bad words about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I am even positively surprised that the shop was so polite!
I did not see any vagueness or rudeness.
Even I saw kindness," says the limelight Laine.
After all, it's nice to come, be and enjoy Pärnu, which is like a hibernation in the winter," he adds with joy.
The scorching bulge from the beach, Laine, does not disturb sleep.
While living in the city centre, he heard that music was played on the beach, now the music has not reached his home.
"But I hope I hear," he says gladly.
Agnes, who has also talked to Õhtuleht, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu – it will greatly help local merchants.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have come to the summer capital.
The party life does not interfere with the woman.
Although I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, it's nice that the beach has revived.
And it's nice that the people are moving and that's been the case three times already," says the woman.
It must have been a little worse the first time.
Then perhaps there were complaints, he thinks.
However, according to him, the excitement on the beach is common for the summer capitalists.
This weekend is a very good promotion for our small town,” says Harri, who is standing in the park.
His rhythm of life has not been embroiled by mells and riots either.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Consider how this international communication would be better.
A lot of music does not crumble a man.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live there close by.
"Good people can save and there is no trouble", he says.
According to him, guests who have come to Pärnu are polite.
They have, of course, exaggerated a bit with bottles, but young people are young and the Lord God - let us go, but be people and we can do it!" he says.
The residents of the beach have travelled away by then, either to relatives or acquaintances.
But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life – people like this kind of mood,” says Tiina, who has been walking with children in Pärnu.
His family's sleep music will not disturb either, although last year it was heard even further from this year.
Last summer, the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, that actually sounds quite good there by the Pärnu River,” he says.
Pearson cuts another 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3000 jobs and reduce its interim dividends by 72 percent, thus launching another restructuring programme to address the distress that is threatening the business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the jobs to be lost, which are likely to be concentrated at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be added to the 4000 posts lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs under the third cost reduction programme by an additional £300 million ($394 million) to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid digital learning transition.
The company that agreed to sell a stake in the company last month to its partner Bertelsmann said that their expectations for the year had not changed since the announcement of a 1 % increase in sales to GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killed one NATO soldier and wounded several others.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the Qarabagh district of the city.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday in the Herat mosque attack.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people in Kabul near the Iraqi embassy.
NATO statement said that the explosion on Thursday evening took place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "self-made explosive device carried by man".
According to the statement, everyone is in a stable condition and they are treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), are a serious source of concern for the forces in NATO Bagram in Qarabagh.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which around 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul, mainly in the Shiite region.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a large bomb attack in the city centre killed more than 150 people - this is the most fatal military attack in the country since the US-led forces repelled the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States, Donald Trump, is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's army and the police.
Correspondents claim that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the smog order following the actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of a Obama-time regulation obliging states to limit the emissions causing smog one day after 15 states sued the agency for this course of action.
EPA announced its decision to continue with the "Ozone Measurement Operations 2015" late on Wednesday, stating that it demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
We believe that we need to have a dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," said Scott Pruitt, head of the EPA, in a statement.
In June, the Bride had announced the EPA's intention to postpone the ozone content determinations Ö which measure the smog pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to meet the stricter air quality standard Ö until October 2018.
15 mainly democratic states filed an action with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to reverse a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, is part of a more ambitious plan to boost growth.
But these attempts have provoked reactions among democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
It is stated on the EPA website that inhalation of air containing ozone "may reduce lung function and increase the risk of respiratory disease" such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle can have a party, as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, writes Bloomberg.
This year, it can be done in such a way that, weeks before harvest, the fruit intended for the bread industry can only be used as feed for animals.
The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, Analyst of Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 per cent of German wheat can be used for animal feed, which is double compared to the usual, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heat wave.
In July, Germany was hit by storms, which have continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not even started its development yet, the local harvest collector Ceravis announced.
It's pretty complicated days," said the senior trader of Ceravis, Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, i.e. the clever kinks of Finnish interior design
The beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fair houses, because through large windows the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
Every step of the way, our northern neighbours’ efforts to create both crisp and perfect (energy-efficient) homes are striking.
The Finns’ ability to use wood as construction and finishing material, furniture and beauty products, deserves admiration as well as observance.
Exciting techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fairhouses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It makes it clear that black, white and grey shading combinations, if supplemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked for another week, because the fair will last on 13 August.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
On the night against the present day, a line was drawn to this year’s weekend festival Baltic and Martin Garrix gave everything to remember as the last performer.
At the time of the Garrix performance, the people were really in a twist - singing, singing, dancing for themselves.
When Garrix was finished, the city was spread out as a common mass on the Pärnu beach.
We will bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer caught during the weekend in three days.
Surely you are also in some of them, look for yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to go to the most attractive boxing match of the near future in the 66.7 kg weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN office in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's bad weighing champion.
After the victory of the unanimous decision of Garcia over the former four-time World War Adrien Broner on Saturday Showtime, both fighters belong to the top five of the balance table.
Garcia extended her right hand and said, "How are you doing, champion?
I wish you success."
Lomachenko protects her belt against Miguel Marria at 19 ESPN on Saturday evening.
When the couple posed for the photos, Egis Klimas, manager of Lomachenko, noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a "perfect measurement".
I'm a former feather-weight," Garcia recalled.
I moved up to [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move below light weight.
And he has to move up the light weight [61.2 kg], and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted this.
Let us offer them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to look at it, which is part of his strategy of having Lomachenko debut in 61.2 kg class later this year to make a possible meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell match after their lightweight title round at the Forum on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be paid because fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
We are the main players.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said that she considers Lomachenko "a mighty fighter" and can go see her Saturday match.
However, Lomachenko was modest in praise of Garcia, saying that in his opinion, the master of the three divisions from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this knockout".
Garcia said the goal was to show the impact strength and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt that the tension was growing for prosperity between them.
This is a fight that is waiting to be realised.
No other confrontation creates so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work for it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I have been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight."
What parts of the world are being moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13 000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
For example, when it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 aliens last year, the number last year was 4928.
The authorities do not know how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years this number is approaching 2000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased sharply during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, 675 a year earlier.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most in Estonia – last year, more than 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than left.
The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to the complicated circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and study opportunities are being sought in a country where the community and many people are already in front of the family,” said the press representative of the Ministry of the Interior, Kristin Rammus.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who were granted a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years the most temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter.
If Ukrainians come here mostly for work, then Russian citizens for family migration.
Considering the historical Russian community here, they are also likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia,” said Helina Maasing, Migration Researcher at the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences.
If you look at where the Russian citizens who received the Estonian residence permit have gone to live, then Ida-Viru County is right after Harju County,” he added and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to extend their residence permit decreased.
The leap is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit for permanently settling in Estonia has been applied for,” explained the press representative of the Ministry of the Interior, Rammus, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for settling permanently in Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage people who have adapted to stay here.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased due to the new residence permit.
For example, last year, 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state no longer takes care of whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit was very popular - applicants last year were holders of grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people were granted a residence permit to settle in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When in 2007 three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, last year 200.
They come from Nigeria to study at the universities here.
Estonian universities are also popular among, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased mainly due to study migration.
They also have a rule that where the community has emerged, there will be others more easily,” added Rammus.
For ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If around 6000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, this is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union are included, migration will remain around a percentage,” said Maasing, commenting that the numbers are actually small.
According to statistics, 14 822 people travelled to Estonia last year, and 13 792 people left here.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year.
Most of the movers and movers are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the leavers.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens last year was in deficit with 2000 people.
Estonians mostly travel between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion charms with satic, embroidery and tulle
The bottomless box of ideas is, however, history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream somewhere in the museum for hours and admire old sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, you will study and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem unfamiliar to some, but the designer does not think so.
You decide for yourself how much shine you have in your life!
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I created.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on a red carpet every day, he wants to wear the most beautiful dresses, too, and he wears it!
You can live your life on your own!
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and grey everyday life.
It was this reasoning that led to the plan to take high fashion to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people who often cannot be reached by fashion.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion alley, where a royal dephile with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, the posture is often taken in, nodded in dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - shout bravo, stand up, want to thank you by your hand.
A large part of the audience just came to visit, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they will be fascinated!
And I like the feeling that I am on a summer tour with my fashion design.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre-long red carpet, full of beautiful dresses on the street, it seemed that they would never end!
Maria also does not admit that the creation must be presented to the supermodel, she will gladly bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they are always happy to come.
This is such a great experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my own performance, I am always behind the stage to give the last touch to things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve would not allow you to watch the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who does not just want to play a representative role, but to be in everything by the hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection is done by myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, discover.
I am never far from my creation, and I am not afraid of work.
It is not limited to design, it is also a matter of style, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything must fit into the day of one temperate woman.
Those hours are still huge for fanatics.
I can't tell when my workday ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I am still very lucky - it is like a lasting chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
It has been said several times that my dresses have magic - they make me feel like a princess.
The plentiful tulle satis rows that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained Mammu Couture's signature to this day.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian group tournament was now turned against us
I'm sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing I noticed was that we didn't get our table.
And if there is such a big difference at the table, there is nothing to do," commented Martin Müürsepp, the only basketball player who played in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach, who played in the UK.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and, as a result, received so many more attacks.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defence or attack, it created .
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up protection.
In the defense, however, they managed to hold hands everywhere, we could not combine.
It knocked the team's feet down.
The opponents' homework was better done.
In the opinion of the mason, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to slow down the attack on its opponents in the bud.
In the last quarter - we had a zero error, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
The athleticism and intense insistence, which was our weapon in the group tournament, now turned all against us.
Today, we had no power against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament in general, you can say good things about the whole team, until today there was a common punch.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent had not been met before.
The cup has always been self-confident and played out today, but it seemed that she was tired - she has been carrying quite a heavy burden.
But he made some pretty moves that I've seen in training before," the supervisor added.
Terrible numbers: the girls' basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters in an EM tournament...
The U18 age group is not only a basketball tournament for youngsters from the EM Division B in Tallinn, the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And unfortunately, the Estonian game with Poland tended to be in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but still after the third quarter, the situation was 9:49, or it was only in the last ten minutes that the opponents took their feet from the gas pedal, and that period remained in a tie 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4 points, while in the third quarter, Estonia scored 1 points...
At first, Estonians hit two of the first four in two minutes, then 25 by the game, then one by three, and then 21 by the other...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, one of the 47 shots was captured.
In addition, 2 points out of four free throws.
The number of ball losses during this time was reasonable, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland’s throwing capacity was 33 percent and Estonia was 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, and on the opening day it was necessary to recognise the 83:56 best of Portugal.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent mine control group arrived in Tallinn for a scheduled port visit to complete the ship’s supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
In the course of the visit, the ships prepare for the return to the sea and at the same time provide crew members with the opportunity for a couple of days’ rest.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historical explosives.
The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation training in local waters carried out by them illustrates well our integration with the allied forces,” said the Commander of the Operations and Planning Department of the Navy Navy, Captain Major Arto Reinmaa.
As of 29 June, the NATO 1st permanent mine control group will be led by Latvian naval commander Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of the group commander from the Estonian naval officer Lieutenant Johan-Elias from Seljamaa.
The flagship of the group is LVNS Virsaitis, a support vessel of the Latvian Navy, which also has the command staff of the group.
This half-year, the Estonian Navy minehunter Sakala is part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of vessels under the NATO Marine Command, NATO's 1st permanent mine control group is a readiness unit belonging to the primary rapid response team, which the alliance can deploy to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, initiated by Maestro Eri Klas 13 years ago, will be held.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joosti (36), the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic Society.
Risto Joost: The listeners will receive the classics of the opera world, Traviata and Tosca, ballet performances from the captivating Bolero to the fun Karlsson, and there will also be no plan for own production, which this time will be the production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio Seasons by the same international creative team, who brought Haydn's second masterpiece "Creation" on stage in Pirita in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It is larger than any music theatre in its usual form.
This is a festival that will be captivated and never let go.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human perceptions in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Did not the shoes of Maestro Eri Klas look a bit big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my conducting career.
Perhaps it is because of this that it will be easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it will also be passed on to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
The great heart of Eri Klas also gave me strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic Society.
And here I am now and I can handle it!
What could excite the audience at this year's festival, what special do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballet written in the story of Astrid Lindgren will be presented.
This is "Karlsson flying".
And one of the notorious nuances is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
He probably has a character in his soul since he was a child.
Risto, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner for sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have it with a pile.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as on me, or how I meet every new day.
And this conscious maintenance of tone, maintenance of positivity, and actually smile on myself in the mornings in the mirror, significantly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially this week, when the most important samples are, I have practiced it especially eagerly and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and increases the tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people still don't know half of the things that the universe offers them, but everyone will discover it slowly.
Now, it's an important moment.
Do you have any ritual before you step into the conductor's remote?
It is, however, necessary to change clothes for the more comfortable ones.
This is the little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or take a little nap before a big show.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before entering the conductor's console.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here’s what you can discover, even to a friend of a not-so-large opera and ballet!
Watch a cool video with Risto Joost!
New results of age evaluation tests for Swedish asylum seekers published
In Sweden, a test was conducted among asylum seekers to assess their age medically with a novel approach.The latest results show that more than 80 percent of the test subjects were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started tests earlier this year.
The tests were created in the context of a more accurate assessment of age in applying for asylum, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly minor refugees.
To date, migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing and the Institute of Judicial Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were judged to be 18 years of age or older, and in 25 other cases, the Institute of Judicial Medicine assessed that the test could be "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was "possibly under 18."
Tests are only used if the age of the person is questioned.
Johan Göransson, working at the Institute of Judicial Medicine, said that the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
We do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued the results of the 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older".
But when the newspaper Sven Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed to be receiving 18.
This medical age assessment method, which involves taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints, then allowing dentists and radiologists to analyze them, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose tasks include the assessment of human biological maturity to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later than usual.
I have had reason to think about it and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we should not make a face that we can," he said to the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute of Judicial Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of a child being incorrectly divided into adults is small.
The highest risk, i.e. at about 10%, is if the person is just under 18."

The 20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London World Championships, gaining a good 18th place with 67.37.
The organ was the youngest female hammer thrower in the World Cup, and a happy woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80), I immediately made my average score, in the second (62.80) I risked too much, and in the third (67.37) I managed to keep my head clear,” said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions and I am very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel’s World Cup debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rain did not disturb the Organ because he is training through the winter at the Tallinn University of Technology stadium.
I'm hardened," he said with a little squeal.
At the London Olympic Stadium, there was almost a full house of people, did Orel perceive people around him or was it able to turn himself off?
I felt, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says that it gives more - that's what it is!
If you compete, you can experience it.
The organ confirmed that it was satisfied with the World Cup debut and that it was still waiting for a lot of good competitions: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old, and the only thing that matters is the M.M.
I bring a good experience and on some days I want to compete for medals.
The governor of West Virginia announced a party exchange
West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at a meeting with President Trump that he would change parties.
Like it or not, but the democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
Today I say to you, after a lot of prayer and thought... today I say to you, Western virgins, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
The gathering sparked joy.
So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia assembly.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia, and Justice did not support Hillary Clinton, a candidate for democratization.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
Its value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "the exchange of governor Justice's party is another blow to the democratic party, which would prevent the country from being improved again rather than working towards it".
Only 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history - the announcement by Governor Justice is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is run from end to end and unable to find a positive and unifying message," said Ronna McDaniel, Chairwoman of RNC, in a statement to CBS News.
It is no surprise that where there are many people, there are also many injured.
Urmet, who was in charge of the medical tent at the weekend, said yesterday to Õhtuleht that they had had to distribute quite a lot of patches.
Blisters and abrasions are basic, twists and slight falls.
Of course, also head, back and leg pains.
According to Urmet, the guests will come to the festival with the wrong shoes and so the problems will come.
Medics have also had to help a couple of visitors with the greatest injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
Smaller seams will be done here, bigger ones will be sent to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if festive medics are asking for painkillers for the treatment of hangovers.
Coe praised the Russians for their honest apologies for the doping scandal
International track and field leader Sebastian Coe praised "Russia's Thursday's honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back to sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the Russian track and field leader, said at the IAAF Congress, which took place on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that the ban on competition imposed on his country is correct and he has a firm goal of fighting doping.
He apologised for "all track and field athletes from whom gold and silver medals have been plucked in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on competition imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to journalists.
The whole Council and the whole Congress were satisfied that the Russian Federation itself admitted that they had had quite a difficult time and that they would do everything possible to restructure the Alliance."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but the Congress supports the working group's proposal that this is not the right time to take back Russia," Coe said.
We must do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always proceeded from the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian track and field athletes who meet the stringent IAAF criteria will compete as neutral athletes in the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF team, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet several recovery criteria.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping control is still inadequate and that the banned coaches are still operating freely.
The revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference in the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the revolution in electric cars significantly change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose from another, smaller mining companies are not helped.
Glencore currently earns from coal and oil, but in the era of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will continue to grow.
This year, the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway have increased their contributions to the proliferation of electric cars, allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
As a result, Volvo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that over two decades, electric cars will be sold more than fuels produced from oil.
Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambranini told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has grown for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore said.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in the demand for electric car batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore derives from the growing electric car trend from the increase in copper prices and the fact that it is the world's largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this brokerage company, the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to the changing trend.
This year, the price of cobalt on the London Metal Exchange has increased by 70 per cent.
Last year's price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also increased by 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share in London rose by 20 percent, having surpassed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side, lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of lead is batteries that supply starters for petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, Head of Metal Market Analysis at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effect of the roll-out trend has not yet been noticed in the form of lead price movement.
Lead has risen by 17 per cent this year, and it is the best price metal among the main industrial metals in London.
Investors will only see problems with metal in the distant future.
I'm not sure it's so bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps regular cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager of the metal broker company Triland Metals.
When lead demand falls, it happens slowly.
It may happen in about ten years.
However, in the meantime, stricter exhaust emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which are dependent on advanced lead-based batteries in the frequent engine development, will grow, will be assessed by an international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further away with less electricity.
This explains an additional 1.6 million tons of aluminium demand until 2013-2016.
It accounts for 2.7 per cent of the world's total aluminium production.
This trend is likely to worsen, said Widmer.
Aluminium has increased by 13 per cent this year, as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers do not sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of lightweight car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop lighter alloy steel to resist aluminium.
Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet said, "Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet should be the answer to this development."
Some progress can be seen in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to the planet.
Last year it took about half of this precious metal to catalyse diesel cars, said metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
Many raw materials currently in high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, a raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change in 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore leader Marc Grynberg said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold than full electric cars.
The great hope of the platinum producers over a 10-year horizon is that of the hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motors, which depend on the platinum to produce electricity from the hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet justified itself commercially.
Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP of Paribas Brunet.
German car manufacturers were hit hard in July because the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that holds the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
UEFA's Financial Regulations for Fair play (FFP) introduced in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid €222 million ($262 million) solely to buy a Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will amount to €10 million a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar going to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to raise such money to recruit Neymar and add it to its star-rich lineup, given that the team is funded by the family of a Qatari energy richer.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come up with their own in the football business.
FFP was founded by Michel Platin after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into great debt for success are actually engaged in deception and risk ruin if banks or owners should give up support.
Since 2011, FFP has been focusing on monitoring the losses instead of the debts of the clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential, and then to spend heavily on improving the team and creating a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs may incur losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platin's disgraceful rejection of the presidential office in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
FFP is certainly not dead, and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said Andrea Traverso, the Associated Press last week, who oversees FFP in UEFA.
Although PSG paid for the Neymar buy-over clause as a single full payment, it is possible for PSG to split this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract, which makes it possible to show the transitional fee in the amount of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
In the first wave of the FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with the Manchester City owned by Abu Dhabi, received the most severe punishments on the neck.
PSG was fined €60 million (at that time €82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club was required to limit the team of the Champions League to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to outsmart a regulated financial institution by blowing up their income through the companies associated with the owners of the club.
A Qatari company may sponsor a PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority PSG's support was inflated.
It has been said that some of Neymar's PSG's service may come from Qatar through the payments of the 2022 World Cup Management Board.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador for the World Cup and claim that the UEFA regulators could easily uncover such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not proactively discussed the transfer of Neymar with the PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of PSG.
The most recent reports show that PSG made a profit of more than EUR 10 million in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of around EUR 542,4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a good effect on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30 per cent in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish League, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar's transition by claiming that PSG was violating FFP.
This is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the country," said La Liga President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsene Wenger, the manager of the Arsenal, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's view that the state finances the club.
This is the result of the property, and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as a country may have other ways or other interests for such a large player to represent the country."

Today 50 years ago: a storm of hurricane size in Estonia that torn roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August caused major damage to Lääne County, Harju County and Rapla County in particular.
During those days, the wind speed in north-western Estonia was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree in the garden to another and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and timid, like the end of the world.
The roofs were already flying from the houses in Taama, in 2002, Mrs. Linda Kurova from Haapsalu recalled in an interview with the magazine Eesti Loodus.
Linda's husband saw the garden that she planted collapsed.
But what do you still support the trees with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, water splashed in from the windows,” said Mrs. Linda at the time, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station apron had flown 20-30 meters, Linda saw most of the Haapsalu people just the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in a tasting, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everyone looked very frustrating, the storm ran through beautiful old trees with a raging and crackling like a war.
In August 1967, compared to Western Estonia, the West Virumaa storm did not suffer much, but the losses were also great there, wrote the Virumaa Gazette in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped off the ground, but the parks in our area were also severely damaged.
The wind speed in Tallinn was measured at up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
In the evening of August 6, in Tallinn, a little girl named Merivälja: "Mom, mother!
Chickens are in the air and can no longer sign!", Virumaa Teataja wrote.
At the time of the storm, the building of Põlli Manor in Viljandi County was destroyed so that it was later decided to demolish it.
The August storm was not supported by the constructions of Türi ski jump hill, which were not restored later.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on August 12, 1967 that the clearing of towns and settlements of fallen trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could participate in the cleaning work.
In the storm, grain fields were also badly damaged, and the newspaper stated that "the party's primary organisations must be inspiring and guiding both in the restoration work and in the harvesting of grain".
Hurricanes can be discussed if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of gusts in Estonia will last from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu measured the wind speed at 48 m/s.
The instrument broke on the island of Vaindloo, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
The colder summer weather also means less cleaning on the beaches of Tallinn.
If there is no weather, then people are on the beach, and if there are no people, then there are no people,” says the beach cleaner.
Seagulls are crying on the North Tallinn Stroomi beach.
They are faced with melodic competition from a tractor running at low revs, which ploughs stripes off the track.
In fact, the last seven centimetres of sand sieves through the sand, picking up marine litter and left-off litter: bottle caps, cigarette cones and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, then people are on the beach, and if there are no people, then there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, the head of the cleaning work at Haabersti Beach.
It's 6.30 a.m. and there's a bitter clean-up on the beach, because at 8 a.m. the square has to be good for people.
Usov is already on duty at four o'clock.
Besides Stroomi, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljassaare Pikakari beach.
The amount of garbage has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People are now able to appreciate what is being done for them", says Usov, who has been cleaning the beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new was set up, it was already broken the next day.
Now what's on the beach is already being held.
Clean beach price
One of the biggest works in Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea litter or plough.
For example, on Pirita beach, it has to be transported 400 000 tons over the beach season.
It's an incredible amount," says Usov.
Another big category is household waste, i.e. everything that people leave behind.
The 1.5 km Stroomi beach strip has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
There is so much rubbish.
However, the colder summer weather has meant that there is a fifth less garbage than otherwise.
The third species is abandoned.
Mostly they are children's toys.
As a harvest this time, Usov has shoved out ten model cars from the sand.
They will remain waiting for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
Usually more of them come out, but this is a normal harvest. Usov already knows that he will soon find them in the sand again.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
The rubbish is dispersed
Erika Scholler, the representative of Haaberst’s administrative services, admits that the screening work of the tractor is disrupted by the local.
Noise, which lasts from night hours to early morning, interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighbourhood.
However, this work is impossible during the day.
The beach has to be screened twice a month.
If we don't, the district will fine us," says Scholler.
But the goal is to get Stroomi beach under the quality mark of the international blue flag, just like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu.
Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained,” says Scholler.
We have more plows and stones and it is harder to sift the sand.
However, there is less rubbish in our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
When he hears that the beach is talking about garbage, Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, uncompromisingly enters into a circle of conversations with journalists and cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
In the mornings, there is a filthy picture everywhere.
The problem is with birds and bottle pickers who have pulled garbage bags inside out,” Martin says.
Although it is difficult to expect people to be able to change their current behaviour, Martin hopes that the city council will do something about the garbage bins and, for example, put covers on them in order to prevent the birds at least from walking there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroomi beach.
It can be seen that the city is taking care of this.
With children's squares, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It was once so that roller skates could only ride on one road,” Martin notes.
Findings of treasure hunter in Stroomi: coins, only coins
A 40-year-old Dimitri, who combs the edge of the beach with a metal detector as a treasure hunter, has come to take advantage of the morning tidal period.
He does not believe that today or in the future he will find anything valuable.
The sea gods are not generous enough for this.
I've been dealing with this for a year and haven't found anything valuable so far," Dmitri says.
As a hobby treasure hunter, Dmitri has some euro coins, bottle caps and dangerous nails in his treasure bag, which later throws into the trash.
Usually there are coins.
There is usually no gold, rings and so on,” notes the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the previous level, as the weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation on the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain subdued, as household savings have put interest rates on hold.
The policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6:2 in favour of keeping the rates at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened the support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also indicated that an increase in the rates would be necessary to contain inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that a higher than expected increase in loan costs might be necessary in the financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package to boost the economy launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a fixed-term funding scheme offering cheap funding to banks in February, although it said that an offer of £15 billion would now be expected under this scheme, i.e. £115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain weak in the near future, as the difficult situation of households' real incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
As regards rates, it was reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" is necessary to alleviate inflation, to the extent that it is "slightly higher" than expected in the markets.
The stock exchange is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have dampened growing hopes for an increase in GDP from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to households suffering from rising inflation and pitiful wage rises to rejoice, saying that the situation will get a little worse before the recovery.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income shocks in the next few years, but a noticeable recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Owing to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British produce, which partly compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the rates were moved last August by 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which led to a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the bank, it is likely that it will take four years for prices and the economy to breathe life in full.
Before the bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for an increase in the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on the distressed households; in July, three policy makers demanded an increase in the rate of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although according to the bank it was as expected and there will be a rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excessive increase compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Head of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to become increasingly competitive again, as lenders crave work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable for those whose current transactions are about to end, as refinancing, often at no-charges and low rates, has become more and more popular."
NHS is writing out 10 000 people for a conflicting HIV drug
Since September, patients have access to "transformative" HIV-prevention therapy after a battle at the Supreme Court over whether NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that public health is now making available an estimated 10 000 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets in the initial three-year clinical trial, which are administered before intercourse and have shown a reduction of approximately 86% in the risk of infection in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to provide a clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's ruling that NHS was able to pay for the PRC, despite its own claims that the medicine should instead be financed by the local authorities.
NHS England CEO Simon Stevens welcomed this move as a "new, far-reaching intervention" on Thursday, while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as a "revolutional moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people, and in October, there will be more clinics before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PRCA significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking the treatment before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the human body that prevent you from getting HIV.
Such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Eligible candidates include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with partners who are infected with HIV and are not receiving treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner does not receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family physician there can also register at the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs £10 million and NHS England signed the contract to get the medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to evaluate the true potential of the treatment by collecting clinical evidence on who the product is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in the large picture.
Stevens said: "This new massive intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is yet another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades against one of the greatest health problems of humanity."
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
If targeted correctly for those who need it and are at risk, the possibility of changing the HIV epidemic in England is offered.
From September, people at high risk of HIV in England will have access to a powerful new tool, funded by this NHS clinical trial, which is individually manageable and independent of negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly launched across the country and that no individual at risk of HIV is excluded.
Now that the medicinal product from the clinical trial for the PML has been procured, we are on our way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of contracting HIV.
Public Health Shadow Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and drag of the government's feet.
The evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to stop HIV prevention and its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the NNRTI.
It is now important that the clinical trial is implemented as soon as possible in the country in order to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity prices in Estonia increased by 12%, while prices in Latvia and Lithuania decreased.
In July, the difference between the exchange price of electricity for the next day between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference is the breakdowns in the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month and the price increased by 12% compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price decreased by five per cent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the Nord Pool system price was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 per cent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved in 75 per cent of the previous month’s hours to Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not have next-day transactions.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved from Estonia to Latvia in 99 per cent of the time and 73 per cent of the hours had total transmission capacity.
According to the transactions that took place on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the exchange price of electricity could be around 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the production price of electricity, rose last month and transactions took place at the price of 5.04-5.47 euros per tonne.
Living high life - half-storey and smart design tips have made this small Earls Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, swapped her large Knightsbridge home for Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
Before that, I lived with my ex-partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
From the first visit, this 93 square meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a semi-storey to take advantage of the high ceilings.
I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Duck & Shed from the architectural and design studio at Erfan Azadi Notting Hill to take advantage of 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-storey where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
We had to reorganize the rooms so that they would be located on top of each other without having to bow down.
This was not just about building a platform, but using a steel structure to ensure that the height of both the upper and lower spaces was correct."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms with lots of dramatic elements on top of each other in the room.
From the semi-storey, you can see a glamorous dwelling below the retrovius window with an old copper light.
The mirrored golden furniture, silver details and retro Serge Mouille highlight the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
Mirrors have been added at both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored back door makes a window open to the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet provides a storage space for all Joanne cutlery and glassware.
The living room has the opportunity to close the kitchen if it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
In this kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that it is a garage type retractable door.
It was a bit of a design effort," explains Erfan, a steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
It has a counterweight, which is why it slides very easily when it is pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
After all, the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," says Erfan.
A real estate agent enters an outdated room and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor area, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The materials are what you touch and thus help to create an emotional connection with your home," says Erfan.
You will not fall in love with the electrical cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart's tongues ring."
This shows that good design and increased area help to make an ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even create a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter based in the Chicago skyscraper, competing with his colleague for a promotion.
No amount shall count other than the amount of money earned, alongside which any ethics shall be forgotten.
A man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that this is the version of the business world of the card house - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech pattern is similar.
The further the film, the less the frame-housed element remains, and the moralising intention of the filmmakers is becoming more and more apparent.
As a life-changing experience, the protagonist becomes ill with cancer.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
A son dreaming of an architectural profession makes his father think about really important things like faith, goodness, love, even the disaster of twin towers, during his walk to the large Chicago buildings.
After the third scene in which the son opens his eyes, it is felt that filmmakers have proceeded from the goal of definitely getting the audience to cry, because even the most heartily-hearted viewer is unable to hold back tears when seeing the suffering of a lovely cancerous boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation almost seems hopeless, his father will finally understand the morality of his work and do a good deed to an old man seeking a job.
Now I bet on myself - if the film is happy, then I reward my perceptiveness after the film with coffee, but if I am wrong, then the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment there is a suspicion that you will lose your coffee - when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes to the hallway in slow motion.
However, the son is wonderfully healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it also turns out to be positive, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of American drama quite well!
In honour of the truth, the film is well designed, all the necessary elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morale is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this film will bring in well.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in the water.
Here's an excerpt from the reporter, Josh Dawsey:
When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with high-ranking officials on his first working day, he pointed out a key issue in the White House of President Donald Trump, which he was planning to solve ▏ the arrival of bad information in the President's hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to pass through him, either on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if good information were given to him."
Kelly's diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have also tried it and they have failed to tame Trump with his media consumption monitoring.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he is in the White House, his TV viewing habits have not disappeared.
If candidate Trump was mad at the unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also fairly reflected in the affected publications," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "six former campaign workers say the key to managing Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption is stable and includes a praise song".
All right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter usage habits have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us do not know Ö that Trump’s tweets would have been even more flammable without their intervention.
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump did not post.
If his assistants managed to save him even a few times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from consistently provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competitive clicks, people are trying exclusively to promote their own interests by transmitting material to Trump that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, reflecting the whole story, wrote in May about the advisors' tendency to feed the President with strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is:
The current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump can react explosively to negative press, especially to the damaging information leaks, by obsessively identifying their source.
This is what happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, an internet provocator belonging to Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh, of being the "source of several leaks of information" in the White House.
It does not matter that Johnson is permanently blocked from Twitter because of his mockery, or that he did not provide any concrete evidence, or that he has also in the past made false accusations and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began to ask about Walsh under his subordinates."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the Head of the White House Office, Rob Porter, "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trump".
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will be more effective in leading Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from abroad to the capital do not get permission to perform bitterly.
There are many foreigners in the centre of Tallinn who can make music.
Those with whom Õhtuleht talked about admitted that they were playing in the Old Town without permission from the city centre.
First we found three street musicians near the Viru gates, who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that the musicians with dreadlocks and split clothes were rucksack travellers who could use a shower to berry.
Despite its appearance, the only woman in the company played a fun rhythm on the accordion, while one man juggled with three balls next to her and invited the passers-by closer.
The third man had sat next to them on one of the rucksacks and smoked a self-made flip-flops in peace of heart.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Noem, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled with the balls, said that he played in the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the event was to collect ticket money for a ship to Finland on the same day.
On the question of whether they asked the city for permission to perform in the Old Town, Noem and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we did not know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and most often permits are granted for a month or something like that.
There is no point in paying for this," Bob explained.
When we came back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians and drove them away.
The company moved with the luggage bags and dogs to the Viru Centre crossroads to try their luck.
Three young people from Poland also appeared on Viru Street, one of them played the violin, the other the clarinet, and the third had even taken the electronic piano with him.
We are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living,” explained trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivosh, they are aware of the need to have the permission of the government to perform.
"Of course we don't have it", he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we will go elsewhere, but we must try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased EUR 149 million of bonds under the public sector purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area in July, while the central bank’s bond portfolio grew to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information about purchases.
In reply to the interpellation of the members of the Riigikogu, Governor of Eesti Pank Hardo Hansson has previously explained that the asset purchase programme of the Eurosystem central banks includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds (covered bonds), covered bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases have the effect of reducing the return on lower risk assets, which motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a rule, under the public sector bond purchase programme, each central bank buys government bonds from its own country; bonds from other countries are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Substitution purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds under the purchase programme is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank has been buying bonds under the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, the bonds of Elering were also acquired, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy the bonds of Elering from June 2016.
As of June, both Elering and Eesti Energia will purchase bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Migrants ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaires' district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again come into furious confrontation with determined travellers who have ignored the trench dug by the council to win back the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field to a wealthy "millionaire district" near the baptized Solihull street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks after they were only kicked out of there in May, without being distracted from the trench that was dug up by their intrusion council.
The tactical group found a weak spot within the guard by squeezing their vehicles through an unobstructed part left as a footpath.
People who are furious have been harassed by Solihull Council, saying that the Council is "no use in dealing with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after they were driven out of Bentley Heath, where they stoned the passers-by.
The council must be shamed for them to take action, because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back again.
They came in last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long seals to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying the council tax if the council can't even stop such a thing."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last of these travellers leave, and there is already a new attack.
This time, the number has increased, and grassland has even been seen to remember the horse."
A representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable camp site on the ground near Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with Solihull Police, and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence when as many local people as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The weekend festival will also be visited by Indrek Saar, Minister of Culture, among others, who is pleased that the world’s top names have been brought to Estonia.
The question why the weekend festival is so important for Estonians is answered by Saar that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the festival’s three-day talk to the fullest.
However, he admits that real practitioners have come to Pärnu.
Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, they bring home the absolute top names of this music genre - this is often not happening around us,” says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists at the festival, however, speak most about themselves at Saart?
I consider myself a relatively old person, and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
According to his turn of the record, all of us have turned their feet at some point,” he says.
However, he also mentions a number of other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, also our own Estonian producers: starting with NOËP and they can be read in a whole series.
In fact, this concentration of well-known names is very high", he says.

Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of BMW, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the home city of BMW Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
No company described these actions as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been keenly promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered to be a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment installed to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles for automotive companies will increase, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of hoarding powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies try to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, who silently used the so-called deceptive devices, which allowed the reading of the exhaust gases to be adjusted to the regulations while the car was being tested, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was implicated in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany, when the authorities accused the installation of the Audi system of circumventing European emission requirements, thus extending the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of the audit in the investigation can be a big blow for Volkswagen ▏ the producer generates a disproportionately large part of Volkswagen’s profits.
Estonian schools receive European Union flags for 20 000 euros.
The Ministry of Education intends to purchase the flags of the European Union for the Estonian schools by 1 September.
A total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union flag will receive 570 educational institutions.
The flags are intended to be displayed indoors, they must also be executed in high-quality printing technology indoors with a tunnel fastening, is mediated by the ERR news portal.
The flagpole label contains the following text: "Gift for Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Council of the European Union.
According to the Ministry of Education, the estimated cost of 570 flags is 20 000 euros, i.e. one flag costs 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the latest chaos in Sinaloa state, which is sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and enduring drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change your routine.
Two senior journalists will discuss which seems safer: whether to bring the children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide names for each column ▖ the evidence is not needed, it is enough to feel the impression and the gut feeling.
The government or cartels are suspected of being employed by drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists ▌a whole list of bad people who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no break in violence, and the more bodies are accumulated across the country, the majority of which are journalists �� The Committee of Journalists reports that, since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in in in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been under state protection since the attacks and threats, and seven or more journalists in seven states have been killed so far this year.
Recent deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be sensed everywhere ■ The façade of the Riodoce building hangs a large picture of Valdez showing the middle finger with the inscription "Justice" and two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiley face with glasses or his characteristic hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss a common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As in the case of most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, the number of which reaches thousands, journalists rarely reach trial.
At Riodoce, violence in Sinaloa continues to be reflected, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the information and fairness of the killers, Ibarra said that the security meeting is of little use.
It's very stupid to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
As long as the cause is not known, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the capital of the state, on the morning of May 15.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates into the "twelveth river".
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and crashed in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left her wife and two adult children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, only silence prevails mainly over Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and its release to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, with rival clicks fighting for filling the power vacuum.
It does not matter that a person or even several people are shot every day on Sinaloa streets, or that the graveyard is full of luxurious double mausoleums of drug kings, which are larger than many living homes.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to the fact that only one cartel runs a maritime state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers involved in his work, the co-founder and manager of Riodoce, Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels enormous guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a cartel-clip noseman who competed with Guzman's sons and was at war.
This piece of writing may have angered the sons ▖ the suspect gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived at the newspaper kiosks.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after a raid on another newspaper editorial that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 in shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "it was impossible to deal with the press without touching on the drug problem".
Over time, the newspaper gained recognition with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish robust research without fear of censorship and readers in a fascinating print, from which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) Prize for Freedom of the Press for his courage to follow the Mexican drug scene wherever it leads.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
I want to live on," he said when accepting the AKK award.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
You have to accept the task that comes with the journalist’s office  the second option is to play fools.
I don't want to be asked what I did when faced with so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who roped like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went across the road from the office to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine's love became fatal to him.
His death has also made them doubt themselves how best to do their job and stay alive.
They don't like to mess with these women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used for drug trafficking."
These things should not be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-maintenance even at the best times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to the editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's how it happened to Javier".
He and others say that Sinaloa no longer applies the old rules, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states that are home to the toxic mix of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly mobile phones were no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only spyware sold on site had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for relief from 40 degrees heat in the shade of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, which is located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly wondered whether these policemen were among the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor himself has labeled unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous areas where de facto drug gangs are in control.
Riodoce this week's edition covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story of spending government money on the Governor's home town.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew  the restaurant is a favourite place for both drug traders and the authorities.
The reporter learned from the public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the Revolutionary Party (IRP) in power, which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in large-scale cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who bears the nickname El Chapo, escaped the military raid.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column for information on kidnapping from the best sources.
Previously, we would have known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose clairvoyant bodywork has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
Now all communication channels have been disrupted with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and editorial staff has become something they could never expect ▌activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of tags and went to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez.
A burnt body has been found and, according to officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal all over the country and scribble the phrase "SOS press" on the sidewalks and buildings as an organised protest.
On that day, Bojorquez, the President, is away in Washington, trying to gather international support to bring justice to the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death when he met with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from the government's activities, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "limited" by organised crime, complicit state officials and indifferent society.
In his latest book "Drug journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who are organised in the twinning of crime.
The Media Surveillance Group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and public officials last year.
In Mexico, you die because you want to be silenced," said Ramirez.
The murders obviously have a bloodshed effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamaulipas, the northern state of the border six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, probably signed by the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to his cut off head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern state of the border in Chihuahua after their correspondent Miroslava Brech was killed in March.
Others continue to pass on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez newspaper openly addressed drug cartels with the headline "What do you want from us?" on the front page.
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even the country.
This is a nervous decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and they still have to look at the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are being hunted, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexico apartment in 2015 three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay in place and continue to work need to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that she is frightened by the coverage of the drug business.
Mexico is on its way to hell, which is why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked up, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and sipped beer when suddenly everyone started vibrating their phones.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had died according to confirmed reports of firefights between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by many of the cartels found in the region.
From there on the side of the sidewalk, reporters put the news up on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The front cover of the next day needed to be changed.
The sirens roamed along  another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers on duty to see if they were alert.
If they were afraid, at least they did not show it.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, with his middle finger visible to all Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees carried it in his footsteps.
How could you even think about closing," Bojorquez said, "When the day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaur used protective paint to prevent enemies
At first glance, it seems like a shape, although quite frightening.
Scientists have now published the first findings regarding the discovery of an incredible rhino size entity by the Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with his armour was in reddish brown color and his past had been somewhat "complicated".
The report published in Current Biology described the entity as "the best preserved armoured dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
Fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous Age, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation struck the researchers who describe it as "truely significant".
This armoured vegetarian is the best preserved type of fossil ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He struck something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to study more closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Palaceontology Museum.
The next six years were worked out to dig the animal out of a 2500 pound (1100 kilos) plot.
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to be brought to the public.
"If you squint your eyes a little, you can almost believe that he is sleeping," said Caleb Brown, the leading author, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the being is exhibited.
It goes into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - Mona Lisana."
Researching his skin, researchers found that this herbivore, covered with armour and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be significantly endangered by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This multi-armed dinosaur used a red and white protective colour to hide from predators and applied a shading technique called a counterclip, which is also used by many modern animals.
According to the experts, this allowed the dinosaurs to get closer to the surroundings and avoid enemies, as the larger dinosaurs probably hunted him.
This 110-million-year-old nodosaurus being first appeared on the news in May and is now on the Royal Tyrrell Palaceontology Museum.
Researchers have now researched the being and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealopelta Markmitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7000 hours exposing the animal in a arduous way.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered a countershade - a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top half of the animal was darker than the bottom.
Although the eclipse is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals living today with the eclipse.
This suggests that the dinosaur was hunted sufficiently actively by other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to hide instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
However, most modern animals - e.g. deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as harvests, suggesting that nodosaurus had to work hard to survive.
"The forceful hunting of huge and large scaled dinosaurs shows how dangerous they could have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the scales also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Researchers will continue to study the animal in order to get hints about its life, including its preserved contents, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, thereby reaching the sea with a stream, where it sank in front of its back to the ocean floor.
At that time Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans probably extended much further inland than they are now.
This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - it's enough just to squeak your eyes and it seems like he's sleeping."
The Cretaceous Age was the time when huge carnivorous dinosaurs - the Theorpodes - roamed the Earth on two legs.
Although their all king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armoured dinosaur could be hunted by some of his fearsome predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, the 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six-ton monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and it is a complete cone up to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long spikes broke out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armoured vegetarian adventured through the present West Canada until the flooded river washed up into its open sea.
But the subsea burial site of the dinosaurs helped to preserve its armour in great detail.
The rocky remains of this particular specimen have been preserved so well that the bumpy armour plates along the skulls of the dinosaurs still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "This degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Hardened remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armour plates on the animal's skull.
The right front leg lies next to him and five toes are stretched up.
I can count the armour on his sole."
How did an activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
Brittany Ferrell suffered complete shock on 9 August 2014.
Just a day after travelling to New York, this resident of St. Louis was sitting on a rented bed in a rented room by browsing the phone on Facebook.
He ended up in the post of his former schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information in his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The @TheePharoah user's posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis region sent a real-time tweet of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man killed by a white police officer in Missouri, Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, remaining there for four hours.
It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later on in the evening he saw a tweet that announced the gathering of people on Canfield Drive this time.
They shared photos of the police tape and the yelling people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the label "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!".
He watched a real-time stream where the police stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In the second video, another policeman, he said, "I'm going to shoot all of you... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
This is not the kind of murder that we are used to and that we could call typical."
I felt the horrors at that moment.
I was angry and cried."
He booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, he went to his father's place to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that the next morning they would travel to Ferguson by themselves.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years will be the central theme in the new documentary Whose Streets?, which will be premiered in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who fulfilled the answers by demanding the streets.
When Ferrell and her daughter - wearing a floral dress and a crown on their head - drove to Ferguson, they again talked about what they had repeatedly talked about before this morning - the experiences and living conditions of the brides.
Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" she reminds me of asking herself.
We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
I couldn't take him with me," said Ferrell later.
What is happening now is the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and socialism, and at the same time know the different layers of experience and living conditions, and what we need to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise him so that he does not personally experience blatant racism, he will not be different from any other girl in the family.
I feel that I would do him a disservice if I would protect him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on the way to South Florissant, a place across the road from the police station, which had become a kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news about the police officer, Mr Wilson, who was never finally charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with the local business owner, who prepared lunches.
They put together food bags and helped to share them with protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was the president of the Union of Minority Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in the Christian communities.
I had no experience of organization.
It all just worked out."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with the co-director of a film, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
The question came to Ferrelli's mind: "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come to the community and try to benefit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already laid hands with the co-director, Damon Davis, an artist in the region, known for his activism in relation to the prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement made the project attractive to Ferrell and the other six locals who were followed for years by the team of Whose Streets after shooting Brown.
In this documentary, nobody speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
It was important to me how these people are depicted, because this is how I am depicted."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement did not consist of a "redeemer's guide, but a community gathering", as Folayan said - he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the finished film.
But I realized that doing this job and humanizing the brave people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story emphasizes and re-emphasizes the role of a homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who invented the theme reference #BlackLivesMatter in social media after killing the teenage Trayvon Martin in 2012, are homosexual.
The leading homosexual women have generally maintained movement," said Ferrell, "and this is precisely because we must constantly fight on several fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really kept alive by women who are gay, and many of them are gay women who are gay".
At the same time, he argues that "it is not a matter of some type of equal opportunities" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity.
He was a man of whom the right energy was blown," he said.
But it is not a coincidence that he was right on the front line, because living as a romantic homosexual woman at such hubs is at stake.
His energy can be sensed through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson, but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional penalty imposed on Ferrell for blocking the road at the time of the demonstration lasts for another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region he calls home, just a "dangerous threat".
However, he still considers the mantra to be important, which he has etched into memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
7 tips on how to get over a hangover after a weekend party
Some of the toughest sons of men find, after a plentiful party, that what trouble, that also helps.
Or come from the saying "avoid the hangover, stay drunk".
But it's only an inevitable delay and a good deal of health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painlessly as possible after today's and tomorrow's weekend stroll or other party?
Drink water.
Drinking alcohol down and after, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, even in place of alcohol.
As the body loses a lot of liquid when drinking alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
Minerals are also washed out of the body with water, so it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after a drink, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly aerated.
Go for a walk.
Definitely it would not be worth going to the grandmother with a hangover to break the trees - this could be a fatal false decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remember again what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and sleeping out a hangover is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give the body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you are already getting sick from drinking yesterday, it is definitely not worth trying to load a large fat fry into your stomach.
Start with, for example, fresh juice that contains fruit sugar that gently boosts your body.
If health is already suffering around lunch, you might want to try out a broth, for example.
And a little later already a spinal cord.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the last water.
As you have already said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take painkillers to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will not only have to deal with alcohol, but will also have to deal with painkillers or ibuprofen, and this is how it will lose its effectiveness.
This is how you break your liver even more, and in the future, the hangovers will be worse.
In addition, painkiller does not last long in the body anyway.
If you take the painkiller in the morning, do not do it all on an empty stomach - it will irritate your already broken stomach.
Or, if you don't have a partner, get along well with yourself.
It works in the same way as walking, but you can't get an orgasm while walking.
However, avoid too active pace and crazy postures - during a hangover, physical exertion should be moderate.
Make fun.
Talk stupidly with friends and sufferers, make simple fools and laugh amicably over yourself and others (suffering).
Joke and laughter may not make the hangover go away, but with their help, it is definitely more fun to tolerate the aftereffects.
Once upon a time, the hangover will go over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are being sought as suspects in murder
According to the police, a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are being searched nationally, who have become suspects after having found a deadly stabbed male body in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to Cook County court records, arrest orders were issued on Monday without bail for the arrest of 42-year-old Winston Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to a warning issued by Chicago police forces to the community, the body was discovered on 27 July.
Police officers received a phone call and found a victim with multiple stab wounds when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the incident, and investigators consider stabping as murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for Public Relations at the University, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now temporarily suspended and is banned from entering the campuses of Northwestern University.
This is now an investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior assistant in the Finance Department of Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to help the U.S. research institutions in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and would like him to give himself up.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the communications department as Chicago police officer, strongly recommends that suspects turn themselves in to the authorities.
The police have an idea where they are, but we are working to determine the exact location more and more intensively," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in apartment No 1008.
According to the police, it was a gruesome sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras would confirm Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The management of the Grand Plaza sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on the chronology of events and the background to the victim, and are studying various motives, including the possibility that this was a family dispute."
Start-ups to help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce start-up, but the surveys were unprofitable.
Answers were often vague, useless or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to guarantee anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company selling hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for help from outsiders.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and a hot line of complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to bypass C-level managers and contact the board directly.
Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Errett, during the three years he has been using Glint, he has got a much better overview of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys for specific teams, it provides a heat map of the company, which gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the reasons.
Companies are beginning to understand that they need to stay up to date with their work culture, so as not to become the next Uber, which has been wrapped in scandals since a former employee published blog posts that described an harassing environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, having an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance may be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020 according to financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
The conference, a business start-up operating in Colorado, Denver, which helps businesses prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, this year observed an increase in interest and activity against the background of the suspicious reputation of Uber.
Conference has almost 600 customers, including airBaltic, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Conference allows companies to send tailored impulse surveys, collect real-time confidential responses and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the Board.
Public opinion has been spawned by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Conference.
Quinlan said that if it were found that the company was treating its employees badly or acting unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and cases, even if the regulatory authorities did not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Conference for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the headquarters of the office.
If the employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find a telephone number or a telephone number at the headquarters of the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often an intimidating and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday General Counsel James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to track employee complaints.
However, now that the company is using Conference, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices that previously did not reach managers who were active in offices in other cities or states can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
I have access to a holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to violations of ethics in connection with the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media matured" companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being washed openly online.
Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Conference offer their software as a service, charging companies a periodic fee for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supporting both start-ups.
In February, conferences were financed by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thus raising the value of the accumulated capital to $47 million.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing its total funding to $60 million.
Such investments come as no surprise, given the interconnectedness between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are acknowledged and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
If people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the General Benefit and Employee Experience Department at LinkedIn, which uses both Conference and Glint.
Investors earn income when their portfolio companies are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
While third-party analytics tools allow for increased commitment and engagement of employees, it is no wonder that they find support.
Having data on the involvement of employees is important, according to the experts of work culture.
However, this data is useless if the company's supervisors do not do anything about it.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes await.
And if changes are not happening quickly enough or not at all, this can cause frustration and reduce employee involvement.
If you ask for 4000 proposals, you need to be prepared for 4000 interviews," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
Because if things are not completed, the workers think, "Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly surveys among employees, has been able to implement the measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from the disappointing staff on the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with the problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, however, new data are collected on employees and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to a long-term commitment of employees in the industry, which is known for its high turnover of labour.
If you are not committed to transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses."
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltic States: incomes are growing fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic States, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes a reference to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999, the total output per capita of the economy has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Success is due to low debt, rapid improvement of institutions, and a business- and free market-friendly policy.
The Baltic states together with Slovakia are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita has significantly converged with the EU average,” the central bank said.
Although the goal is that the total output of the economy per capita would be equal to the wealthy of Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltic people to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, a little less than half of the respondents thought this was the case for their economies.
NCAA decision to cancel twice daily trainings makes Bruins days long
It's almost 23 o'clock when the UCLA team of football players stops to chat at the edge of a new training field in the team's gym.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, revealing their sweaty backs from the first day of their training camp.
For a large part of the team, these idle minutes offer a midday break.
After three hours of training, the participants of the summer courses will go back to the dormitory for final exams before returning to the Wasserman football centre the next morning at 6.30.
The next three days are a real challenge for them," said Jim Mora, a coach from Bruins, shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel twice daily training sessions to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams are finished on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three training sessions were scheduled to begin at 19.15 to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two trainings a day means more days with one training - the beginning of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season and trainings during the summer courses take place for the first time in the six Westwood seasons of Mora.
They are planning 18 training sessions until 20 August before the official preparations for the opening match against Texas A&M in September begin.
According to Mora, he is in favour of a change in the NCAA's rules, although it adds another item to players' tight schedules.
They have a huge load on three or four days, and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
And they will break through this challenge; they will make an effort; they will be nice young.
I believe that if Saturday arrives and we have more time, it will be really nice."
At the end of the camp, UCLA makes trainings closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of their squares from the nearby parking area and the nearby Luskin centre, a superior class hotel that has already received a handbag with footballs that have escaped the protection network.
From this weekend, Bruins players occupy the hotel, but Mora admitted that there may be problems with free rooms during the season.
We take security measures," Mora said.
This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film training there.
If you have a record of your training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we use a security team there and on the 8th parking lot.
We do our best to make the most of ourselves.
I try not to worry much about it.
We have a plan in place."
In retaliation, the Savisaar-Ivanova election coalition that was born for the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to withdraw from the Estonian Conservative People's Party, our Tallinn and the businessmen's election coalition Tegus Tallinn, which is to be displayed in the hands of the party members - it seems that the election coalitions created on the initiative of the members of the Party participate at least as much in local elections this year as the political parties.
However, chicks are considered in the autumn, and the key question is whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who will stay with Savisaar?
If the number of supporters of Edgar Savisaar has decreased, the events organised in honour of his election coalition can be expected.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current middle party members and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the election coalition?
And is it possible to look for a reason why some of Savisaar’s faithful followers and friends are evading Tallinn from the fact that the “Savisaar list” of the perpetrators, led by the corrupt and suspected of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the city district government for a popular Russian song, in which the elder of the Lasnamäe district participates; and in every sense, a primitive computer game, in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid puddles and squirrels on the bike - is this the first time the Centre Party will catch the votes of the 16- and 17-year-old voters who will be admitted to the ballot boxes?
We look forward to seeing the idea of a young election campaign from other political parties.
If the channel 2 or TV3 viewer faces the black square instead of the entertainment show from the beginning of August, there are two options: to accept that in the future, only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 will be able to see the channels, or to give up the tenth of each month to some TV operators.
There are probably also those who initially publicly enjoy the advertising-free TV experience, but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for the TV picture and the advertisements.
Side-locking music, noisy people and trash left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you do not want to be part of the mood, it is worth discovering your home instead of hurting your head at home – and leaving the place to the festival guests for a hefty amount of money.
Washington changes green card rules
The media quotes President Donald Trump, who said that a new US immigration plan is planned, which will change the rules of the green card.
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-related visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The Bill will be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress.
This law reduces poverty, increases salaries and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers' money, as it changes the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process gives priority to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said in the US media.
The young people of the Siberian Seto move to the city, the retired move back to the countryside.
Jevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners along the river Maana.
He works as a driver in a gold art hotel 140 km from home on the shores of the additional River Kuvai.
It's a tough job: two months in a row without days off 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
Anatoly has only seen gold once in three years of working at the Artel.
There's a tough procedure: when you go in, you'll be thoroughly checked not to bring vodka, and when you go out, not to take gold with you," Anatoli says.
Mare Piho chatting in Haida village with the local Seto Jaaniga, who has told her a lot about the memories of her family in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of the Siberian Setos will also affect the home-setos, because it is just so amazing, thinks Piho Mare, who has studied the distant Setos in more detail.
His first research trip to Siberia this year marks 30 years.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there together for one year.
How many Setos did they still migrate to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I say 8000.
I calculated it according to the stories of the Siberian Seto men, who have also thought about it.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at that time, up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was issued only to a man.
The passport was issued to only one of them, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
See how big this territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomaa.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they came to areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (log rafting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Pechory, many Setos later went to work in the classified town of Krasnoyarsk-45 (the Soviet power built a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, the long tradition of marriage and multi-childhood were preserved.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much did the Seto culture in Siberia differ from the Seto culture in the motherland?
They are different, although what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought along a lot of folk costumes.
They made their own (people's clothes) then, but they always made a distinction between what had been brought along and what had been done here.
Climate change strongly influenced the traditional clothing of the Setos, because it is colder here.
Foods changed.
In Setomaa, for example, meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the villages of Siberian Seto and what life lives there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that this Setumaa is now starting to give back to it, is starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Setho delegation who came to visit Haida at the beginning of July to live in homes for four days - J.P.
What's left here is amazing.
It is very easy to come and go to Tapa, because the city has an excellent location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of roads,” says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have plenty of nature, sports and cultural places, and the pizza is available on every corner.
Kill is a top-top city!
There is a small island along the River Valgejõgi running through the city, where the slaughterers tend to have a Midsummer party.
This beautiful place doesn't seem to be in the train window," Reigo murmuring.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
You can have a picnic on the edge of the river and just make love - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life in advance and behind you.
I have also been there for a walk with my brides.
The opera soloist Tamm has, besides everything else, been to practice her arias between the three bridges on the riverbank: "As this place is on the outskirts of the city, no one may even come back when I humiliate my stories."
There is a wonderful view of Tapa from Männikumägi, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and play disc golf at the moment - golf has been done, discs can be rented from the gym,” Reigo directs.
The old pros go there with their discs, of course, but I haven't played there yet.
We must probably invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to Tapa because he is an experienced disc golfer and has discs.
I think he's lending me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears left on this mountain, disappointments, and you can win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
The whole city centre is currently full of construction works, all this becomes unknown,” Reigo says.
However, the old and tired station building of Tapa is a very attractive place where summer performances are played.
I am glad that in 2012, Märt Meos, the head of R.A.A.M., accepted my idea and came to make a summer theatre with his theatre in the station.
Although this year's theatre season with "Alexei Karenin" was just over, on 11 August, the train station will have a "Wake to Life" as the old station building moves around in the 1980s.
August 11-13 is the Tapa City Days, during which home cafés and numerous cultural events have sprung up in the station building, including a public rally,” says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city in those days.
The museum has been in the small yellow cabin on the 1st May boulevard since 1994.
The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and lots of information,” Reigo praises the place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railroad and military.
Reigo marvels that if you go through all the recommended places in Tapa, your stomach will be empty for a long time, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good dining places, and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you are abroad," he describes.
Well-educated and young soldiers who have arrived in Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but there is such an international community all around.
I think it would be very exciting to listen to the stories from the French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
In the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegal campers in the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing harsh fines on anyone who is skipped from resting in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Checks continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Wolves who teach puppies go to break sheep.
After a year of break, Hiiumaa farmers have to give the wolves "teaching material" from their herd again - probably the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, 23 sheep in total and eight have been injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three, a year earlier 124.
There is also information from the environmental agency that last year no wolf litters were born in Hiiumaa and that the Hiiumaa hunting council has two wolf litters fixed on the island this year.
On the night of Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the municipality of Emmaste and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
In the morning of Wednesday, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of Reheselja village and seriously injured another, who had to be killed in an emergency.
Rules for handling GM crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent to the coordination circle the Bill on Amendments to the Release of Genetically Modified Organisms into the Environment Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the Act will abandon the creation of a separate database for the locations of genetically modified (GM) crops as well as for handlers, for this purpose the plant health register will be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop handler to have a prior agreement within the limits of the person engaged in beekeeping will be modified.
Although genetically modified crops are not grown in Estonia at the moment, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for GM and non-GM crops.
This is at least as long as it has not been decided to declare Estonia GMO-free,” said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
At the same time, it has to be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden of both the private and public sectors,” Suu added.
The draft Act repeals the provisions related to the GM crop location and handlers database and handling training in the GMOVS, establishes the requirements for the handling of GM crop and the establishment of economic activities.
In the specific case of beekeeping, the current obligation for GM crop growers to inform beekeepers about the start of GM crop cultivation is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine the drafts in the information system and, if they wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will primarily affect people working in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
Only one GM crop is allowed in the European Union, including Estonia - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European corn borer to which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this corn line are bred in the southern regions and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to obtain the above assurance, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of various varieties of summer rape, maize and soy in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and as a result of the study it was concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soy varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that genetically modified crops are not deliberately grown in Estonia and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of a "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of a "genius" after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
A player bought over from Chelsea for £40 million started in Dublin in the United States' last pre-season game against the Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 in the original lineup, impressed by the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on raids.
However, being excluded from the Blues pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was badly short of a match form and he only lasted 45 minutes, which Mourinho said must be fixed firmly before the start of the Premier League season.
He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mood," Mourinho said.
We will help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, also started in the first lineup at the Aviva stadium, and Mourinho started to lay down his eleven starting men for the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho would still like to recruit three other football players, but he confirmed that the club had already done an "excellent job" by concluding contracts with three of his four priority selections.
I am grateful to the club that they managed to make three out of four," he added.
I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another crane pup got a GSM transmitter on his foot on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird-watcher living in Sõrve, the first stork-son was accompanied by Sõrve, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nesting area and has joined the large pool of nights in Mullutu-Suurlah.
This is because there are no fields of grain in Sõrve, the Voice of the Islands writes.
This Tuesday, relatively late for ringing cranes, another son of a crane was attached to the transmitter, and this on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project, which is carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork-son named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter in Sõrve, Türju.
His activities are all visible on the Internet: how he went wintering in Spain, coming back to the border between Germany and Poland and then came to Saaremaa,” Martinson said.
The British inventor has installed a microchip in his body to access the house and car with a wrist-tie
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed, so that he could open his front door, access the office, and even start a car with a hand gesture.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam has installed a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and now provides this service through his company BioTeq also to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Hampshire County Royal Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company will also change the locks of houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, asking for 300 pounds per lock.
This married father of one child has now installed the technology both in his home and in his car, the BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The exhibit of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
According to the military records of TIME, the decision of the White House to fly a naval helicopter to the south yard for the American production event last month costed as much as $24 000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One during the President's stay on board, was the central attraction of the event introducing American construction programs that took place in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a fork lift made in Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War Room called for the presence of the helicopter with the partial command, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south yard for a "unusual" event.
I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event," said HMX-1 commander a day before the event in an e-mail to his superior, deputy naval officer in the field of aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive in the south yard at around 7 p.m. on the morning of July 17, and will remain there until the yard is cleaned between 18 p.m. and 21 p.m. on the same evening.
The added fact was that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second flight will be required for the return flight due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squadron security crew remained close to the aircraft for the duration of its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to find out whether or not the second period was eventually needed for the TIME magazine.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this provision.
We asked if this violates Hatch's law, and we were told not to violate it," the commander wrote.
"You seem to have no choice," replied the deputy chief officer.
The White House announced the "American Made" event as an official event and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts of the health reform that had been discussed at the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for commercial purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for photo screening is unusual.
Trump came under the spotlight in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, took place in the background of the president's plane, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
The White House is very pleased with the exhibition "Made in America" featuring products from all 50 states made by American workers of American materials," said Lindsay Walters, acting spokesperson of the White House.
HMX-1 teams often test in the vicinity of Washington and in the south yard to practice putting down the President of the United States to the White House with centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 organised 58 rehearsals in the courtyard of the White House.
According to the official, the flight to the event "made in America" was included in the standard for the training flights of that month.
Squadron helicopters flew on that day for an additional 11 hours for "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, no other exhibit of this event burdened the wallet of the taxpayer.
According to Sikorsky’s representative, the company was not involved in organising the exhibition of the helicopter in the southern yard.
HMX-1 does not retain the President's budget documents and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
However, according to the annual prices of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is 24 380 dollars per flight hour.
The length of the flight was recorded in the Squadron documents from its main base at Quantico Naval Airport in Virginia in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below its amount.
The calculation of taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates is very misleading," Walters said.
These estimated reimbursement rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs, which are taken into account for the annual appropriations.
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but they cover the costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former spokesperson of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopters at the time at the event.
The point is to show things made in America this week," said Spicer.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it."
It is not clear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter during a tour in the south yard, but he did sit behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky's representatives, making fun of the company's products in his personal fleet.
I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - peace and joy arrived through tears
The 2011 World Cup Daegus hit Šadeiko in the last area, a leg cramp in 800 metres, and a stretcher was taken from the stadium.
Immediately before that, he had received zero in the distance jump on a universiade held in China.
In 2012, Helsinki EM was injured in a low-cost event, but won 23rd place at the London debut Olympics with 6013 points.
However, the misfortune continued.
After the opening day of the 2013 Moscow World Cup, the Estonian record-breaking woman suffered a foot injury.
Two years later, he won the 15th place at the Beijing World Championships and met the Olympic standard, but it had also wanted more to disappoint the athlete.
The hardest gauntlet only passed Šadeiko last year, when he did not get a result in the distance jump of the Amsterdam EM.
I would just like to put together a proper multi-juice once.
Once", Šadeiko confessed.
The worst was still to come: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted already due to a thigh injury on the first barrier.
Time had to be taken off - would you like to continue with the seven contests at all?
Is two days of effort still worth all this?
The girl thought for a long time, but found peace in herself.
I got my head clean
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and to think clean.
I knew I didn't put the pills in my bag yet", Šadeiko talks about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the clean sheet and move on with a new momentum.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to watch the suffering of the ward, but she realized that the athlete must first of all come to terms with himself.
After all, he was so buried by everyone.
It was difficult to tolerate.
Grit, however, said that he would not give up and would like to prove to himself what he was worth,” says Mägi.
Now there is some kind of peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points at the Götzis Multi-Competition.
In a high-level competition, he repaired his own top brand in a ball thrust with nearly a metre (13.89) and ran in a barrier run near the record.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not the ceiling of abilities at all, but that only the first starvation of the competition was extinguished.
Mägi, who supervised him for years, says that Šadeiko is a pattern student.
He is a ready athlete, it is good to train him.
If something does a problem or is wrong, he will say it immediately.
He knows his body and trusts his own feeling.
That's what we have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Šadeiko.
I'm not the kind of person who does the maximum in training," he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Baby happiness of loved ones makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Šadeiko by the happiness of their loved ones.
Both his former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents and the multi-competitor has received support from new weather citizens.
It's been quite interesting," says Šadeiko.
One alcohol the drinking of which equals the "training" of the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is a wine fan so big that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but about the "very active" wine tasting process.
Sniffing glass, twisting wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste arises from the way in which wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the way the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates the taste of wine", says Sheperd.
Things that still affect how wine tastes are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that the wine is not to get drunk.
There must be more in action, he says.
If you take too much a sip, the system will be oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking can do harm to the brain instead of benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are at risk.

Narcos 3rd season commercial clip: now that Pablo Escobar is gone, Cali Cartel will be at the centre of the hit series on Netflix
Despite the fact that in the second season of Narcos, the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first of them has already produced an advertising clip that teases the series with new bad people.
In the third season, the DEA pays attention to the world's richest drug business organization, the Cali cartel.
They operate under the direction of the four powerful godfathers "like the Fortune 500 company", simply with more bribery to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) of its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) leads links with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.

Other new actors include Matias Bravo, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" will be launched on 1 September.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the United Nations Relief and Works Mission, said that hundreds of women are candidates for local council elections, three women are candidates for Vice-Presidentship, and more than 30 percent of recently registered voters are women.
It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of women's role," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban, for its part, has threatened an electoral process coinciding with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is handed over peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women in democracy will increase the success of Afghanistan.
According to independent media reports from Afghanistan, 1.2 million women out of 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A trip from the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans
Straw-weaved bags are a summer classic, which has become a hit product in recent years, which one of the right summer lovers has to hang on their hands and to which traders have been able to weld a price tag appropriate to the hit, regardless of its modest origin.
A bag woven from straw is probably one of the things that everyone has once had in life and the possession of which has not caused any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it does not, there is nothing broken.
Now, however, straw bags are making a real race and fashion fans have changed their fancy designer bags to simple bags woven from straw for the summer months.
It is not just a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and the bravest women even walk to the office with it.
Here, however, it is worth making it clear first whether the summer look of the boss is still sitting or whether it is worth pushing the notebook and laptop to a slightly more formal sum.
However, the variety of straw bags has made women's real summer love.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that is noticed is that fashion gourmands are the first thing on the local market to travel and buy themselves some straw bags that will be faithful to the whole holiday period and that will accompany you on the beach, on the market and also with friends on the town.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
At the same time, it is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so high that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably be subjected to each other by hand to become the happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, this kind of madness is also understandable, because rarely are these times when it is possible to buy a thing that has risen to the status of a hit in the fashion world for just a few dozen euros.
True, clever traders have also discovered a simple way to make money here, and so the finest luxury brands sell straw bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Obviously, so that wealthier customers do not have to feel like simple mortals, who are promoting around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana a straw bag over a thousand euros.
However, for the interpretation of Chanel's straw bag, you can go out in the amount of 6000 euros.
However, unlike most fashion hits, straw bags do not come from a few big fashions, but their story originated from farther away.
Namely, straw bags are supposed to come from far away from the Philippines, from where they have been transported to the wide world.
Weaving a bag of straw is primarily an export business there, and the locals do not often see it going around with them.
It is said that the straw plaiting technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite similar to conventional basket weaving.
However, since the straw bag does not have to be woven as strongly as the basket, patterns and other materials can be embedded in it, which make the bag more personal and therefore attractive.
For example, in recent times there have been particularly trendy bags with coloured ribbons or leather strips.
However, the handbags can first and foremost send a letter of thanks to the actor Jane Birkin, the biggest of whom had not been seen before.
Namely, he matched the straw bag to all kinds of outfits, and he didn't even think much of it to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, the fact that they are taken care of by a rooster head and unlike all other sums, they do not have to be taken care of by special means, but also by water and a wet towel does not play a smaller role in the popularity of bags today.
As always in the case of trendy beatings, besides the classic appearance, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a braided shoulder bag or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic straw bag never goes out of fashion, but the straw side does.
But what is the classic straw bag?
For centuries, it has been considered classic that a bag of straw braided, resembling a basket in its style, has been open from the top and is short, as well as straw, handles.

GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie's Glasgow factory
The trade union expects the heads of the cookie manufacturer McVitie's to confirm long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has silenced about the future of the investment in the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work in a factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said they have invested more than £5 million in the last few years of the facility.
Employees and trade union presidents "are the first to hear" were hired there when something changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland's company, McVitie, called on "to address concerns about the financing not being used to modernise production lines".
Drew Duffy, GMB's Senior Organizer, said: "The fact that we do not get clear on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan from the site's main director is a cause for deep concern to our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, as an essential pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, against the background of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in production, there is an urgent need for a thriving company in McVitie."
Pladis spokesperson said: "The site manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting took place between employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with our employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our activities - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested over 5 million pounds on the Tollcross site, most of which has gone into production lines and improvement of operations.
We fully understand the heritage of Tollcross as a production object, and should there be any change in the operation of the object, the employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up trying to lure Neymar into his ranks by making an offer of £189 million to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record conquest?
This haunting approach has opened a summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record of buying over, which was set last season with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United for £89 million.
Once the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and also the most paid professional athlete in the world, who will be hired by PSG for over £500 000 a week after the payment.
Barcelona is, of course, angry because of both the approach and the break-up of Neymar, although a source close to Catalans' board of directors confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football player since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the president of the PSG warn of such an opportunity in the football world three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matut in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who were thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll meet them and get in touch with those players," Al-Khelaif said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign a contract with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG's central player Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could have a setback as a result of this interest by losing one of its expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to kick the wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland", Varadkar warned Northern Ireland on his first visit after taking office in June.
I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and since it cannot, then to remain part of the European common market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "I am sure we could have one with Great Britain."
An alternative to this would be to return to the customs offices, which would declare historical division and political failure.
The "barrier to trade, prosperity and peace", the Irish Prime Minister said.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that the result could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of Northern Ireland's main parties on a visit to Belfast.
Märt Avandi, who has passed his first semi-long triathlon: everyone can pass Ironman.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital of Otepää, when nearly a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries entered the half-long Ironman competition.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi also won the first triathlon of his life.
I thought it would be difficult and in the end it was complicated," said Avandi at the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that in fact the triathlon is affordable for almost everyone.
Not distance kills, but pace kills," he said, implying that almost everyone reaches the finish line at an affordable pace.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Oti physique is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim."
Avandi had been working hard since February.
At first, 4-5 hours a week, but later, already ten hours a week.
With a time of 05:34:12 he reached 270th overall.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05.06:37), he won other competitors in the so-called "prominent class".
Tanel Padar, who was a "good example person" last year, lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The overall winner of the calculation of the men of the Otepää stage in the Ironman series was the German Johannes Moldan with a time of 3:58:27, and the best of the Estonians was Ivo Suur with a time of 04:14:9.
Among the women, the Danish Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 04:24:01, while the Estonians defeated Maria Jänes, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour and became 04:58:58.
Avandi passed a 1.9 km swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in the 410th position.
