Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have been shocked by the recommendation to convert them into MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
The theme has started from the plan to change the name of the National Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends at the National Assembly are concerned that this can lead to ridicule.
One of the members of the National Assembly, which belongs to the householders, said that his groupmates were concerned because it gleamed with the words “Twp and Pwp”.
To explain to readers outside of Wales: the Welsh word daft means nappy and pwp means kakat.
A member of the album said that the whole group is “not happy” and has proposed other names.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said that his group was "receptively" about name change, but noted that the word "MWP" was very similar to the word "Muppet".
For explanation: in Welsh, the pronunciation of the letter w is similar to that of Yorkshire's English language u pronunciation.
The National Assembly Committee, which currently drafts a draft law on name change, said: “The final decision on all names calling members of the National Assembly, of course, is made by the members themselves.”
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on name proposals, which would support the idea of rebranding the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘WMPs or members of the Welsh Parliament’, but the public poll participants were most favoured by the option ‘MWP’.
The members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement may prove to be a challenge to President Elin Jones, who should submit a draft law on changes in the coming weeks.
The reform act also includes other changes in the principles of work of the National Assembly, including the rules for deprivation of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of the members of the National Assembly will remain with the members themselves during the legislative debate.
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the name of the state
On Sunday, voters vote on whether to rename their country as the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
A referendum is held with the aim of settling the dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia, for decades.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents the claim in that territory and has repeatedly raised objections to the application of EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes a referendum on name change, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, the voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, claim that the change of name is only the price that the state would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's watches are silent because the churches of Harlem are suffering from difficulties
Older people I have talked to have said that there was a bar and a church in the old days,” said Mr. Adams.
No more either.
He said that bar losses are understandable.
People communicate differently today,” he said.
The bars are no longer neighborhood living spaces where people stay every day."
However, as regards churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not continue for as long as the leaders hope, and “ sooner or later they will be back from the beginning”.
Adams added that churches can be replaced with apartment buildings, where the apartments are full of people who do not give help to the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
The vast majority of those who purchase apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who will therefore speed up the day when all these churches close their doors, as it is unlikely that most of the people living here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis − Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The congregation of Blacks, who had worshiped God so far, took over the ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church, headed by the African-American congregation, was occupied by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the Harlem main shopping street in the boycott against 125th Street shoppers if they refused to hire or promote blacks.
In the fire of 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of the father Johnson congregation planned to restore the building, they adopted a carillon or clock game.
The son and heir of Father Johnson in St Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson proudly called the livestock "the bells of the poor."
However, the expert who played the quarry in July gave it a second name: the ‘cultural value’ and the ‘essential historical instrument’.
Professor Tiffany Ng from Michigan also noted that it was the world’s first carillon, played by Black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a bigger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
The history of architects and contractors, some of whom have been accompanied by the secular leaders of the church, and other bishoprics, has been played in St. Martin’s Church in recent months.
In July, the governing body of the church, i.e. the secular leaders, complained to the bishopric in writing that the bishopric ‘will try to pass on costs’, although it was not even associated with the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some of the members of the association complained of the poor transparency of the acts of the bishopric.
In California, the shark injured a 13-year-old boy diving into lobsters
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who plunged into lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place just before seven o’clock in the morning near Beacon’s Beach in Encinita.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving for about half an hour with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's app screams and then swam up to help the boy get out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for getting lobster, but “it understood that the boy shouted “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His whole angular bone was bare,” said Hammel, describing the view he saw when he arrived at the boy.
I cried out to everyone to come out of the water: “There is a shark in the water!” added Hammel.
A life-threatening boy was taken by plane to Rady’s Children’s Hospital in San Diego.
The type of shark attacked is unknown so far.
The lifeguard and captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that the sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was established that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to the Porto Beach in Ecinita for 48 hours for research and safety purposes, from Casablad to Swami.
Giles added that there are more than 135 types of hospitals in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s take over the chains of Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, creating supermarket-like beauty aisles with expert advisers.
As part of an important intrusion on the UK’s 2.7 billion pounds of beauty market, which continues to rise as fashion and household goods continue to be sold, wider spreads of beauty products are tested in 11 shops across the country, making them successful in other stores next year.
Beauty products are invested because supermarkets are looking for ways to take advantage of the previously allocated storage space for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
In Sainsbury, he said he plans to double the selection of his beauty products up to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees also give more space in branded areas, as is currently available in Boots stores.
Also, the supermarket re-enters its own makeup range Boutique, in which most products are suitable for vegans, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop tests exclusive license in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one opened this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and switching to the daily purchase of small quantities of food from local grocery stores means supermarkets need to try more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, has said that outlets are becoming more and more similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight low-cost chains like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, the same has been made with Habitats outlets, since both chains purchased two years ago, which has reportedly supported the sales of food products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The earlier attempt of Supermarket to upgrade its beauty and therapeutic departments ended with failure.
Sainsbury experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the beginning of the 2000s, but it ended with a shelf on how to share the income from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets with each other.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its 281 son's pharmaceutical business to Celesi for £125 million for three years, with the entire Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
The strategy also plays a role in Lloyds, adding luxurious skin care products to its four store range, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Business Officer at Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of the aisles of our beauty products to improve the environment around our customers.
We have also spent money on employees who have received special training and are always willing to advise.
Our range of brands meets every need, while an attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive place to trade in beauty, which can change the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million deal
The Dragons Den's star Peter Jones left the " furious," when TV TV director Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million deal in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby lacks time for the homewear brand Truly.
The business of the couple is compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The 37-year-old TV show “This Morning” manager announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den’s star to enter into Peter Jones’ anger, stepping out of their luxurious lifestyle brand action in the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said that Jones was “furious” when a TV star girl admitted at a tense meeting that took place on Tuesday at Marlows Buckinghamshire, the headquarters of the man’s business empire, that his new contracts worth £1.5 million mean that the woman no longer has enough time to commit to the brand of homewear and clothing Truly.
The business is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and was thought to double Willoughby’s estimate of a £11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby reported on Instagram that he left Truly, Jones left Britain for a holiday home.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main preference.
It was supposed to secure his farther future, therefore the woman thought herself to be dealing with it for a couple of next decades.
His decision to leave left all of the things left to be completely puzzled.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to the product range.
Marlow’s headquarters have a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items.”
Experts believe that leaving the TV show “This Morning”, one of the most paid celebrities in Britain, can pay millions to the company, because the selection of products ranges from sofa pillows and candles to clothes and homewear is invested in a hefty amount of money, and may result in the later launch of the product.
This can mean the end of one long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and her wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as the chairman in March.
Couples go together on holiday trips and Jones has a 40% stake in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby becomes M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin’s ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity” TV series.
One of Jones’ close sources last night said: “I don’t want to comment on his business.”
Hard talk, “after what we fell in love”
Trump joked about the criticism of news for the comment that some consider “worthy to the President” and for excessive positivity towards the head of state in North Korea.
Why has President Trump abandoned so many?
Trump said with his somewhat “news anchor voice”:
I have not given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump had welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the abandonment of North Korea’s nuclear weapons.
However, negotiations for non-proliferation have been suspended.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the "reaction" to the initial disarmament steps in North Korea.
She noted that the US will continue to impose pressure on the country in the future.
Trump’s focus on encouraging speech was much happier.
We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
The war with North Korea was about to begin.
Millions of people would have died.
Now everything is very well between us.”
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have brought good results: completed missile attempts, helped to free hostages, and was arranged to bring the remains of American servants to their homeland.
He also protected his unusual communication with Kim.
It’s very simple to be presidential, but instead of letting 10 000 people wait outside to get to this full-topped stadium, it’s better if we have nearly 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd ahead.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the island of Indonesia, killing hundreds of people
In the event of the elimination of the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their help would not be needed.
Although more than ten per cent of the population had to be relocated, a national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
Unfortunately, they have often clearly expressed that they do not want international help, so the stories are a bit complicated,” said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children assembles a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Authority, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palu, in order to decide whether international authorities are allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the state has been surprisingly little prepared to deal with the natural force.
Although the tsunami of the shelter has been built in Aceh, they are not particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given about the tsunami, the obvious absence of the tsunami alert siren probably increased the number of deaths.
Travelling between numerous Indonesian islands is also quite challenging in the best times.
Natural disasters make the logistics there even more complicated.
A hospital ship suspended in Lombok to treat earthquake victims goes to Palu, but it takes at least three days to get to the new scene of an accident.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesian disrupted infrastructure a central part of his election campaign and has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, budget deficits threaten Mr Joko’s government, as new elections will stand ahead next year.
Mr. Jokot also pressures the tensions in Indonesia among those who are kind, where the majority of Muslim community members have turned to a more old-minded form of faith.
More than 1000 people were killed, and tens of thousands left their homes due to the struggles between Christian and Muslim forces on the streets, using machetes, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge strikes a tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing at Chelsea Premier League, hitting a state of play at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge was fed by Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 meters from Chelsea Gate, when his team led 1:0.
He created the ball left of him before he created it in the direction of a distant post.
The ball flew high above the penal area and hit the upper right corner of the network.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
I just tried to get such a position, access the ball, and players like Shaq pass the ball as much as possible, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for myself,” said Sturridge on LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw the entry coming, I made a single touch and gave a longer, thoughtless blow."
At the end of the first half of the year Chelsea 1: 0 led the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The Blues striker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in this game before turning around on the central square and passing it to Liverpool.
Kovacic gave a quick feed in the middle field.
Then he created a beautiful air bait, leading Hazard to the penal area.
Hazard passed through the defense and created a ball with his left leg from Liverpool player Alisson Becker in the direction of a remote mail network.
Liverpool plays with Naples in the Champions League group on Wednesday at 15.00 in Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA EuroLeague game on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
Indonesia's number of tsunami deaths rose to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state's disaster office said on Sunday morning.
The number of people trapped in the ruins of the buildings that collapsed due to the Friday and the 18-meter giant waves that brought them together due to the 7.5-magnetic earthquake, said the spokesperson of the office at the press conference Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
With over 380 000 inhabitants, the town of Palu was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrests a man of 32 years of age with suspicion of murder after a woman was killed
Murder investigation began this morning after the woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The corpse of 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 in Grayson Mews on John Street on the morning, and a 32-year-old man is arrested with a suspicion of murder.
The police invite people who moved to the area to contact them who could see or hear something.
The police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is just at the very beginning, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers whose onboard cameras could save something, to contact us as they may have important information for our investigation.”
The police spokesman confirmed that a woman found in one of the buildings was a local inhabitant of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, a woman’s alleged friends came to the scene, asking questions about where a woman was found in the morning.
The investigation is underway and the police said that they are informing the close relatives of the woman at the moment.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was bogged when he heard the incident.
Residents were told that getting them back to the house can take hours.
The police officer said to a man that the whole area is now treated as a place of crime.
One woman was at the scene of the event with tears.
He continued to reiterate, “It is terrible.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still closed in the area and the third was right by it.
A number of police officers stood in this area and monitored the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about the event will be asked to send a direct message to their account @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111 using the keyword 30 September log 247.
The shape of Parliament Cromwell is the last monument that is the cause of a "rewriting of history"
The elimination of this would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artefacts in the Taliban style that man’s inhumane followers did.
But Cromwell’s association described Mr. Crick’s recommendation as a foolish and attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was impossible to remain untouched by the monument in front of Oliver Cromwell’s Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not plunder images in the English Civil War himself or command others to do so.
Perhaps Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas, the ancestor of the wrong man.
The great Cromwell presentation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of the person to whom a number of people think should still be honored.”
Mr Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people looked rather at the end of the 19th time than today Cromwell Parliament’s defence against external pressure and, of course, against royal power.
Whether it is an accurate reflection is an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the future development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents this gap in one side.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.”
Chinese farmer steered to death with a killer
According to local media coverage, a farmer was killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China.
A man who was identified only by the surname Yuan, was found deadly and blood-covered by an larvae from the Liupanshui market in Guizhou Province, reported the South China newspaper Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, the pork keeper prepared to vaccinate pigs in China, Xining, Qinghai Province.
He was said to have come on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the adjacent band was open.
He said that there was a big blemish with a bloody mouth.
The examination of the forensic examination confirmed that 249.47 kilograms of the oracle had, according to the report, hurled the farmer to death.
My cousin’s feet were completely bloody and smiling,” the newspaper “Guiyang Evening News” conveyed the words of the victim’s cousin Wu.
Security camera recordings showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found almost an hour later.
The man killed the animal did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking someone else until the police gather evidence at the scene of the incident.
Yuan’s family and market leaders claim to discuss the payment of compensation for man’s death.
Although rarely, it has also been observed in the past that pigs attack people.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294.83 kilograms nailed to the Welsh farmer’s tractor until the husband’s wife scared the animal away.
When in 2012, a Oregon farmer ate his own pigs, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were usually not attacked, but due to the taste of blood, he could go away with them.
They are simply playful.
They are very curious marathons whose goal is not to hurt.
They just need to be respected enough,” the man said.
Hurricane Rosa gusts bring extensive rain to the south-west of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens, moving across the north coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring flooding rains to North Mexico and to the south-west of the USA.
On Sunday morning at 05:00 Eastern Coast time classification Rosa 136.78 kilometers per hour with blowing winds to the first category of hurricane, located 69.59 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure area begins to form above the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the US, and when Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to direct deep tropical moisture towards the southwest of the US.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25.4 centimetres of rain.
Thereafter, the response of the approaching low pressure to tropical humidity in the south-western part of the country creates extensive heavy rainfall in the coming days.
At times, 2.54 to 10.16 centimetres of rain caused by dangerous sudden floods, floodwater and potential landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in the precipitation rate from five to about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Also, precipitation of 5,08 to 10.16 centimetres is expected in certain south-western regions of the US, especially Arizona.
Sudden beams are possible under rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
Be sure not to move on foot in the desert in the event of a risk of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to turn into high-flow rivers, and thunderstorms are accompanied by occasional gusts of wind and volatile dust.
The approaching low-pressure area sometimes leads to violent rainfall in the Southern California coastal areas.
It is possible to have a total precipitation rate of more than 1.27 centimetres and can cause less flood water and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rainfall starts to approach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, rain showers become extensive on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rains reach Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations are predicted in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, while in tropical areas temperatures remain high.
Sometimes it leads to large temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday weather is a great example of significant temperature differences in the central US.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range from almost 20 degrees.
The next few days, we are trying to collect long summer heat again.
Much of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to start a warm October month with temperatures around 80 degrees Celsius, from the southern plains to the northeast of the country.
In New York, 26.6 degrees of warmth are expected on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the east of the US there is a probability of high average temperatures in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s court session was reviewed by over 20 million people
Over 20 million people looked through six television channels on Thursday at the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the female Christine Blasey Ford, who reportedly accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political jam continued where broadcasters stopped showing the usual broadcasts for Friday last minute turns: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drew up a contract for the FBI to conduct a one-week indictment investigation.
Ford said to the Senate's Legal Commission that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh shouted her drunk head and tried to tear her clothes off at the end of the high school.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely sure that it did not happen.
According to the Nielsen report, the transfer was likely to be reviewed by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that indicate it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also typically having trouble calculating the number of people looking at transfers in the authorities.
For comparison, it is about the same audience as football final tournament games or Oscars share.
Fox News Channel’s opinion leaders, who have strongly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day’s session, said Nielsen.
ABC with 3.26 million viewers remained second.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
Interest was also great after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the office of a moderate republican, according to which it voted for Kavanaught, CNN and CBS cameras hit a man on Friday morning when he had been hit under the guise of protesters, trying to go with an elevator to a legal commission session.
He stood down for several minutes when he was accused and directly transferred to the CNN.
I stand right here, in front of you,” one woman said.
Do you think he is telling the state the truth?”
They said to him: “You have power while so many women have been fully reached.”
Flake said that his department issued an application and added before the lift was closed that he had more to say at the legal commission session.
The cable distribution and broadcasting networks reflected live broadcasting several hours later than the Legal Commission had to vote in order to forward the nomination of Kanaugh to the plenary session of the Senate.
But Flake said that he only does this in understanding that the FBI will examine the allegations against the candidate that have been claimed by minority democracies next week.
Flake was partly persuaded by a conversation about a friend's Democrat with Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made its decision.
The Flake decision had an impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not be able to meet the votes of Kanaugh without the confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation in connection with the Indictments of Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of political play
In an interview with Sunday Times, the Prime Minister accused those who would consider his plans to leave the European Union in a “political game” of damage to the future of Britain and national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with a newspaper with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson put pressure on his attack on May in the direction of the Brexit agenda, saying that the proposal on which to collect tariffs from Britain and the EU is “completely brain-free”.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson Suspected by LSU Player Murdered
The police arrested a man suspected of firing at the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison with second-stage murder, said Baton Rouge police station.
The authorities released a video of opposition between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson DNA, the CBS-owned TV channel WAFB informed.
After interviewing Simpson, the police said that the man had admitted shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer reported that the male bail was set against USD 350 000 (€308 600.30).
On Friday, East Baton Rouge's coroner issued a preliminary report, according to which the death of the bulleth in his head was caused by the death of the head in the neck area.
The district would like to thank the operational group of the state police refugees in Louisiana, the state police crime laboratory, the Southern University police, and the people living in the region for the help given in the investigation, which led to the arrest of the suspect.
Joe Alleva, LSU Sports Manager, thanked the regional law enforcement bodies for “seeding to diligence and justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98-metre-long man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in the LSU.
The average of his last season’s games was 5.6 points and 2.6 table balls.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the entire team had been “hit” and “shocked” due to the death of Wayde.
It’s something you’ll ever worry about,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts ashes above Mexico City
The ash erupting from the popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday by instructing them to stay away from the volcano, as the crater again began an action that resulted in 183 gas emissions and ash eruptions being recorded within 24 hours.
The centre monitored several noises and tremors.
Images shared in social media depicted ash-covered car windshields in different regions of Mexico City, such as Xochimilcos.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital after the 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Police encounters clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the clash of protesters from independent advocates with the riot police, and thousands joined oppositions to celebrate the anti-state vote on the withdrawal.
A group of masked-separation-promoting fighters, held back by the riot police, attacked the latter with eggs and powder paint, creating thick dust clouds on the streets, usually full of tourists.
Scrambles also arose later, when the police had to use the thiefs to control the fights.
Many hours of “No forgetfulness, no forgiveness” sung by the followers of independence clashed with the protesters in favor of the unity of the state, who exclaimed “Long live Spain!”.
According to the local press, 14 people who suffered minor injuries were given medical care.
Tensions continue to be in support of independence in the region a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum that took place on 1 October unlawful, but still marked by the fact that the Catalans were in favour of isolation.
Voters decided overwhelmingly in favour of independence, although election activity was low, because those against the withdrawal ignored the vote extensively.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year when the police tried to suppress the vote in front of voting districts across the region, leading to violent clashes.
The proponents of independence had spent Friday night in front of voting districts in order to avoid demonstrations supported by the national police.
However, the demonstrations took place, but had to take another path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the demonstration of isolation with his wife, said that he no longer had hope for the prospect of seeing Catalonia as independent.
Last year, one of the best moments of our lives took place.
I saw my parents cried about the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite the significant but small victories in the regional elections in December last year, it has been difficult for the political parties supporting the Catalan independence to maintain their will this year, as a number of well-known leaders have either gone into exile or have been detained and are awaiting a trial of their role in organising a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who saves police support support with his mobile phone, said that the quarrels were incited by politicians from both sides.
The situation is becoming more and more intense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol announced in Junquera, one of the nine leaders of the Catalans who have been involved in the European Parliament elections since last year.
Applying for elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the withdrawal of democratic values and the pressure statements of the Spanish Government,” he said.

The case took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. in British time.

You could also have a bow arrow in the direction of the car at some point.
Menga blow gives Livingston 1–10 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston returned victory
Promoted by Livingston boged Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to another loss in 18 games, during which the man has been a manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's blow turned out to be decisive when Gary Holt raised the level in seconds to Hibernian.
Gerrard will remain unwined in the first league this season and will face leading Hearts the next Sunday, who will be on the ground with eight points.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna will be hosted in the EuroLeague on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded his invincible attack to seven games, while the chief coach Holt still felt the taste of loss since the last month of the replacement of Kenny Miler.
Livingston loses the chance of blunt visitors
The Holt team should have managed long before the goal was scored, as their immediate style of play caused all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through defense, but his efforts roared before the goal, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to hit Craig Halkett over the goal.
Hosts were calmly letting Rangers play in front of themselves, knowing that they could cause problems for guests in certain places.
And it's also a way to score the determining gate.
Rangers gave up a free shot and Livingston had an opportunity to play the Declan Gallagher, Robinson, and Menga, who took the ball and managed to do so from the middle of the penal area.
By that time, Rangers were mostly possession of a ball, but could not penetrate through the defense, which is why the guard of Liam Kelly was all calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend the gate.
The goalkeeper, Allan McGregor, was driven by Scott Pittman's blow, and Lithgow brilliantly shone in Livingston's next teaming.
The strikes were constantly hit in and out of Livingston's punishment area, and two penalty kicks were also directed to go, one to replace Halkett's Glenn Middleton, and the other to touch the ball with his hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaron Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, exceeding expectations when moving up the ladder.
Their style of play and players have hardly changed since the high-end return, but Holt has to be honored for how he has hardened the team since he arrives.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a huge, perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worralt throughout the game on the hind legs.
However, on the Rangers, there was a lack of inspiration.
Despite being at a good level under the leadership of Gerrard, it was not enough to follow the example here.
Their last possession of the ball turned out to be incomplete: the arrival at home only took place once, which could act as an alarm to the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan controversial reception in Cologne
Berlin had both smiles and clouds on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met in the morning.
This is the last day of the conflicting visit of President Erdogan to improve relations between NATO allies.
They are left aside for human rights, freedom of press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting the gathering of 25 000 people in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared close to see their president.
Hundreds of people protested against Erdogan, much of whom are deaf, also made their voice heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to host the Turkish President in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude towards the guest is divided: some of the Turks living in Germany greet him as a hero, while others despise a man as a self-governing man.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: the cyclist killed the car as a result of a collision
In London, a cyclist who had erupted the car was killed.
The collision took place on a high-speed road near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street junction in Deptford, in the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. in British summertime.
The driver stopped and help came to give ambulance doctors, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place a few months after the other cyclist died in a collision close to two kilometers from the Saturday's accident scene at the Childs Street, where the driver who ran out of the scene fled the rider.
The London police said that authorities deal with the identification of a man and with the information of his relatives.
Traffic at the scene is closed and buses redirected, motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 prison officers injured in unrest
The Prison Board announced that six prison officers were highly injured in the riots of the men’s prison.
Restlessness broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 09:30 a.m. and has not yet ended.
Expert riot police officers are involved in dealing with one wing of concentrated riots involving eight prisoners.
Prison officers were treated with minor facial injuries at the scene of the event.
The spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been invited to deal with the current case in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five team members received medical care due to injuries.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, is handed over to the police and their prison sentence may be extended.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison leader was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the riot police were called into prison to silence the serious riots during which prison officers were attacked by billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City by storms (the hurricane may be beneficial for drought areas)
Tropical low pressures often do not hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when the ragy hurricane Rosa moves across the US south-west of the desert, leading to the risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already organised a follow-up on Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona, in the south and east of Nevada, in the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the region with rain on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones of Phoenix have maintained 321.86 kilometres of tropical storms or low pressure levels!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane passing 64.37 kilometers from the border of Arizona.”
The latest national Hurricane Center models predict rain from 5.08 to 10.16 centimetres, which can reach 15.24 centimeters in the limited areas of the Arizona Mogollon RIMI.
In other desert areas in the south-west of the USA, including the central part of the Rockies and the Great cousin, precipitation is likely to range from 2.54 to 5.08 centimeters, reaching 10.16 centimeters in limited areas.
Rosa precipitation can be a blessing in areas that can withstand sudden floods, as the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rains are also likely to be beneficial, as in South-West America drought reigns.
According to the US drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, i.e. the second-largest category drought, informed weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa Baja California's peninsula crosses Mexico land.
Rosa, which was still on the hurricane level on Sunday morning with the largest wind gusts of 6.43 kilometers per hour, is currently 619.95 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at 19.31 kilometres north of the hour.
The storm comes into contact with the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean and, therefore, falls a little.
Thus, Rosa is expected to reach Mexico land with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The amount of precipitation in certain regions of Mexico can be large, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
From Baja California to Sonora, rain can be expected, with a total of 7.62 to 15.24 centimetres, reaching at times up to 25.4 centimeters,” weather.com reported.
Then Rosa heads over to the north as a tropical storm in Mexico, reaching the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, moving over Arizona and arriving to the south of Utah on Tuesday late night.
The main danger following Rosa or its aftermath is the very strong rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and in the desert of the southwest of the USA,” said the National Hurricane Center.
These rainfall can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floodwater in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests related to the murder test
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested with a suspicion of an upheaval of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 British Summer Time.
The victim was taken to a hospital in a “stable” state.
The 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock region of Avon and Somerset, the police said.
Officials ask everyone who may have mobile phone recordings of the incident to contact.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “beared” by the Democratic Party “under wickedness and anger”
The support of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in his speech at Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “beared” during his appointment process during the democratic party’s “needs and anger”.
Kavanaugh gave testimony to the Congress on Thursday, a fiercely and sensitively rejecting the charges of Christine Blasey Ford, according to which the man attacked him several decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the meeting, Ford also issued a certificate of accusations.
The President said on Saturday that “America saw the glory, quality, and courage of Kavanaugh this day”.
The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is to appoint one of the most valued lawyers of our time with an impeccable background in public service,” he said to the supporting crowd in West Virginia.
The President implicitly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, at the same time speaking of the importance of the election activity of the Republic in interim elections.
Five weeks have been left until one of our most important choices of life.
I’m not applying, but in fact I’m applying” he said.
That’s why I am everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump claimed that democrats are on a mission that aims to “stand against and prevent”.
The first main procedural vote on the Senate floor on the application process is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, told the senior CNN of the leaders of the Republican party.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of deaths rise
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away when giant waves entered the beach after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawes Island in Indonesia, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together to the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when six metres of waves were set up on the beach during their effulgence, killing a number of people and destroying everything that remained on the road.
Tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnetic earthquake.
If there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people still did their activities on the beach, not immediately fled, thus remaining victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency, at a press conference in Jakarta.
Tsunami did not come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with them, wiping everything from earth,” said Nugroho, adding that tsunami moved in the offshore at 800 km per hour before arriving on the shore.
Some people climbed on trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16 700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 centre.
The air photos published by the disaster administration showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
Follow-up waves in the coastal city also continued on Saturday.
The 2.4 million inhabitants of the area had to feel the wave of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Authority (BPPT) said in its statement that the energy released in Friday after a strong earthquake was nearly 200 times higher than that of the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the long and narrow bay city could increase the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found under the rubbles of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and damage may be higher than Palu in the coastal area north of 300 km called Donggala, which was closer to the middle of the earthquake.
Notifications from Donggala “is incomplete and contain no information”, said Nugroho.
More than 300 000 inhabitants live in the region,” said the Red Cross in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
It is already a tragedy that can go even worse,” he said.
The occupation was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing tsunami Palu in the city, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach while the warning was issued.
The amateur footage on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building who warns people moving on the street from the approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars with you.
Reuters did not succeed immediately in confirming the correctness of the material.
Earthquake and tsunami caused extensive power outages that prevented communication in the Palu area and made it difficult for authorities to organise rescue works.
The army has started sending transport planes that provide assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuators still desperately need food and other essentials.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue operations, otherwise being closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths due to Indonesia's tsunami increased by over 800.
This is very bad.
Although the World Vision staff from Donggala safely reached the town of Palu, where they are in the shadows of their presenttelks set in the yard of their office, they saw the disgusting views on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
This is very bad.
Although the auxiliary forces were vigorously engaged in disaster relief operations, some complained that large experienced foreign support organisations were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and auxiliary troops from abroad can only be sent if the scene of an accident is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
It continues to be a catastrophe at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross of Indonesia.
When the government says, “Ok, it is a national disaster,” we can start receiving international aid, but such a situation has not yet been proclaimed.”
When the second night Paul arrived after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, the friends and families of the lost people were still full of hope that their loved ones would be those wonderful cases that would ease the grimness of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of the well.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was trapped under the rubbles two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national team of slide shadows, trained two missing slide shadows for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of the hotel trapped in Roa Roa are her students, added Mr. Mandagi.
As a senior slide chute, I have a personal load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke about how he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors of the beach festival after spreading the Roa hotel news among the slide parachute community.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey checkmark instead of two blue checkers.
I think this means that messages did not arrive,” he said.
Thieves took on 23 585.88 euros while filling an ATM at Newport on the Leves
On Friday morning, the thefts stolen EUR 23 585.88 from an employee of Brink, who fills the Leves ATM, was published in a press release of the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied the ATM at the entertainment establishment and prepared to bring more money, wrote a detective in the press release of Dennis McCarthy.
When the man worked, the other man ran behind a Brink employee, and stole a bag for delivery that was full of money.
The witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, write a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about early persons is asked to contact Newport police by phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper takes his new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
On Saturday, when he reported a change on Twitter, he wrote: “The former Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change takes place before his performance by sending Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show, who cancelled his concert “because of feelings”, said the author of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for the present male performer, West has previously stated that it is a religious word for him.
I think “ye” is one of the most commonly used words in the Bible, which means “you” there,” said West earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, we are.
I changed my name from Kanye, which means “this one”, called Ye, which is only a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion, and everything else.
The album is a more reflection of who we are.”
Kanye West is not the only rapper to play with her name.
Sean Combsi is known mainly under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also used his name with a hyphen and without it, with uppercase and lowercase letters.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
At a time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody attacks against students, President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised that he will never use the army against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza that “will never use the army to curb the Mexicans.”
The army attacked the peaceful settlement in the court on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left student movements were confirmed throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying monthly grants to students and opening more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attracts young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of AI.
As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of AI, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a funder and AI actor who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments were published after the various parts of the U.S. government made statements on AI, although the U.S. does not generally have an official AI strategy.
At the same time, China’s plan for last year was to be a player in the renewal of AI by 2030.
The duplication of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US and we are working on the next breakthrough of AI,” Lee said.
Two-time funding would double the probability that the next major AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC this week in an interview.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most prominent AI companies in China Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon with an AI system that won the best Othello player in America, and later served as chairman of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee recognised previous U.S. Government technology competitions such as the Defense Ministry’s Research Projects Agency (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge) and asked when the next competition will take place to help identify the next dreamers.
U.S. researchers need to work hard to get funding from the government,” said Lee.
China is not the one who takes over intellectuals, they are companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired scientists from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes could help the US support AI efforts.
I think people who have received a PhD in the field of AI should be offered a green card automatically,” said the man.
The Chinese Council of State published the next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
China’s National Fund for Natural Sciences distributes funding to people working in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Fund and other government agencies allocate money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a combined Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve partners from both industry and industry, but the White House announced the establishment of a selected committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it began to finance the $2 million AI Next initiative.
However, the national research fund is currently funded by more than $100 million per year in research related to AI.
At the same time, the US legislation, which was intended to establish the National Security Commission for AI, has not been amended.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the state name
On Sunday’s referendum, Macedonians voted on whether to change the country’s name into the Republic of Macedonia, a step that would also solve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the approval of Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on that territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments of the two countries agreed on a new name for Macedonia, but anti-ethnic people argue that the name would harm the national personality of the Macedonian Slavs population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he was not going to participate in the referendum and that the Ignorance Campaign had raised doubts as to whether the voter’s activity would reach the 50% participation rate necessary for the referendum to take effect.
In the referendum, you are asked: “Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price paid by Macedonia, which is one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure association with organisations such as the EU and NATO.
I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, as it means safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, aged 79 in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they follow the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
Two-thirds of Parliament's majority are required for the change of names.
The National Electoral Committee said that as at 13:00 there were no reports of irregularities.
However, election activity was only 16 per cent compared to the 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted on the Macedonian referendum to change the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising the chairs in front of the tents to those who ignore the referendum.
We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the doors of our servants,” said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not wish to receive us as Macedonia, we may contact others, such as China and Russia, and receive from the integration of Europe-Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would mobilise more than 20 investments in Macedonia at the unemployment rate.
I believe that a large majority supports the change of name, as more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of belonging to the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said that “yes-word” would be “confirmation of our future”.
The results of the study published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies revealed that 30 to 43 per cent of voters were planning to take part in the referendum, which is below the required election activity.
A survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telema TV revealed that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would respond “yes”.
The rate of success of a referendum is 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western policy of the government after the government took over the governance of May last year.
Watch: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero goes on a gate through all of Brighton's defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling invaded Brighton by securing the Manchester City 2–0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero impressed like his goal scored at the 65th game minute was ridiculously easy.
The Argentine striker passed through the central field at the beginning of the sequence.
He invaded the three guardians of Brighton before arriving in an open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He invaded another defender before running past several players on the border of Brighton's penal area.
Then he created the ball from himself to the left with Sterling.
The English striker used the first strokes to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the Brighton Guard Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
Aguerol has problems with his legs,” said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola for reporters.
We said he was playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We were lucky to set up a gate at that point.”
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial success in the struggle of Premier League.
The goal was scored in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in this game clearly on Brighton's territory.
He sent the ball nicely from the air to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane was able to hit the ball a few times before leading Sterling further.
Sky Blues created the ball further into the grid just before it slipped out of its limits.
Manchester City plays in the Champions League in Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 Rhein–Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the thriller against Rockies
When the Nationalists were eliminated from the final tournament games, there was no big reason for the new start.
However, a fierce-hearted Scherzer hopes to land Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only when Rockies, who run Los Angeles Dodgers in one game in NL West, still has hope to get to the final.
Rockies secured a runner-up at least with 5–2 wins over Nationals on Friday evening, but the team still wants to secure their first division.
Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least try knowing that playing in Denver in this audience and in another team atmosphere is probably higher than any other game that might be waiting for me this year.
Why shouldn’t I want to compete here?”
Nationals have not called the opening player on Sunday yet, but are said to be inclined to eat Schezer in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be feeding 34, made a warm-up session and feed on Sunday as usual.
This Washington right-handed player runs 18–7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of kicks out of 300, and the favorable opportunities of his 220 2/3 this season.
Trump calls an incentive call in West Virginia
The President implicitly referred to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, at the same time speaking of the importance of the election activity of the Republic in interim elections.
Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime one of the most important elections.
This is a big event in which I don’t apply, but actually apply, so I am present everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You will see this terrible, extremely terrible democrats of the extremist group, you will see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back the power by using any means.You will see their wickedness and dirty game.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive for power and control, the only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don’t give it to them.”
The democrats are, according to him, on a mission aimed at ‘stand up and prevent’.
And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the democrats “grunted, wicked, nefarious, and liars.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, who shouted loudly among the audience.
Remembering his answer?
Did you leak this document?
ee, ah, what?
No, no, wait – it was one of the worst examples of body language, in fact the worst body language I have ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a major association.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinion
When the activists of my local party, Momentum, voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last of the householdists on the list of MEPs to whom you say you are not welcome for expressing your opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan from Parliament became a party to the same treatment as she stood strongly for the anti-Semitic.
In my case, the condemned the condemnation of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are somewhat similar to what Jeremy had in his opinion with previous leaders.
In the Communication from the householdist party of Nottingham East, it was stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and create.”
Most of my experience with the meetings of the Friday evening assembly is exactly that of my eight-year-long local household household member.
Today, unfortunately, this does not apply to most meetings anymore, and the promise to be “breader and more generous” in politics has long been forgotten when it was ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different viewpoints are not acceptable in the Labour Party and for each opinion, the party’s board of directors is judged.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and a co-worker with whom I thought to share his similar political views in the past was waiting now to change my mind and embrace the positions I would not otherwise have agreed to, regardless of whether it is a matter of national security or of the EU single market.
Whenever I go public, no matter what I really speak, this condemnation follows on social media, inciting my recall, ignoring the party's policy and saying that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And this is not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my co-workers, because my comments towards me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and determination of fellow workers who face sexist or racist abuses every day, but never swear.
One of the most frustrating positions in this policy area is how the levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote tolerance culture.
However, the reality is that we are no longer so much connected, and by changing any ‘untrust’ initiative or election rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice in the past two years to keep my head down, talk less, and “it would be all good.”
But I didn’t have to do it in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, motivated by the care of the government of Thatcher, which had literally left my large school classroom on the verge of collapse, I have tried to talk about the best public services for those who need it most, acting as a local council member and a government minister.
I have never concealed my policy, including in the last elections.
Under no circumstances can anybody at Nottingham East be confused with my political opinions or with my local management regarding the areas of disagreement.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the state is moving towards Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not meant for Nottingham Momentum, but for my followers, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of recall or political consideration will stop me from acting on behalf of what I think is in your best interest.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: The invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have tilted the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves a win in this wonderfully fun Tennis first league game.
They are now the only unbeaten team at the top of ten tables.
Finally, it was a high-level protection of the team and a better risk-taking that led to the victory of the home team and the coach Peter Murchie has the full right to be satisfied.
We have been tested all the time during the games and we are still invincible, so of course I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “I have a story about Ayr, they used their options better than us.”
During Grant Anderson's 14th game minute attempt, which was taken over by Frazier Climo, Ayr was promoted to the Scots captain Rory Hughes, whom was surrendered by Warriors, the yellow card gave Melros an opportunity where Jason Baggot passed the failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayr’s progress with a penalty kick just before the end of the half-year, achieving a half-time position in favour of 17–5 Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half successfully, and Patrick Anderson's test, taken over by Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
After that, a long delay occurred due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was moved on the carrier frame, and as the game continued, Ayr further stepped up thanks to the Stafford McDowall test, which Climo communicated.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson was then a yellow card, but again Melrose's player, Bruce Colvine, paid for a failed attempt to broadcast after a strong pressurization.
However, the team playing on the home square again gained strength, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for the Climo obstruction without a ball on the line, MacPherson put the ball behind the advancing Ayrs.
Climo passed the ball as he did almost immediately after continuing the game, when Kyle Rowe tried David Armstrong's box shot and sent the side guard to Gregor Henry to go on the fifth attempt of the team playing on the home court.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the field of hospitality services after it was discovered that the man was named the director of a renowned restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays in the BBC TV series known by Jack Jarvi, which he writes and shows with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the ninth season ahead will be the last in the series and it seems that Kiernan will make life after Craiglangi's new plans.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but Scottish Sun's source suggested that Kiernan would like to step into Glasgow's booming restaurant business.
The Sea Is Us: Without a Marine Border, Bolivia hopes that the Court will again open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags wave above the buildings of the authority.
The naval bases from the lake of Titicaca to Amazon have a slogan: “The sea is our right.
It is our responsibility to restore it."
In Bolivia, completely without a sea border, the memory of the coastline, which was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, is still alive, with the same living desire to sail again on the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia expects an international court decision to be made on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has an impetus, a spirit of unity and peacefulness, and the state naturally expects an affirmative result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat of Bolivia.
A number of Bolivian people across the country are looking at the decision of an international court on large screens, in the hope that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which after decades of intermittent debate with Bolivia will be obliged to negotiate with the latter on an independent path to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic real-world president, Evo Morales, who is ahead of the conflicting battle for re-election next year, has a lot of weight at stake with the decision of Monday.
We’re very close to returning to the Pacific,” he sweared at the end of August.
However, some of the analysts think that the court is unlikely to vote in favor of Bolivia, or if it would change very little.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands does not have the power to dedicate the territory of Chile and it states that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of an international court is issued only six months after the final statement has been heard suggests that it was not a ‘complex case’, said Paz Zárate, a lawyer of international law in Chile.
And with the further causes of Bolivia going further, the last four years may have worsened the situation.
The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian authorities,” said Zárate.
Morale’s militant talk of beauty has lost all the goodness of the rest of Chile, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile continue to negotiate at some point, but after all, the debate is extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the court was unnecessary.
Monday gives Bolivia an “experiential opportunity to start a new era in country relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end the disagreements with mutual benefits lasting for 139 years”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most well-known presidents of Latin America, uses the sea issue to express political grudges.
Bolivia never gives up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea said that the release of nuclear weapons will not take place until the state cannot trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Meeting.
He called on the United States to review the promises made by competitors’ leaders during the Singapore Summit.
He comments on the time US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems almost to start nuclear diplomacy again more than three months after meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Uni in Singapore.
According to Ri, it is air castles, considering the US continued restrictions and refusal to end the war with Korea will cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington takes such a statement carefully if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards arming.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, skepticism is common, according to which Pyongyang is going to seriously abandon the armaments that the state is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree another Kim and Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Show brings to the viewer a series of massive headgear brought to buyers on shopping streets in their neighborhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you no longer have to look for it.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of odd, oversized headgear to the stages during their summer season in 2019, dazzling the Paris Fashion Week.
High and impractical hats are fashionable this summer through Instagram and these designers have sent their stunning creations to the fashion scene.
Valentino's top piece was an oversupplied beige hat that covered the heads of the models, which was decorated with a wide border reminiscent of feathers.
Other huge items of clothing included jewel-built watermelons, magic hat and even pineapple, but their purpose is not to insulate.
Thom Browne also showed a strange range of masks, making it exactly in time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks were sewn-in mouths, so they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high.
One part of the work resembled a diving costume with an air pipe and glasses, while the other resembled a molten ice cream tuft.
And if you continue with a giant fashion show, you'll be lucky.
Fashion gurus predict that huge headgear can also reach shopping streets near you.
The super-sized hats come immediately on the heels of La Bomba, a 60 centimetre wide shoulder hat that has been seen in all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created a largely impractical hat swelled in social media, sent another large piece to the fashion scene – a beach bag made of straw, which is almost as big as the model with bikini.
The dark orange raffia bag with raffia flairs and white leather sap was the highlight of the 2019 Summer Collection at La Riviera in Paris.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on shopping streets next summer, because the designer has so much impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for huge clothing.”
John Edward: language skills are important for world citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the forefront of the academic top-level rankings, and this continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, strengthened by personal and joint success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where over 30 000 students study across Scotland and are represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best service for their students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for additional and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum for conditions, we see that modern languages are still well-known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you speak to a person in a language that is understandable to him, it will reach him.
When you speak to him in his native language, he will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
In this year’s fresh exam results, we can see that at the top of the tables there are languages in which the rate of passing the exams among private schools is the highest.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high result of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 per cent of students received grade A in Mandarin, the same grade was obtained by 72 per cent of German learners, 69 per cent of French learners, and 63 per cent of Spanish learners.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as essential skills for life that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages that are now among subjects are in private and other school curricula the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that the reasons why employers find it difficult to find job vacancies revealed a lack of language skills among 17% of respondents.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future work.
As more hopeable job offers require language skills, such a skill is becoming essential in a globalising world.
Regardless of the career choices made, the acquisition of a second language gives a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
Ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens gives a competitive advantage to multilingual people.
According to a survey conducted by more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents don’t speak any foreign language well enough to keep that conversation.The only language with a double percentage of the speakers was French with 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to finance language learning for today’s children at the current time.
Possession of several languages, especially languages of developing countries, gives children better opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
A bunch of schools focus on classic modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese, in view of 2020.
Regardless of the child’s interests, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed regardless of what the future will bring them.
It can no longer be denied that languages in a globalised business environment are crucial for the future of the country, which is why it must also be reflected in education.
It is true that modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Private schools continue to offer young Scots choice, diversity and exquisiteness.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Avid admirers no longer have to wait to see LeBron James making his debut at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, a Lakers coach, announced that James would play against Denver Nuggets in the Sunday's pre-season opening game in San Diego.
But the number of his game minutes still needs to be determined.
This is more than one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a count of minutes.
After a training session last week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the six-game pre-season schedule at Lakers.
I don’t need games to warm up at the current stage of my career,” he said.
Trump’s Western Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start his election campaign event series this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump’s first week of campaigning event of five, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on confirmation stands for as long as Trump chooses to appoint for the vacant seat of the Supreme Court, he seeks to increase the support for the upcoming interim elections, as republicans are threatened to lose control of the Congress following the vote in November.
What time is Trump’s tonight campaign event in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump campaign event in Wheeling in West Virginia will take place this Saturday evening on 29 September 2018 at 19:00 on the Eastern Coast time.
Trump’s West Virginia campaign event can be watched online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to talk about the sessions of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in this week, which became tense in connection with sexual misconduct, while the Senate’s confirmation vote has been suspended for the week until the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main goal of the campaign event series is to help new impetus for republicans facing complex elections in November.
Thus, the campaign manager of President Trump said that the goal of these five next week’s events is “incentive volunteers and supporters when republicans try to protect and expand the majority belonging to them in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters mediated.
Checking the Congress is so important for the President’s agenda that Trump travels to as many states as possible when he dives into the fast election campaign season,” said Reuters Trump’s spokesperson, who did not want to mention his name.
Today’s campaign event at the Wesbanco stadium in Wheeling can bring supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and also get coverage in Pittsburgh’s media”, announced West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, it is the second time Trump visits West Virginia in the last month, where he received more than 40 percent of the voters’ votes in 2016.
Trump tries to help the Western Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the rankings on the basis of surveys.
For Morrisey, this is not a good sign that the President has come to stimulate his results,” said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team is nervous about the race, keeping hopes high before Sunday singles
After three unilateral sessions, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were some of the ones that Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging turning point pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sports, but players truly believe in it, especially in competitions like this here.
So where do they think the turning point is right now?
They managed six points, which have now become four, so I think I can consider this as a small turning point,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear as it is guided by four points and there are 12 more points in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they don’t have enough winds sailing, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each received three points out of four.
Spieth has been astounding both for the flank and the green and shows an example.
These win crying from the throat became increasingly loud with each round, hiding the decisive putt that would have led to the tie of the fourth match after he and Thomas were on the ground with the two.
His putt, which won the match on the 15th, sent a similar cries that showed the man's faith that the Americans are not yet out of the competition.
You just have to play more focusedly and worry about your match,” said Spieth.
This is the only thing players can do yet.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have Ryder Cup on the undisputed stars of Francesco Molinal and Tommy Fleetwood
The strange but beloved couple in Europe are four and nothing can go wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple who did not hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, also avoiding bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine Friday morning.
This game and the way in which their energy flows into as noisy crowds as back, reinforces the belief that players with whom to compete on Sunday, and that if the sun sets over Le Golf National, there is no better known player than Fleetwood or Molinari to confirm a possible European victory.
Preferably both different holes at the same time.
Stories about the glory of Europe, however, are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero of today's morning, a quick job when a man was put in pairs with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two doubles in the first nine dug the Spanish and Swedes in such a deep hole that they had no hope to dig themselves out of it.
On Saturday, however, there is no one to help you out in August.
Four-balls and doubles games are extremely attractive to look closely at the communication between pairs, advice given to each other, missed advice, and how the way can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and started to lead the last day with a strong head start, but this session of the fours showed that the US team had a nerve to fight, with some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe to lead Ryder Cup on the last day of 10-6
Europe will be successful on the last day of the Ryder Cup, starting to lead the United States 10-6 after Saturday’s four-balls and doubles matches.
The excellent duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-winning rival Tiger Woods to raise their previous score in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorni's European side, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of a lost cup in Hazeltine, ruled the American side in four-ball in the morning, winning the series 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in doubles, winning two games, but they could not make up for the deficit.
The side of Jim Furyk needs eight points to maintain a cup of 12 single games from Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, with Molina, who is called Molliwood after this wacky weekend, they are the second couple to win four points in their fourth opening match in Ryder Cup’s history.
Having destroyed the four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, subduing the Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeauveel more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who draged himself through two games on Saturday, showed random brilliance, but now lost his 29 four-balls and 19 doubles, receiving seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested for four-ball by the morning, returned to double-play with partner Henrik Stenson, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who ranks first and third in the world rankings.
It did not succeed in Europe, although the competition was held in pleasant and windmill weather south of Paris.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points as the benchmark for Americans on Saturday.
They got a solid victory in four balls of 2-1 over the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning in the doubles in the Pulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3, after losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has returned from a four-point deficit, going to single games, although as owners, the Furyk side only needs a draw to maintain the cup.
Although being second best in two days, after a Sunday counterattack, it seems that they will not succeed.
North Korea says that “not in any case” they do not make themselves unarmed because of lack of confidence unilaterally
The North Korean Foreign Minister said to the UN on Saturday that the continuing restrictions deepened their distrust against the United States and that the state did not intend to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in these conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Organisation’s Annual Meeting that North Korea has taken ‘significant goodwill measures’ over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, demolishing nuclear testing sites and promising nuclear weapons and non-proliferation of nuclear technology.
But we don’t see the US responding to it,” he said.
Without trusting the U.S., our country has no security security, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to make ourselves unilaterally unarmed first."
While Ri reiterated the familiar complaints of North Korea regarding Washington’s resistance to a ‘phasing-in’ approach to making North Korea free of nuclear power, on the basis of which, when he took step-by-step steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject the unilateral abolition of nuclear power, as Pjongjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump at the first US President-North Korean leader summit in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to move towards the “wait colonization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has wanted to end the 1950-53 Korean war officially, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been opposed to calls to loosen the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
The U.S. calls for “the first withdrawal of nuclear weapons” and increases the pressure on restrictions in order to achieve their goal in a forced manner, even against the statement of end of war,” said Ri.
The notion that restrictions push us on our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continuing restrictions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit of Kimi and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted the meeting between three Kimi and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If one of the parties to nuclearization was South Korea, not the USA, the topic of nuclearization in Korea would not have reached such a dead end.”
However, Ri's speech was sharply different from that of the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that turning to the US continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Mr. Paha President Trump appointed Kim as a "missile man" on his suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened to completely destroy North Korea in the UN, praised Kim’s courage to take steps towards becoming unarmed, but added that there is still much to be done and that the restrictions must remain in place until the North Korean nuclear force was lifted.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no schedule for this, saying: “Does it take two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should award for the measures taken by Pjongjang.
At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “The enforcement of Security Council restrictions must continue strongly and without failure until we can fully and definitively confirm the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea, seeking to prevent the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.
Pompeo met alongside the United Nations General Assembly in Riga and later said he would again visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been visiting North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
Following a meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said he had progressed, after which he only condemned North Korea after a few hours of “gangsterlike demands”.
At this month’s meeting with Moon, North Korea allowed rockets and nuclear complex to be demolished if the United States would implement ‘measures’.
He said that Kim had said to him that under the ‘measures’, he was referring to Trump’s security guarantees in Singapore and to the normalisation of Washington’s relationship.
Harvard students learn how to rest enough
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to fight a growing aggressive culture where they learn through caffeine-rich overnight learning marathons.
Students who love the academicism of the world’s best university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
According to Charles Czeisler, an expert at Harvard Medical School sleep doctor, Brigham and Women's Hospital, this course is the first of its kind in the United States.
He inspired the creation of the course after he kept a speech on how sleep disorders affect learning.
At the end, a girl came to me and asked: “Why is it only now, my last school year is told?”
He said that no one had ever told him the importance of sleep - it created my puffiness,” he explained to Telegraph.
The course, which first came into the curriculum this year, explains how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and Chief Health Officer of the University, said that the university decided to take the course curriculum after it was found that the students were in serious sleep shortages during the working week.
The lesson course covers a number of interactions.
In one section, students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books, explaining the effects of caffeine and light on how a lack of sleep affects sports outcomes and the importance of going to bed.
The second part explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus, along with its counteract symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily practices.
We know that this does not change the behavior of students immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effect of smoking cigarettes on health,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, night-time learning marathons are still proud, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that lack of sleep is still a growing problem.
Ensuring a sufficient quality sleep time should be the student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he added.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler to create a course in one of his classes in his first year of Harvard.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all degree students to complete a similar study program before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for both going to bed and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” caused by electronic screens and LED lighting, because it can damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gate defeated Gerrardi's men
The Rangers suffered from another poor guest game, when Dolly Menga's blow, sent from side to Steven Gerrard, brought 1-0 winnings to Livingston.
The Ibrox side hoped to get its first guest win since February, when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a leader, with eight points falling behind the leadership of Ladbrokes Premiere Hearts.
Menga created his own gate seven minutes before half-time, and Rangers’ poor readiness could never recover from it.
Rangers thus fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place, remaining on Hibernian with just one goal.
For Rangers, problems may not be finished yet, because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound treatment after he could hit with an apparently discarded object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side leading along Ayrist and Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, however, went on with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been satisfied with how his well-trained boys choked their opponents at every step.
Rangers might have been more dominant, but Livingston made much more with his ball.
They would have had to hit the gate as early as the second opening minute when the first change of Menga sent Scott Pittman through the gate of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder did not take advantage of his opportunity.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs free shot was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but its defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a post in the back of the wide-arch blow.
The Rangers did gain control, but they seemed to have more hope than to believe in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have received a penalty kick if he collided with Steven Lawless at the 15th game minute, judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy Columbian player’s complaint.
Rangers managed to hit the target in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn’t worry about Lassana Coulibaly or the Ovie Ejaria event.
Although Livi’s 34th minute kick-out could ruin the game rules, no one can deny that they deserved it purely because of their performance.
Again, Rangers could not control Jacob's deep heavy performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher created the ball for Scott Robinson, who retained peace and chose Menga, who just took the plan to the end.
Gerrard acted in the intermission by exchanging Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, which almost paid off when the winger split the Morelos, but the impressive Kelly basted from his place to stop.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the type of game that suits them, where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
Holt's side could have promoted its leadership at the final stage, but McGregor stood firm by preventing Jacobs before the Lithgow created a large-arced corner.
His alternate, Glenn Middleton, again sought a penalty kick when he went up with Jacob, which Thomson did not satisfy again.
Almanah: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our Sunday Morningu Almanah: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and LOUNTING... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From this foundation of science, Geiger's counter also became the foundation of pop culture as in the 1950's "Coronado Watches", where in the starring episodes these seemingly unlikely cowboys scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were:
Man: “What else is this thing?”
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these earbuds, it is possible to hear the pod of atoms separated from the radioactivity of minerals.”
Evans: “Do not tell you, but it is now just shining!”
Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his name-bearing invention lives on.
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to “see” fraudster cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” fraudster cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to feel as part of the treatment of rogue cells
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then they can “see” common protein for many cancers and they are reinjected back
The study vaccine shows promising results for patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to detect fraudster cells disappeared her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient, these cells are changed in the laboratory so that they can “see” protein, which is common in various HER2 cancers, and then these cells are reinjected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘directs the growth of many types of cancer’, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach where patients are taken into immune cells and they are taught to target cancer cells has been used in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West started with a supportive tribe of Trump, wearing the MAGA hat in the SNL live show.
It didn't go very well
In the Saturday Night Live studio, you’ll get a derogatory whistleblower towards Kanye West, after his disgusted speech, in which he praised President Donald Trump and announced his application for the same position in 2020.
After that evening, after his third song, called Ghost Town, where he wore a hat with Make America Great, he began to play against the demons and reiterated his support to Trump.
I have spoken so much to the white men who ask me, “How can Trump please you, he is from the race?”
If I were so concerned about racism, I would have moved away from America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood fame joked about Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Committee of Judges regarding Christine Blasey Ford’s alleged sexual violence.
Although this part of the broadcast didn't live, West's noisy footage was loaded into the comic Chris Rock social media.
It has remained unclear whether Rock tried to mock with the West post.
West also complained to the audience that he was quite difficult with his hat behind the scenes.
They fooled me behind the stage.
They said that I would not go there, a hat on his head.
They fooled me!
And then they say that I have drowned in a place,” he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a sunken place? I put on my Superman’s cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love.”
His comments sparked the visitors’ resentment at least twice and seemed embarrassed by the SNL team. According to Variety, one person published: “The entire studio remained deadly.”
West was brought to the show at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande, because the singer's former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West amazed many with the song "I Love it", which at the time of submission he looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one courageous soul: THANK YOU TO GOD TO THE FAMILY MASS.”
But the presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just “the one he is, and it is absolutely wonderful.”
But I decided NOT to award (buying my music or clothing or supporting his “art”) anyone who, in my opinion, believes and disseminates a harmful worldview to my community.
He is free.
Like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now “the former Kanye West.”
He is not the first singer to change his performing name, following Diddyi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Also the rapper Snoop Dogg is called Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly departed music legend Prince, who made his name a symbol.

The celebrity of the game of thrones Kit Harington does not approve a pin of masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-blowing role in Jon Snowina HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actress (31) unloads an aggressive heroine stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young guys often feel that they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that “something has gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of masculinity in a pinstone in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently got married to the co-feminist Rose Leslie of his Game of Thrones (31), admitted that he felt “a lot of strong” that this problem needs attention.
I feel quite strong at the moment that we have gone wrong with manhood,” he said.
What have we taught men when they grow up in connection with the problem we now see?”
Kit believes that the rise of masculinity in the field is partly at fault with television, because it shows supermanic characters.
He continued: “What is congenital and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they need to be exactly the ones they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
Because obviously something has gone wrong for young people.”
In the poll, he also admitted that after the end of the series in the next summer, he never participates in any sequel to the game of Thrones, saying that he is “one side with his battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit Sam is participating in the rehabilitation of Shepard True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his robbery brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose as the best thing related to the game of Thrones.
I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” she said.
Rose played in the award-winning fantasy series Yggdrasil, the character of Kit, Jon Snow loved.
The couple married in a family home in Leslie's family home in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/aids: China reports 14% growth in new cases
China has reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and aids has skyrocketed to 14%.
According to healthcare professionals, more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
Around 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have arisen from sex, making it a thing of the past.
Natively, HIV spread to some parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had decreased to almost zero, Chinese healthcare officials confirmed the conference in Yunnan Province.
Year on year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is said to be high.
Due to the old-minded values of the country, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men finally marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are related to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to use general access to HIV drugs to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of the employee's GOP senator's data, saying that it is a "dangerous lies" and "swear theories"
On Saturday, US representative Maxine Waters condemned the claims that his employee had posted three republican Senators’ personal data on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are distributed by “ultra-right” trolls and their websites.
False, false, and even more despicable lies,” Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The published information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both of Utah).
Information appeared on the Internet Thursday, which was posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate panel in connection with the allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-minded websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the post was linked to the office of Waters and issued member information of an employee under Waters, Hill reported.
This unfounded claim is complete and absolute wrong,” continues Waters.
My employees, whose personality, personal data and safety have been compromised because of their fraudulent and false claims, are in no way responsible for this disclosure.
This unfounded plea is complete and irrefutable wrong.’
The Waters application was quickly reviewed on the Internet, including one of the reviewers of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This denial comes from anger," wrote Fleischer.
It suggests that it has a feeling that is not appropriate for a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of anything they have not done, they must not become angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the offender’s motives.
They must remain calm.”
Fleischer appeared to be a comparative critic of the reactions of Waters against Judge Kavanugh, whom the critics accused of being too angry at the time of Thursday’s hearing.
The Republican candidate, Omar Navarro, who applies for the place of Waters in interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
Important when it comes to truth,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned ‘the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities in relation to their fraudulent allegations’.
We will do everything to find out the criminals,” he continued, “and that they should legally be responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all my employees.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - Underarmed Rowan Atkinson Spy Parody
It is common practice to look for the meanings of Brexit in all new British films, and it seems to be particularly appropriate in Johnny's English action parody series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and got a sequel to Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is it humorous to have fun about how stupid we are in the new export opportunity of the country?
In any case, blush-eyed, incompetent Johnny English has been given permission to do things once again in his awkward way - and that this wide comical creation is meant for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it is a secret agent who, despite his strange claim to smoothie glamour, resembles a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean, and a little character who gave the character of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also based on the character's traveler and international mysterious Atkinson, who once was played in forgotten Barclaycard television ads, who leaves only chaos.
There are only one or two pleasant moments in this latest JE film.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter when he wore a medieval armor and the helicopter's impellers for a moment he would call against the helmet.
The donated by Atkinson is shown to make a physical comedy, but humor seems less important and strangely superfluous, especially when “serious” spy movies such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer their own self-confident comedy.
It seems that this humor is more intended for children than adults, and for me Johnny English's cunning adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent films Beanina.
Currently, there is forever a current assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker has invaded the UK’s top-secret spy web network, revealing the personalities of all British secret police officers, thus preparing a huge disappointment to the on-site agent – regretably a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister who is a solemn and struggling character who suffers from the burden of political dispopularity: Emma Thompson does it perfectly with the character of Teresa-May, but there is not much in the manuscript to work on.
His intelligence advisors recommend that, since all active spying is compromised, they must recall someone who has retired.
And that is Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in one of the proud institutions, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of good places where English School of Rock Spy School offers.
English will fly back to Whitehall for emergency notification and reconnect with his former long-time pair Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where actress Vicki Pepperdine's talents are seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, her Majesty's secret service stigmas are back in action, in places with Olga Kurõlenko embodied beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the paw of a charismatic tech billionaire, claiming that he can solve all the computer problems of the British: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their daring odyssey: by hiding themselves as waitresses, they run out of fire to the French restaurant; they create chaos, secretly hillside the Volta luxury yacht on board; and English launches a real orderly frequency when he tries to use the virtual reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as cute and as hot as it is, the whole thing is the taste of the children's TV.
Quite mediocre stuff.
And, as with other Johnny English movies, I felt mindful: is the British film industry really not to give Rowan Atkinson the role that would be fair to his talent?
The Labour Party denies the preparation of a plan, where the British work for four days a week, but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Party of Labour has considered a pivotal plan that stipulates that the British work four days a week, but they are paid for five days.
The Party wants the company's bosses to transmit the savings received through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the employees, giving them one additional day off.
That way, employees would have a three-day weekend - but they would get the same salary.
According to the source, this idea would suit the economic agenda of the party and so the state would like to tilt in favour of employees.
The Thursday working week has been approved at the Trade Union Congress, so that employees can take advantage of the changing economy.
The source of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “It is presumed that the review of the draft will be announced before the end of the year.
It does not take place overnight, but the Thursday working week is an aspiration that is compatible with the party’s approach to balance the economy in favour of both employees and the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The work party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a Thursday weekday during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Spokesperson of the Labour Party said: “Thursday work week is not a party policy and the party does not discuss it.”
Undersecretary John McDonnell used the Conference of the Labour Party last week to clarify his vision of a social revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take back the power of utility companies from “unfaced managers” and “profit-makers”.
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not receive all their participation, as the Labour Party could make “deductions” in connection with a perceived misdemeanour.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in the management boards of the company and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10% of the private sector’s equity employees instead of giving annual bonuses up to €561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in the show "60 Minutes" whether exploring FBI Kavanaught can change their minds
The investigation of charges brought by the FBI against the judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the application to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the conclusions of the office could affect the termination of support for senators from the Republicans.
In a Sunday survey, you’ll be asked by Scott Pelley’s co-host from the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than her colleague from South Carolina.
Naturally,” said Kennedy.
I said I am going to be heard, and I said I have spoken to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked him, “Do you do it?”
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.”
Graham's voice seems to be rockproof.
I am certain in my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and can only change it in the bomb,” he said.
Dr. Ford, I don’t know how this happened, but I know that Brett denied it vigorously,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all he has appointed could not confirm this.
This is a 36-year-old thing.
I can’t see anything new coming.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the New York Global Citizen Festival hosts an annual music event with a huge amount of impressive celebrity participation and the same impressive goal: to lose poverty from the world.
Now, the 7th-time Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park’s Great Lawn area not only enjoyed singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the global poverty project Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers who hope to end poverty, constantly increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To receive a free VIP ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for the VIP ticket), concert guests had to perform several tasks or volunteer activities, send an e-mail to some world leaders, call or do something else important to help raise awareness about their goal of poverty loss.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been if there is another 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to take action or is it just another click-through where people feel they are doing something important by signing a statement online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters in an effort to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders inform more than $37 billion of obligations and policies that affect more than 2.25 billion lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 obligations and notices arising from their activities, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid out or funded.
The Group is still directly assessing the impact of secured funds on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the UK-based investor and implementer partnership The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “help children take advantage of all their abilities”, promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help stop malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens such as you, we can transform malnutrition into a historical footnote to social injustice,” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the crowd during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5000 activities calling for improvement in mother and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced the funding project The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to one FAQ on your website asking you, “which makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult path - sometimes we fall and fail.
But as we have great civil rights and anti-archeid movements, we are confident in our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a few performers who will perform at this year’s event in New York, headed by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the naval "blank" to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
According to Washington Examiner, Washington may, if necessary, use its navy to prevent the capture of the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, has published the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s participation in Syria, especially when it functions as a legitimate government call, is a pretext for researching new energy markets.
I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, on the rude of Southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
The United States of America has this opportunity, through our navy, to ensure that the shipping lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he added.
Zinke’s statement was addressed to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, which is a non-profit organization that represents the ‘power consumer voice’ in the United States.
He went to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they were essentially the same.
The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less, boosting and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when Trump's government is tasked with increasing the exports of LNG to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump’s officials, including President Donald Trump himself, seek to persuade Germany to eject the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a “prison” in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that a $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce response to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” said the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak at a meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has received a setback from Germany who has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Association of Industry (BDI) called for the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I face a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Association (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren seriously considers applying for president in 2020 says Massachusetts Senator
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she was seriously considering applying for the presidential election in mid-term elections.
At Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts Warren confirmed his consideration for the application.
It’s time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, and it also includes the first lady,” she said.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider applying for a president."
Warren also assessed President Donald Trump’s actions at the Town Hall, saying he “will take the country in the wrong direction.”
I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” he said.
Warren has published criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren tweeted on Friday: “Of course, we need an investigation into the FBI before voting.”
However, a Thursday poll showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not think he should apply in 2020.
According to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of the "probable" Massachusetts voters thought that the senator should not apply.
32% supported such application.
The survey showed more support for the candidature of the former Governor, 38% supported a possible application and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 application include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he would formally decide for January, announced Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin PTSD when gathering Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq to recruit from September.
He was arrested on Monday evening in connection with the case of domestic violence and accused of
What my son lives through when he comes back, I can associate myself with other families who feel the consequences and wounds of PTSD that our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience at the gathering of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oktahama.
Palin called his son's arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, in connection with his son and other war veterans, that "they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back to thinking of whether there is enough respect for what soldiers and pilots and all other military personnel have given to the state."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, Dan Bennett, said he was accused of domestic violence against the women, the report on domestic violence, and the possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication.
18 states and the Columbia region challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new US policy that bans asylum victims fleeing from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and regions submitted a brief statement of court friends in Washington on Friday to support the provocative policy related to the asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The complete name of the applicant, Grace v Sessions, proposed by the American Association of Civil Liberties in August against the Union’s policy, has not been published.
The wife said that her fellow “and her violent sons of the gang” abused her, but the U.S. officials did not accept her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was detained in Texas.
The National Lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as a large number of US asylum seekers, among whom the gangs and domestic violence are a major concern.
The new US asylum policy reversed the 2014 Resolution of the Board of Appeal of Immigrants, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Chief Prosecutor of the Columbia region, said in a Friday statement that the new policy “does not respect national, Union and international law for decades”.
The Federal Law requires that all applications for asylum be settled in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such a requirement infringes this principle,” said the court friends’ brief statement.
In a short statement, lawyers also argued that the refusal of immigrants to enter the US economy, saying that they would likely become entrepreneurs and ‘provide the necessary workforce’.
The Prosecutor-General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence against wealth in June.
The application for asylum is available to those who leave the country due to persecution or fear in relation to a race, religion, nationality or a certain social group or political opinion,” said Sessions in his Communication of 11 June.
The purpose of the shelter was never to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - with which people face every day.
Entertaining rescue operations Requested, where deaths have doubled in the fight against survivors
The situation for the survivors was increasingly threatening.
The situation is very tight,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who comforted her fever at the spawning Palu town evacuation centre.
Every minute new people arrive with an ambulance.
Clean water is not enough.”
Residents returned to their destroyed homes by sorting through things and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that had been damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some injured, including a broken back and upper arm, Dwi Haris rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were still treated outdoors due to strong surges.
The tears filled his eyes when he recalled how the strong earthquake shook his fifth floor hotel, which he shared with his husband and daughter.
There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed against the wall in the ruins,” Haris Associated told the Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming, but then there was silence.
I do not know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are not in danger.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of bullying with “straight work ads”
A week after China's official newspaper published four pages of the U.S. daily news about the mutual daily benefits of U.S. Chinese trade, the U.S. Ambassador charged Beijing with the use of American press to distribute propaganda.
President Donald Trump referred to the annex paid by China Daily last Wednesday in Des Moines Register, Iowa’s largest print magazine, after China was accused of the United States Congress elections of 6 November, which China denies.
Trump accused Beijing of attempting to intervene in U.S. elections, celebrating what US officials described to Reuters as a new stage in the expanding Washington campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to do advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where the import tariffs of each other are adjusted.
China's countermeasures at the start of the tariff war were intended to capture the exporters of states such as Iowa, as they supported the parties of the Republics of Trump, Chinese and US experts have explained.
U.S. Ambassador China and former Governor of Iowa, as well as China’s largest exporter of agricultural products Terry Branstad, said Beijing damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in Des Moines Register’s Opinion article on Sunday: “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing campaign ads in our free press.”
In its propaganda distribution, the Chinese government uses American expensive freedom of expression and free press practice, placing its paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
On the other hand, there are only limited voices in Beijing’s street kiosk and do not really see the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say what newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that the Republicans will transfer female voters before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many republicans await and defend the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, accused of numerous sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a setback during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in the ceiling, and most republicans have already shown that they want to go forward with voting.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School, belonging to the University of Syracuse, in his Saturday article The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s attempt to study the FBI is enough to calm the angry voters.
Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they don’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Mr. MoveOn, Senior Adviser to the Progressive Group on Friday, and Mr. Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC, the national representative.
On Friday morning, protesters reiterated “November is coming!” at the demonstration in their Senate corridor, because the republicans who control the committees of judges decided to proceed with the Kavanaugh candidacy despite Dr Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
The democratic ind and inland intervention will be beyond the chart,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unofficial political analyst at the news site.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But this can be higher, especially among female electors on the outskirts and younger voters aged between 18 and 29 who do not like the President and often fail to vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which described his allegations of sexual attack against the Supreme Court candidate, the analysts predicted a setback when the republicans proceeded with the confirmation.
This has become very confusing for GOP,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Committee of Republicans, according to NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
This does not only concern the vote of the Commission, the final vote, nor whether the intention will be put into office by Kavanaught, it also concerns how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it,” Mr. Guy Cecil, head of the United States (a group that helps to select democracies) drew attention to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided, who believe in Ford after the testimonies and who Kavanaugh, but slightly more supporting the first.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they certainly or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they think that Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his certificate, while only 30% thought about the same Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accusation to Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford admitted last week before the Senate Committee of Judges under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed him his genitals when they participated in one party during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet that will push the breast with Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee launched a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Solid open-source platform for the Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to information.
In exceptional questioning for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal is “the rule of the world”.
We have to do it now," he said about the start-up.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online database” or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and competent tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all available in one browser and simultaneously.
This personal online database makes it unique that the user can choose who can access this information.
The Company calls it “to provide personal authority through data”.
According to John Bruce, the head of the company, Inrupt's idea is to provide sources, process and relevant skills to help Solid make available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work in the project under a contract, and a community of voluntary encoders.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own proprietary applications using the resources available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google, whether to introduce a complete change if all their business models are fully supported overnight.
We do not ask for their permission.
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet by establishing a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the discussion of network impartiality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: a memorial stone of clergy crucified in World War I
As the only church that got the cross during World War I, Victoria's English church celebrated its 100th anniversary in its home town.
The Colonel Lieutenant Reverend Bernard Vann fought out his honour on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellengli and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by the sniper's bullet, and did not know that he had received the highest British military award.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “geniously symbolic” if the stone was opened exactly 100 years after the award winning battle of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Lieutenant Bath headed his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentini “through a very thick mist and a ball rake for machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and moved it forward with the “bigst galance” before he rushed alone to a machine gun and struck the three opponents unattended.
Colonel Lieutenant Bath killed a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - when only a little more than a month was left until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never repeat, but for which I always be grateful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, placed a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood’s royal youth band.
Michael Vann said that he is “a great honour to participate in this parade” and added that “the presence and support of so many people show that a real hero can be appreciated.”

Imagine you’ve been up for the night to watch Bellator 206, but this main event will not show you.
The San Jose match included 13 fights, including six main cards, and was shown on the 5th channel of the UK live all night.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousi and Rory MacDonald prepared to breastfeed with each other, the UK viewers remained in their mouths long since Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many hadn’t fascinated about it, especially those who had been awake until early hours to see the fight.
A fan described the transition on Twitter to a children’s comic as “no hurt jokes”.
It is government regulation that at 6.00 the content was no longer suitable and they had to switch to the children’s program,” explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator on marketing and communication issues when asked about the transfer.
Nettle Peppa, yes.
The President of the Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they intend to work on their schedule to consider more with UK viewers in the future.
When I’m now thinking about playback, I think we can solve this problem in the future,” said Coker.
But if there is 6 Sunday morning there, we can not do it before our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of re- and back text, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it was not, it was a government rule.
I can promise you that this will not happen the next time.
We show a reference instead of six fights - as we usually do - we tried to offer more to fans, and we just went over in time.
This is a situation like a star."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “undervalued” in relation to sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic winner diver, says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation for success.
The 24-year-old young man said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everyone is not like him".
Participating in Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 by sending Desert Island Discs, he said he talks about homosexuality to give hope to others.
Even becoming a parent, he changed his attitude towards winning the Olympic Games, giving the feeling that it is no longer so important.
You can get a regular long-term presenter Kirsty Young who had to get free for a couple of months due to his illness.
In Laverne’s first show, Daley said she felt less valuable when growing up than others because you weren’t socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Unto this day, these feelings are that I am not worthy and feel different, gave me power and strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was “worthy” and did not disappoint others when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Bronze Olympic winner has become the leader of the highly acclaimed LGBT campaign, using his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to turn to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he talks about it because he is lucky that he can live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - the American film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "hit him as a surprise."
Last year, Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner, but he said that the difference between age has never been a problem.
If you are so young, he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it was difficult to find someone as old who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his “all prospect” has changed.
If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
But you know, there are many more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son got his name after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after diagnosing the brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not agree to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit at the forefront.
I could not say to him that “Father, you can’t sit in the front line because by that time you will no longer be.”
I kept her hand when she stopped breathing, and only after she had actually finished breathing and died, I finally admitted that she was not invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of for a lifetime - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there is no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Heather Small Proud - which helped her to prepare the Olympic Games and still creates her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of form Mickelson was removed from the game on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to improve his form to avoid an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time every two years at the event, was removed from the game by captain Jim Furyk for a Saturday pair game and four-ball.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has often been for the US, the five-time winner split his day into two, being an invigor and working on his game, in the hope of improving it.
Never the most direct striker, not even at the peak of your career, is not especially suitable to play at the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where the long rough track constantly punishes misguided blows.
And when the square itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molina, who has joined forces with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four races this week.
If the Americans, who are behind four points at the beginning of 12 single games, start firingly, the Mickelson competition may be extremely important.
Furyk expressed trust in his man, but he did not have much more to add.
He fully understood his current part, patted me on his shoulder, laid his hand around my shoulder and said that he was ready for tomorrow,” added Furyk.
He is very confident.
She is a celebrity and she has given so many of our teams in the past as well as this week.
I probably didn’t foresee him playing two games.
I saw more, but went so and we had to choose such a path.
She wants to be out, like everyone else.”
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo’s record on Sunday as the most player participating in Ryder Cup games.
This can mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never met his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven draws, but Furyk said that his presence had made an additional spiritual contribution to the team.
She is funny, lavish, witty, likes to have fun with people, and she is just great in the team room,” she explains.
I think younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week and it was nice to see it.
He offers much more than just a game.”
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great head start can soon disappear
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that Ryder Cup's big lead in the last day at the beginning of individual games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
At the 1997 contest in Valderrama, Denmark, with Captain Seven Ballesteros, five-point advancements were held in front of the Americans, but it had drastically fallen over the finish line, the victory was only achieved with the result of 141⁄2: 131⁄2.
You’ll even remember that we had a big leadership position in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and won in Valderrama,” said Bjorn after winning Class of 2018 at 5:3 Friday and yesterday with 10:6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it may happen again.
Going tomorrow to give your best.
You go out and do the right things.
This is not complete until you have the points listed.
We have a goal to win the cup and thus focus on it.
All the time I have said, I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with how his players have played at this heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush in front of things.
Tomorrow it is a whole new obstacle.
Tomorrow, personal performance counts and that is why it’s more.
It is nice to be with the opposing player if things go well, but if you are in person there, you will be tested as a golfer in full.
This is the message you need to convey to players – give tomorrow your best.
Now that you leave your partner behind, you also have to go and do it yourself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will act better personally than the opposing players except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three from four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both over these last days, being part of the Brookline winning team before becoming a part of the loss, when Europe defeated the “Medinah Miracle”.
I remember each of these words,” he said in response to the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all their games on the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you need to start firingly, like in Brookline and like in Medina.
If the momentum goes in one direction, it puts great pressure on the average races.
We set up our team accordingly and put the guys on the field in a way where we feel that it will be a miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the competition and he is the best against Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter as the other best Europeans in the competition.
I put my boys in such a queue because I think we are properly covered,” said Bjorn in his selection of individual games.
Germany's new warship refused again
The latest fast sailboat from the German Navy should have been introduced in 2014, replacing the warships during the old Cold War, but this does not happen before next year due to faulty systems and the costs of snowballing, the local media reported.
The introduction of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg high-speed sailing yacht “Rheinland-Pfalz” has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 in accordance with the military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy already in 2014, but the post-delivery problems would not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
The four classes of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ship, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, are replaced by old-timers of the class of Bremen.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-airplane and anti-shipping missiles, and some concealing technologies such as reducing radars, infrared and audible signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest fast sailboats should be able to be shipped out of the home port for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships - which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad - will become obsolete at the time of their service.
The failed F125 high-speed sailboat appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to deploy the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
It was the first time that the navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after it was received.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media quoted a number of significant "software and hardware deficiencies" that made the warship unusable if they had been used on a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important, as the ships in the Baden-Württemberg class are managed by a team of approximately 120 sailors - only half of the high-speed sailors in the older Bremen class.
It also turned out that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the navy's ability to incorporate future innovations.
The “Rheinland-Pfalz” weighing 7000 tons is probably twice as difficult as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project will also become a problem, including the training of the team.
It has been said that it amounts to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems associated with newer high-speed sailboats become particularly important in the light of recent warnings, according to which the power of the German navy will decrease.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the navy had actually run out of ‘eligible ships’.
The official said that this theme has grown over time as a snowball, because the old ships were removed, but there were no substitute ships.
He regretted that none of the high-speed sailboats in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the navy.
National Trust explores the secret life of bats
The aim of the new study in the Scottish Highlands is to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for their food.
It is hoped that the results will provide a new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future protective measures.
Research by researchers at the National Trust in Scotland follows traditional and soprano pins in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Rossi, as well as the brown long-leaved and Daubenton bat.
Special recorders are placed in the main places of the area to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also perform field research using hand-held sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings determines the frequency and types of crayons.
Then a map of habitats and a report will be created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by different species.
This information helps to determine the usefulness of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, the bat population has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affects their habitat and its loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as are papers flying and chemical processing of some building materials, as well as attacks by pets cats.
In fact, bats are not dark.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching catch than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections, and sometimes save.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only special bat in the area of Threave in Dumfrie and Galloways, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat types live.
Real estate manager David Thompson says that this area is the perfect territory for them.
At Threave, we have a large area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great habitat.
But there is still a lot to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas helps us better understand what they need.”
He emphasizes the importance of controlling bats before starting a real estate maintenance activity, as the unwanted destruction of a place of pregnancy and childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, disturbing or destroying them is unlawful.
The Scottish officer of the League for the Protection of Bats Elisabeth Ferrell has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape accusations while lawyers plan to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected rape accusations against him as a “counterfeit” saying that people “want to advertise” using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been invaded by the American woman Kathryn Mayor to rape in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He has reportedly paid 330 643.10 euros to the women so that he would not talk about the incident, Der Spiegel announced on Friday.
Turning to his 142 million followers in direct Instagram video after accusations, Ronaldo (33) was reported as “counterfeit news”.
No, no, no, no.
The fake news is what we’ve talked about today,” said Ballon d’Or’s five-time winner for news.
They want to promote themselves with my name.
This is common.
They want to become famous using my name, but this is part of the work.
I am a lucky man and everything in order,” added a player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s attorneys are preparing to appeal to Der Spiegel’s court in connection with the “not permissible suspicion of privacy”.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player is claiming compensation for “moral damage that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most severe personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged case occurred in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor were reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where they were reportedly raped in accordance with documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
With Mayor, it claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after an alleged incident and told him that he was a ‘99 percent good man’, of whom ‘one percent moves down’.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple's sexual relationship, but it was not unanimous.
Mayor also argues that he went to the police and took photos of injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court solution, because he feared “revengeance” and was concerned about “public humiliation”.
Now the 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to refute the solution, as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo had left Manchester United and joined Real Madrid and this summer he moved to Italy in connection with a transaction of 100 million euros for the giant Juve.
Brexit: The UK can start to regret leaving car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom would “repeat it forever” if it lost its position as world automotive leader after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that the Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain had left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop their production plant near Derby in Burnaston.
We need an agreement,” said Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of border crossing downtime without Brexit agreement can pay jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where vehicles are manufactured in Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My opinion is that if the UK starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop in production at its factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also been afraid of leaving the EU without agreement, worrying about the operation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it closes the Mini factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
The Toyota Production Line works as needed, with spare parts coming from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement signed on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border that, according to the industry, may cause delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day stock in its Derbyshire factory, so production must be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers’s plan for future EU relations is “precisely calibrated to avoid such controls at the border.”
We want the best solution that allows us to make the most of what we want and not just take advantage of the current success, but the whole opportunity,” he said to BBC Radio 4 broadcast Today.
Evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers shows that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota couldn’t say how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, warned that additional costs would reduce factory competitiveness and ultimately also cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, 24 years working at Burnaston, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know that if jobs disappear, they will not come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan on our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House
Meeting Donald Trump’s big stakes with Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week, as the fight against the highest-ranked candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Commissioner Robert Mueller, who investigates interventions in Russian elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and the possible impediment to justice by the President.
Will Trump unleash the Deputy Prosecutor General and thereby threaten the independence of Mueller, have sparked Washington’s rumors for several months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of interception tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to remove President through a 25th change.
Rosenstein did not confirm this.
But last Monday he went to the White House, declaring that he was going to step back.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting with Trump was announced, then in New York with the United Nations.
Trump said he did not want to trigger Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with the hearing of the Senate Panel of the Judges, where Kavanaught and one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, gave both testimonies.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation against Kanaugh, delaying the Senate's vote.
Trump's spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News news channel on Sunday.
If he was asked about a meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the matters relating to the Supreme Court.
But let’s look at it and keep up to date with the press, as always.”
Some journalists would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not due to the disappointment of TV journalists, although he added: “I do not dispute the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President performs more questions and answers sessions than any President before him,” he said, without adding any evidence, “We have looked at these numbers.”
Information sessions continue, confirmed by Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We try to do so a lot and you have seen how we have done it in the last few weeks, so that it will take place at the time of the press conference, if you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the President demonstrated why, having come together before the journalists stepping on a free movement and sometimes with a strange appearance.
Minister of Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland regarding Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written for EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland to express their appreciation and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter if less than six months remain until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the costs of the established status of EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, negotiations have continued on the UK-EU resignation, heading towards expected decisions in this autumn.
However, the UK government has also made preparations for a possible non-Agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That’s why I wanted to repeat how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie passed the emergency surgery after the head injury
The supporter of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, passed an extraordinary surgery after the injury and defeat of Saturday 31:27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, released by Tennessee Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, General Manager at Tennessee State, told journalists that the injury happened just before half time.
He fell on his side and simply collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombie while on their sides before he was placed on the carrier frame for further inspection from the field.
The official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie operation from Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that there are no details about the type / extent of the injury yet, and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student of the second year with a red shirt, was in Tennessee State in his first season after the transgression from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before he left the game, which made a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher stamp duty when purchasing real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help homeless on the basis of new Tory plans
This step will unfortunately make Corbyn a quest to attract young voters
Stamp tax is charged on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
Ministry of Finance hopes that it will create up to £120 million per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help homeless, Theresa May today announced.
It is considered an attempt to make the movement harmless Jeremy Corbyn’s quest to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable housing and target high-income people.
The stamp duty is levied on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, targeting the government’s desire to fight homelessness.
Surcharge - which is in addition to this stamp duty, including higher levels, which were introduced two years ago in another home and for resale-related purchases - can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will generate up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the property purchased in London is owned by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get down on their feet when they buy a home.
Many of the wealthy regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become “ghost cities” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time out of the country.
The new policy will arrive only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding real estate prices high when they buy land but don’t use it, and invited May to abandon the affordable home quotas to improve ‘household-related shame’ in the United Kingdom.
Corbyn has reported on the reform of an eye-catching housing economy, including rent control and ending the perplexing of innocent people.
He also wants to give councils more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year, I promised that as a prime minister, I was committed to restoring the British dream – that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own life here.
However, it is right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, are as easy to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland”
Jack Ross, Head of Sunderlan, says that his “final goal” is to become a Scottish leader at some point.
The Scottish (42) is delighted with the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club, currently ranked third in League One, with only 3 points behind it.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Champions League.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I reached the B class and it was limited,” said Ross BBC in Sportound for Scotland.
But I grew up with my father looking at Scotland in Hampden, and this is always something that has pulled me back.
However, this option comes only when I’m successful in club management.”
The predecessors of Rossi Sunderland have been Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel afraid of such big and well-known names, having previously resisted both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, it is currently a success if I can take this club to the Champions League.
Due to its structure and facilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Champions League,” he said.
Getting there is not an easy task, but I see myself successful only if I manage to take the club back there."
Ross has worked as a leader for only three years, being previously the Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among Hearts’ executive staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to the third level and making St Mirren the lowest position the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says that he now feels more comfortable when he was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical during his career.
It was a true crossroads,” he recalled the takeover of Alloa.
I really believed that management is more suitable for me than playing.
It seems strange because I managed, got a reasonable income and enjoyed some highlights.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things that need to be done weekly.
I still experience this with the tension and pressure of my work in mind, but the management just feels right.
I have always wanted to lead and now I do it. I feel more comfortable now than I have ever been in adulthood.”

According to the study, the best time for the surface on Saturday at 17.30
Summer heat has improved the turnover of British pubs in trouble, but greater pressure has arisen on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, representative of the business consulting company CGA, compiled these figures: “Continuing participation in the World Championships in sunshine and England meant that July was similar to June when the turnover of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants went even harder.
In June 1.8% of the decline in restaurant trading deteriorated further in July.
The drinks-based pubs and bars were the most successful and the restaurants that tend to like the poorest.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out drinking.
Between managed pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while the sales of food fell by three per cent.”
The leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results will continue with the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to selling outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains will continue to fight, although sales drop by 4.8 percent compared to the previous year is especially painful in addition to ongoing price pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time shows whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August provide some essential relief.”
The increase in the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of trade mark-related institutions.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s industry sales monitor in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes 47 activity group performance data with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and is a benchmark for an established industry.
One child five has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
The study concluded that one child of five, some of them 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A study conducted among 20 000 gymnasists found the growth of “fake Insta” pages
The news heightened fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a “matrix account” for parents to show
The study concluded that one child of five, some of them only 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts they hide from adults.
A study conducted among 20 000 gymnasists found a noticeable increase in the “fake Insta” accounts (reference to the image sharing page Instagram).
The news heightened the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty per cent of students said that they have both a parent-based account and a “matrix account” that was made acceptable to them.
One discoverer of the secret page of his 13-year-old daughter saw that a teenager invited others to rape themselves.
The "Digital Awareness UK" and Headmasters (HMC) organization, which unites private schools, found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and were recognized by the parties as having personal accounts.
Head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing to see that so many teenagers are tempted to create accounts online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes spokesman for athletes at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director at the annual board meeting of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland’s most praised athletics player, and chairman Ian Beattie described what was happening as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
Eilidhi is respected everywhere in Scotland, the UK and elsewhere in the communities of athletes, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will reap the benefits of inviting her management,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I want to be a spokesperson for athletes and hope that I can really contribute to Scotland’s sports and contribute to its development.”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now often shares his opinion at the BBC, was unable to walk after a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time indicates whether I will recover and if so, to what extent.
I’ve done a lot of work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and I’m already doing speed training!
Thank you for encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertisement that compares women to cows, divides the internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the internet with two hosts of advertising, where the nursing mother is compared to milking cows.
According to stories about the presentation of the world’s first silent carrying breast pump, the consumer-oriented technology company, Elvie, published a similar advertisement to the ironic music video to showcase the freedom that this new pump gives to the wanting mothers.
Four real mothers dance with hay at a table filled with cows and sing: “Yes, I will milk myself, but you will not see me in the tail” and “If you do not notice, these are not udders, they are my breasts.”
I repeat the verse: “Pump, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.”
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company has created mutual opinions on the Internet.
Viewed 77 000 times and viewers with thousands of comments, many of them say that it illuminates the tent behind the dairy industry.
The use of cows to promote this product was a very poor decision.
Just as we have to conceive and give birth to milk production, but the difference is that children are stolen from them by the days they read after birth,” wrote one.
Elvie breast pump doesn’t catch the eye of the breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentary said: “Intelligible traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use these children to promote the breast pump of the mothers who can keep them?"
Someone added: Totally unscrupulous advertising.”
Part of it is by advertising. One woman found it super fun.
I find that this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy something for myself if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but we take it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product,” wrote one.
The second commented: “It is a fun advertisement (often in its workplaces or chatters) for pumping and feeling like cows.
This advertisement does not praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they have all danced into bras with not eye-catching pumps.
The idea behind the campaign is said that many women pumping milk from the breast feel like a cow.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, there are no wires or pipes and does not stand out from the nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even walk outdoors while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and irritating introduction.
With the comparison of women’s expressions and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting the extraordinary feeling of freedom that the new pump creates in a familiar way.
This is not the first time that news has reflected Elvie’s pump.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children carrying the designer Marta Jakubowski’s product appeared.
Thousands of migrant children went quietly to camp on the Texas border
The number of arrested migrants has risen sharply, although the monthly border crossings have remained quite the same, partly because the harsh rhetoric and politics enforced by Trump’s administrator has made it difficult to establish children with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and they have been afraid of violating the possibility of their country’s continued existence, requiring the child’s right of custody.
The threat increased in June, when national authorities reported that potential sponsors and other adults belonging to the household could present fingerprints and data are shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, Senior Commissioner for Immigration and Customs Organisation, admitted last week to Congress that the agency arrested a dozen people who applied for financial support for non-participating minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no criminal past.
Almost 80 per cent of sponsors or sponsor household members staying in a country illegally and a large number of them have a criminal background.
So we will continue to follow them,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with the children more quickly, officials enforced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest; in the past, according to the workers of the shelter, in 60 days.
Many protect their legal content in front of the immigration judge by videoconference, coming to their seat.
Unsuitable for release is quickly sent out from the country.
According to the employees of the shelter and based on the system reports published in recent months - the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they will become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent demonstrations or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more topical in large detention facilities like Tornillo, where falling into the child's weight can be overlooked by size.
They added that moving children to a tent campus without leaving enough time to get used to the feeling or say goodbye to friends, can create a trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls for the immediate departure of the U.S., French, and Turkish occupation forces
The Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, although the state has been at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the external forces on the Syrian soil were illegally on the pretext of terrorist control and are dealt with accordingly.
They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he said in the assembly.
Moualem claimed that Syria's "anti-terrorism war is almost over", more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have left its homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred war until we cleansed the whole Syrian area” both from terrorist groups and from “any external force that is illegally present.”
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about war refugees, Moulem said that their return conditions are appropriate and he blamed some Western countries for the spread of the incomprehensible fears that prevent refugees from coming.
We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them to enjoy,” he said.
They are politicizing something that is just a humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted recovery aid until there is a war-end agreement between Assad and opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates the last insurgent support point in the Idlib buffer zone, has created a way to advance with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a wide uptake of Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province with three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the treaty had “explicit deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would strike the wars of the jihads, including the wars of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who were “destroyed”.
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convince new committees of government and opposition members with their first meetings to plan the post-war Syrian Constitution and pave the way for election.
Moualem made demands on the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned of the interference.
Why Trump is also elected for the second term
According to this logic, Trump could win in the next elections in 2020, when the dismissal and the scandal had not previously finished his presidency, as liberal viewers would probably want it.
What should undoubtedly be the most exciting end of the presidential office!
At the moment, the viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hourly ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during peak hours, and the number of visitors has increased as compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago. With the MSNBC, you can “The Rachel Maddow Show” through 3.5 million cable viewers have maintained its rating high during the main evening news.
This is a tension in which we are involved because we do not understand it,” said the Head of the ABC Drama Designed Survivor about the Secretary of Government, who will become President when the attack destroys the Parliamentary Building.
Nell Scovell, who is an experienced comedy writer and book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, the author, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston ahead of the 2016 elections.
The leader told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? asked him
He said he would make me laugh,” Ms. Scovell mentioned me.
All this chaos has an entertaining value.
Of course, not as the other TV shows, Washington’s rumors can become fatal to the future of Roe v. Wade and reunite with wanting immigrants to families and the global economy.
Avoiding the topic is only the luxury of the viewers in the prestige.
However, a six-hour talk show of experts who talk about Bob Woodward’s “In-depth background study” for their book “Fear” and Paul Manafort’s 13 225.73€ ostrich Bomber jacket (Washington Post said “excessive self-confidence in this regard” garment) and Stormy Daniels’s remarks with a miserable description of Trump’s anatomy, the viewer is more than an educated citizen.
For example, I never look at Super Mario with the same feeling again.
One of his activities, which may seem like a reality series, is that he shares something every night,” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of the series “Pandicles” with the shifting actors and daily plan of Brent Montgomery Trump’s performance (Strengthening the quarrel with the NFL, the praise of Kim Jong-uni).
You can’t miss any of the things, or else you’re down.
In this week’s places at Fless, his home was 80 degrees warm on the north shore of Kauai, but he had fled to the room to watch the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He could not give up watching Brett Kavanaugh copes with the Senate’s Legal Committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hangs at the ends of the hair.
I remember how in my time we made all kinds of crazy shows and people said that this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
I thought it was a kind of joke, but it would come out that they were right.”

For the rest, cash flows move to the coolest White house interim election
It is not perplexed that the 17th arrondissement of Pennsylvania will receive cash flow thanks to the restructuring of the congressional district, receiving two dominant undertakings on the same spot.
As a result, the number of the front town of Pittsburgh district from the Democratic Republic, Conor Lamb, who won a place in extraordinary elections in the second district last spring, was re-elected.
The opposite candidate for the lamp is the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the previous 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were changed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, so the old districts were divided into anti-constitutional electoral districts, favoring the Republicans.
The new 17th election has saved the campaign where the financial departments of the biggest political parties – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Campaign of the Republicans (NRCC) trump with money.
The lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in the extraordinary elections of the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania in March.
Many decades have happened to this place, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political opinion holders have given democrats a small advantage.
US El Salvador was punished for Chinese support, then withdrawn
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a small setback for Washington.
Mr. Trump met with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017, and had the Panama Hotel until the partners kicked out Trump’s company’s management team.
The officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the American leaders of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, as the spokesperson of the Ministry, Heather Nauert, said earlier this month that these countries recently did not support Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was planned to be punished, which received funding from America from $140 million in 2017, including for drug surveillance, development, and economic push.
The recommended penalties, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American state and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to organise a continuation of the similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a development in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials explained that they wanted to continue the meeting and end the debate on any El Salvador punishments.
According to diplomats, the Vice-President Mike Pence will now be reviewed, who will speak at the meeting in mid-October to talk about government positions.
And the three American envoys returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new severe announcements or punishments of Washington.
The spokesman for White House Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the three American talks, including the two diplomats who agreed to discuss the national debates at the request of anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the demand for anonymity.
Study history
Next, it may happen that Robert Mueller publishes a report on Trump’s possible administration of justice, for which there is a lot of evidence in the State Archives.
Mueller is also studying whether Trump’s campaign is related to Russia’s attack on our elections.
If the Congress should change the party, Trump must report to the institution as if he would again talk to voters and perhaps even his peer-to-peer judges.
There are many things here, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump or his European counterparts are inevitable.
We all sides of the Atlantic need to make a choice that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West would have prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and were deprived of the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of slaughter.
History goes around such stumps, and the merciless march of democracy will get closer or delayed.
Americans are now facing several turning points.
What do we do if Trump unleashes the prosecutor’s deputy director Rod Rosenstein, a man who checks the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that he proposed the secret recording of the President last year and speculated on his inappropriate position.
Rosenstein says that the Times’ statement is inaccurate.
How to react if the investigation of Brett Kavanaugh by the newly requested FBI is not complete or fair - or if, despite credible accusations in the Supreme Court, he or she is confirmed with regard to sexual attack and unfair evidence?
And above all, do we vote in the mid-elections of the Congress if Trump should be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy goes on a long winter holiday.
But I believe that we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once took over and used our ambassador’s home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me the light of the Sabbath candles on a table with a torch.
With such a legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers Graham Dorrans on Rapid Vienna battle pre optimistic
Rangers will arrange Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which followed an impressive draw previously received against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, will put them in a strong position to become a G Group of the European League.
The knee injury did not allow the mid-player Graham Dorrans to appear before the first 2:2 draw ending the game against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better results.
This was a good point for us, because Villarreal has a strong opponent,” said a 31-year-old player.
We went into the game, believing that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but in general it was a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game and again in our second half.
Thursday will be again one big and important European night.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a difficult game, because they got a good result in their last game, but since the nation supports us, I am sure that we can summarize ourselves and get a good result.
Last year was difficult, thanks to this, I was injured and changes took place within the club, but now we all have a good feeling of inside.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the workout is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, leave the previous season behind and be successful.”
Women cannot sleep due to fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few discussed it with their family members.
Around half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said it had spoken to their children.
People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they don’t speak about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Lifelong Activity at Nationwide.
However, it should be started.
Talk to your husband and children: You can't prepare your family if they don't know your wishes beforehand.
Collaborate with your advisor and your family, discussing where and how to get care, as these options can be extremely important in terms of costs.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan on how to pay for these costs.
Your funding options for long-term care can include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid financially valuable life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or proprietary self-insurance – as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already in the womb.
Contact your healthcare credentials to determine the trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that the specialists will follow at your request if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a trustee in relation to your financial fund.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget about the small details: imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and she is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer medication and allergy-related questions?
Write down these things to be ready if necessary.
This is not just a financial side, but it is also important who would be doctors?’ explained Martin.
What medicines are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put it all in place.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have perished as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reported officials adding that the number of deaths continues to increase.
Since the bond has been broken, rescuers have not received any information from the Donggala regents at the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawes, located on the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, and its population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was suddenly hit by earthquakes and tsunami.
Donggala regents is a region that extends over 300 km (180 miles) in the north-west of Sulawes Island.
Regents, which is the administrative area under the province, had an estimated 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawes, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
In the province, nickel mining is also important, which is mainly concentrated on the Morowal, the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, in the past 100 years, tsunami have hit Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people killed tsunami in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, the tsunami hit the west of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismicly located in the Pacific fire ring and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: The great earthquake on the west coast of the Province of Aceh in Indonesia, North Sumatra, on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-degree earthquake hit Indonesia from the south of the most populated Java island, creating a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The area near Padang, the capital city of western Sumatra, hit a 7.6-degree earthquake.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Sumatra - the island of Mentawai, unleashing a tsunami up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck Pidie Jaya in the Regent Aceh, sowing destruction and panic, reminiscent of the deadly earthquake of 2004 and the destruction brought by tsunami.
There was no Tsunami in this case, but more than 100 people died in collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Lombok, Indonesia's tourist island, killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in a goat.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, is arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in connection with suspicions of domestic violence, interference with the report related to domestic violence, and resistance to arrest.
According to the report of the police, when a female person tried to inform the police of alleged crimes, Palin took a phone from him.
Palini is held at the Mat-Su pre-trial investigation institution and is held against the $500 unsecured bail, reported by the KTUU.
He appeared on Saturday in the court where he declared that he was “not guilty in any case” announced the news network
Palin faces three class A misdemeanours, which means that he can be expected to have up to a year of imprisonment and a fine of $250 000.
He has also been accused of a B class misdemeanour that is punishable by a one-day imprisonment and a fine of $2000.
This is not the first time that a criminal prosecution has been brought to Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, police called over his mother Sarah Palin.
The case is currently being discussed by Alaskan veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of a domestic attack, of interference in the report of a domestic crime and of possession of a weapon, all in a drunken state.
His girlfriend claimed that the man created her in the face.
The groups of veterans criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 when he tied his son’s violent conduct to PTSD, which stems from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake was followed by tsunami: hundreds of deaths have died
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that hit the island of Indonesia Sulawes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks will not work and an increase in the number of people killed will be expected in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the outskirts of Sulawes city centre, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.
Videos on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
During the capture of Tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered for the festival on the beach of Palu.
In NYC, federal prosecutors apply for a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks
The federal prosecutors in New York apply for the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people were killed, and this rare penalty has not been enforced for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used the Home Depot rental car to attack the cycle path along the West Side highways in Lower Manhattan, cutting both pedestrians and cyclists on its way in October.
According to the notice of request for capital punishment submitted in the southern part of New York, prosecutors must prove in support of the death penalty that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and also caused serious bodily harms intentionally.
In both cases, court documents serve as a potential death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury charged Saipov with a 22-point charge, including eight murder charges with extortion commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised criminal crimes, and accused of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack presupposeed a "intensive planning and intent", the prosecutors said, describing the activity of Saipov "despite, cruel and depravous."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harms and losses to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco family and friends,” stands in the statement of intent.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last death proceedings of the District Court in the south of New York.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murder of two drug traders, but as a result, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when the couple was executed in a conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native believer, showed that there was no regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he had told the researchers that he was delighted with what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he inspired him to commit an attack on the ISIS videos watched from his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted to display the flag of ISIS in his hospital ward.
In a 22-point accusation, he has not accepted the accusation.
David Patton, one of the protectors of Saipov, said that they were ‘obviously disappointed’ in the procedural decision.
In our opinion, the decision to apply for capital punishment extends the trauma of all concerned people instead of the prison sentence of life without the possibility of exoneration,” said Patton.
Previously, the Saipov defence team asked prosecutors not to seek capital punishment.
According to a member of Tory, NIGEL FARAGE should be set to lead Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize a People’s Army” during the protest of today’s Tory Conference.
The former leader of the UKIP said that politicians had to “get to know the heat” of Euroseptics, as one of the members of Theresa May’s own parliament recommended to lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a common member of the Conservative Sub-chamber, said on the march in Birmingham that the UK “is now out” if Mr Farage was a Brexit secretary.
However, Mrs. May faces a problem in her deep-cracked reconciliation of lines underlined by the conservatives that advocated staying in the city by joining its own protest against Brexit.
Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track in the midst of Brexit’s supporters, icers and EU attacks.
Allies demanded that they proceed with the deal in spite of the rebound with Brussels and would force the Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their package and the “chasiness”.
Bone said in the gathering at Leave Means Leave in Soli Hull that he wanted to “opt out of Chequers’ plan”.
He recommended that Farage be a partner and give him responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
At his responsibility, we would now be out," he said.
A member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: “I stand out for Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan.”
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to create our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The opinion that British people have changed their minds and want to remain is not true.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Tory Brexit, was also on the march and told the reporters: “I just say one: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote in favour, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk along the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening.”
With a message addressed to May, he added: “The Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said that politicians who were in the assembly must be put to “feel” when they plan to betray the decision made on the 2016 referendum.
It is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political order” he said.
They try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that “we won’t let it happen.”
In the message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who is on the brink of Brexit betrayal, feel uncomfortable.
We will mobilize the People's Army of the country that gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, local, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the remains marched through Birmingham before a two-hour gathering in the centre of the city.
A handful of activists flew slogans against “Torid against Brexit” after creating a group this weekend.
The Liberal Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues that became a part of their party’s app opening the conference.
These are the people who say that IT systems can align and deliver all technology to Canada and more, for seamless border crossings, for cross-border trades to Ireland,” he added.
It is a full far.
Such a thing as good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering to be president of the petition
According to US Elizabeth Warren, after an election in November, she is seriously considered as president of the petition
Boston Globe announces that Massachusetts's democracy spoke about its future on Saturday at West Massachusetts Town Hall.
Warren, President Donald Trump's frequent critic, will apply for the official representative of the GOP against Geoff Diehl, who was Vice President of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign at Trump in November.
It is speculated that it may turn out to be against Trump in 2020.
Saturday’s afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the town hall after Trump took office.
The person present asked if he or she planned to apply for the president.
Warren replied that “women have the time to go to Washington and improve our broken government, that is, also on the forefront”.
LSU Sims shooting took place in arrest
In LA Police Baton Rouge, on Saturday, reported that the suspect of the death of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson around 11 o’clock in the morning at the ET news conference.
They unveiled the video of the Friday shooting, asking for help in identifying the man seen in the shots.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.

Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World title after team accounting gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that point on, it became clear that Valteri Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton that the Mercedes team’s ranking plays a big role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost neglected Hamilton when he first defended his position and called Vettel to attack his teammate.
The water first went to box stops and left the back of the Hamilton group in heavy traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went to lead side by side when the Ferrari driver was reluctant to leave the inner side free after attempting to protect it with a double movement on the third bend.
Max Verstappen started the competition from the back row of the grid and was on the seventh position at the end of his 21-year birthday.
He then led the competition for most of the time, driving towards the finish line in the lines of the rubbers, and passing Kimi Räikkönen, taking the fourth place.
He finally drove to the box stop on the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed with the last eight laps, which gave Räikkönen the fourth place.
Today is a hard day, because Valter worked well for a whole week and was a real gentleman by letting me down.
The team has done a great job to have one of the two,” said Hamilton.
It was a very poor body language
President Donald Trump conceived at the senator Dianne Feinstein’s Saturday gathering because of the incident that he had not leaked the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, which accused of the Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When talking about the assembly of West Virginia, the President did not address directly the testimony given by Ford before the Senate’s Legal Affairs Committee, but instead he commented on what was happening in the Senate, which shows that people are “sisters, nasty and liars”.
The only thing that can happen and that is happening in the Senate in a couple of days is that you see anger and angry, wicked, nasty, and false people,” he said.
When I look at the press releases and the leaks that are said to be: “Oh, I did not do it.
I didn’t do it.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Do you leak a document?” – “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t leak.”
Wait a moment.
Did we leak ... no, we didn’t leak,” he added with the Senator’s appearance.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein about the charges that were about to be taken by the Plannaught and it was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill said: “I did not hide the accusations of Dr. Ford and leaked his story,” Feinstein said to the Committee.
He asked me to maintain my confidentiality and, according to his request, I did so.”
But his denial was not suitable for the president, who commented at the time of the Saturday’s gathering: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but it’s one of the worst body languages I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing the defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court accused of the sexual misconduct of the three women, the President suggested that the democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
They have decided to take back the power without choosing funds.
You will see this wickedness and disgust; they will not be interested in whom they hurt, who they need to drive over to gain power and leadership,” the President of Mediate said.
Elite: Dundee Stars 5: 3 Belfast Giants
Giants Patrick Dwyer created two goals against Dundee
Dundee Stars won the Friday elite league reunion on Saturday at Belfast Giants, who lost to Dundee 5:3.
Giants early settled in the game with two gates led by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie before Dwyer led Giants again.
Francois Bouchard equated to Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
It was the third loss for the elite Adam Keefe men, they came to Belfast on Friday night to win the Dundee as of 2:1.
It was the fourth meeting of the half-season, of which Giants won the three previous games.
Dwyer’s opening gate came in the fourth minute 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaulli and David Rutherford, when Beauvillier doubled his progress four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back in a quick 13:10 game before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit the tie gate in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured that Giants would lead before the first break, kicking the first third at the end of his evening to the second gate.
On the home court, the players converged again, and Bouchard put them back to the level, defeating the gate of 27:37 minutes in numerical excess.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a first lead position at the end of the second third of the game, securing the last third victory in the attack zone of his team.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will meet Milton Keynes in the next game at home.
The pilot dies to save hundreds of people from the earthquake
One of Indonesia's air traffic controllers was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure a safe take-off of the aircraft carrying hundreds of people.
The great earthquake that hit the island of Sulawes on Friday caused tsunami, as a result of which more than 800 people were killed, many of whom have been missing.
The area is plagued by strong pushes and many people are trapped under the ruins in Palu.
Despite the 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled to Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri from the volatile air tower of the airport, he refused to leave.
He remained at work to ensure a safe take-off of Batik Air flight No. 6321, which was at the same time on the runway.
He then jumped out of the air tower, thinking it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, confirmed that his decision could save hundreds of human lives, reported Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to transport him from the Balikpapan of Kalimantan to another city’s major hospital.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
We were extremely sad when we heard about it.” added a spokesperson.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may increase to thousands, and said the country's disaster relief agency, access to the town of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong was limited.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency, said: “The number of deaths may increase because the bodies of many victims are still under ruins and have not been saved.”
6-metre waves ravaged the town of Palu, where mass burial took place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: “The ambulance brings new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we can’t say what they can find there.
It is already a tragedy, but the situation can go even worse.”
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the state military: “Please work nights and days to perform all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this?” the CNN announced.
Earlier this year, Indonesia's city of Lombok was hit by an earthquake in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia air accident: According to Air Niugin airline, one man is missing after a lagoon crash
Although it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft, an airline now claims that one man has disappeared from a crashed aircraft in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia.
Air Niugini said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not find one male traveler.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find a man.
The airline did not immediately answer any questions regarding the passenger’s details, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when landing on the Chuuk Island aerodrome.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane drove over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American traveler, said that the plane drove very low when it landed.
It’s very good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to doubt the height of the belt in the water to the emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin staff was panic and shouted and that he received a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy and the sailors who worked on the nearby berth also helped rescue by using inflatable boats to move people to the shore before the plane sank under water about 30 meters.
Flight safety network data show that 111 people have died in air accidents involving airlines registered for PNGs over the last two decades, but none of them have been associated with Air Niugin.
Analyst compiles a schedule of evenings when a woman was burned alive
The Public Prosecutor’s Office closed the case on Saturday for the re-examination of a man charged with the incineration of a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours analyzing intelligence data as an expert observer.
He pointed out to the jury how he used cell phone call extracts to recreate the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers at the night when the maid died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed that he received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that the order had been with Chambers the night a girl died, which was in conflict with the young man's previous claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in town on that day.
When the accusers asked him if the client had spoken the truth when he said that he had been in Sanford’s car, Sanford said that he “ lied because my car was in Nashville”.
Another disharmony was that Tellis said he had known Chambers about two weeks before his maiden died.
Phone statements showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after the death of Chambers, Ordered deleted Chambers messages, calls, and contact information from your phone.
He deleted the maid from his life,” Hale said.
The defence is planning to make a court speech on Sunday.
The judge said that he thinks that the case will be heard by the jury in the later half of the same day.
The High Breed: what is a conscious hip hop?
Hip Hop trio wants to fight negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed from Bristol argues that hiphop has removed from the beginnings of its political messages and social problem solving.
They want to go back to the hip-hop roots and make the conscious hip-hop again popular.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently gained popularity in the UK thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Yet another black?!
New York babysitter complains of a racist message after a couple of courts
A New York nanny complains of discriminatory dismissal after a couple of unsolicited messages from her family, where her mother complained that the nanny was “another black.”
Couples deny that they are racists compared to the situation of extortion.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her resentment when she learned that their new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying: “EIIIIII, RESULTY BLACK.”
But instead of sending it to his wife, he sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, after his misunderstanding, triggered Miss Maurice, claiming that their sociable nanny, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for a Filipino in his place.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice sues a couple to receive compensation for dismissal, which he wants to receive daily for $350 in the amount of the following six months, and the same work he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
I want to show them with it to look, so do,” he said to the newspaper The Post, adding, “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple have rejected the claim that they were racist, saying that it was reasonable to stop working with Maurice because they feared that after offending the maid they could no longer trust him.
My wife sent her something she didn't think.
He is not a race.
We are not racists,” said wife Joel Plasco to the newspaper The Post.
But would you give your children to keep a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was involuntary?
Your newborn?
Be now.”
Commenting on the comparison with the extortion, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was ‘in a very difficult situation’.
Would you go against someone like this?
This is now not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the case is still in progress, the public opinion has been condemned by a few quick times on social media, where they are grossly judged by their behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that the readers would not relate to the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born immediately after the book was adopted, said: "It is difficult to put himself in the shoes of a person who read it for the first time before publication.
It is very fun to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.”
He said that his father, receiving inspiration for writing a children’s book about a little teddy bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic after his work was postponed, and added that the 60th anniversary of the issue of the book was with a puppet shelter due to the death of his father last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family,” he further added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
He was a fairly quiet man and was not a proud person,” he said.
But because Paddington was so real for him, it was like a feeling when your child achieves something: you are proud of them, although it is not directly your achievement.
I believe that he looked at the success of Paddington in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and had to say goodbye to her by phone
Landing, his daughter was taken to a hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked in vain to save his life.
They called regularly to say that the daughter's condition was very bad and that they do not believe that she would survive," said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I received a call from Nadi, who said that my daughter would die within two minutes and I must say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
Soon we will see.
Soon I am with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to pass his heart had started to disappear quietly and he left the body.
He was dead a little before that, and now all systems began to stop working.
I only had to sit there and wait, knowing what all happens.
I couldn’t go wild, scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her daughter, went on an airplane with other passengers who knew nothing about her experiences.
No one knew it,” he said.
I kept my head on the ground and tears flowed all this time.
It’s hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outburst of condolences against Nadi on this flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved him.”
Greedy woman's postcards prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide, work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pasted maps on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Prl Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Prl Davis, living in Lydney, said that his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile will make the whole room shine.”
Nevertheless, he stopped working before death because he was “with his very bad place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I constantly worry it has a domino effect.”
Prl Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with his friend.
Don’t be quiet – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after the death of her mother.
He did not say that he would feel bad or would be depressed or something,” he said.
We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
She was at her lowest point at Christmas Day – when children opened their gifts, she had no eye contact with them or anything.”
Prl Humphreys said that the death of a man was a terrible trauma to them, but they must handle it: “It tears the wound into the whole family.
It snatches us into pieces.
But we have to go ahead and continue the fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the tip of the hair while the FBI begins the investigation
I believed that if we could actually get something he wanted – with limited time and scope of research – we might be able to achieve unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee “falls together” in the midst of a permanent blockage of partisans.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican want the FBI to investigate it?
Their reluctance was due to the era.
In just five weeks, on 6 November, when the republicans do not do well as expected, they are remarkably weakened in their intentions to become the world’s highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call the senators by lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
Voting takes place in the Senate, where 51 republicans and 49 democracies are currently present.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to vote decisively and to confirm the Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of force runs 'shrinks' under Kim's government
South Korean legislation has said that the number of North Korean military runners in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted by the Ministry of Harmonization in South Korea, said that in comparison with the 2011 military runners (2706) their number has decreased last year (1127).
Mr Park said that key factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China, and a greater number of traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
A large number of North military runners have been offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul magazine claims that there are more than 30 000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953 to illegally cross the border.
Most fled through China, which has the longest country border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized area between the two Koreans.
China takes military runs as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to homeland with power.
The North and South Korea relations, which are technically still in war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of suspended nuclear weapons.
This happened after the June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-uni in Singapore, where they generally pledged to work towards the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of a lack of progress in sanctions.
Without trusting the United States, our country lacks security certainty, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to make ourselves unilaterally unarmed first,” said Mr. Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said that the man was unfit as a Supreme Court judge
The opposition manager of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelos, appointed the Judge of the Supreme Court as ‘hysterical’ of Brett Kavanaugh and said that the man is temperamentally unfit to work as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi gave an opinion on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I inevitably noticed that if a woman had appeared in this way, she would have been called hysterical,” said Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony given before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaught emotionally denied the accusations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
In his opening speech, Kavanaught was very emotional, describing his family and high school years, he was almost screaming from time to time and remained speechless at times.
He also expressly condemned the members of the Democratic Party within the Committee, calling charges against him for the loss of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election as a "grotesque and coordinated assassination" of the angry liberals.
According to Pelosi, he believes that the Kavanaugh certificate proved that the man was not a judge of the Supreme Court, since it showed that he has been biased against the democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and with the way he attacked Clinton and the democracies,” he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if he tried to remove him from office in case of confirmation by Kavanaugh, if the democrats were to get the majority at the House of Representatives.
I say so much – if he does not speak truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only a judge of the Supreme Court, but he is also suitable for the court where he currently works,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the District Court of Appeal of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat he was concerned about possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Health Act – Translator Note) or Roe v. Wade (Abort Legal Court Precedent – Translator Note), because a man is considered a conservative judge.
At its confirmation session, Kavanaught avoided any questions as to whether it would annul some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
At the moment, there is no time where a hysterical biased person could become a judge and wait for us to say that it is not nice,” Pelosi said.
And women must wear it.
It's a fair speech, months and years of over-thinking anger, and it can't get out of it without crying.
“We cry how angry we get,” Ms Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don’t think it’s unusual, or?”
He continued: “I received help from a woman who was a leader somewhere; he said that he also cried when he became angry, but he worked out a method that consisted in the fact that when he became angry and weeping, he said to a person that “You may think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry.”
And he just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partially accepted as rage output because they are understood fundamentally wrong.
One of my brightest memories is from one early job in an office with the majority of men, where I once found myself crying in the indescribable fury when one of the older women – a strict leader I had always feared – I was grabbed by the collar and transported to the stairwell.
Never show them crying,” he told me.
They do not know that you are furious.
They think you’re sad and it offers them satisfaction.”
Patricia Schroeder, the then Democratic Party congression from Colorado, had worked together with Gary Hart at the male presidential campaigns.
In 1987, while Hart missed the out-of-marital love story on the Monkey Business yacht and ended the campaign, he thought deeply irritated Schroeder had no reason why he shouldn’t think about applying for the president himself.
It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” he said to me 30 years later when he laughed.
There were already seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was someone else’s joining.”
Someone said it’s like “Snow white and seven dwarfs”.
Since the campaign was about to end, he was late in saving money, and he promised that he wouldn’t apply if he didn’t meet two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1000 to men, gave him only $250.
“Do they think I get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave a speech, where he announced that he would not launch the official campaign, feelings – thanks to the people who supported him, the irritability to the system, which made it difficult to turn to voters instead of fundraising and delegates, and anger against sexism – he was so victorious that he came into a tears into the throat.
You would have thought that I had a nervous shock,” Schroeder recalled the response against him.
“I could have thought that Kleenex is my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they write on my tombstone.
He cried?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
According to experts, the interstate divide between the US and China was deaf and, although the battle is far from over, can be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning bill this year by levying taxes on significant Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation this week took place with new tariffs for $200 billion (€150 billion) per item, essentially leviing taxes on goods arriving from China to the USA.
Beijing has responded with the same response every time, with the last 5 to 10 percent tariffs of $60bn worth of American goods.
China has promised the U.S. to respond by shot, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to be blinking as soon as possible.
Getting Washington to retreat would mean giving up the demands, but public worship in front of the US would be too embarrassing to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing outright, the trade war with the US could support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a loss of control of the economy in another country is actually much more dangerous than the bystanders have previously recognised,” said researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asian research at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the state is ready for voluntary return of refugees and asks for more than seven years of war in the reconstruction of the state.
When speaking with the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the situation would improve in the country.
At the moment, the situation is more stable and secure in the national territory, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to bring normality back.
Now there are all conditions for refugees who have left the country voluntarily to return to the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the UN forecast, 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime is happy to accept help building a devastated country.
However, it emphasised that the State did not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe grabbed the victory of the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team at Le Golf National Golf Golf Course near Paris in France at the end of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points to win the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who had been hit throughout the tournament, wore a kick-off in par-3 to 16 waters, surrendering the victory to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have achieved 5:0:0 in the current 1979 tournament format.
For American Jordan Spieth, the result of 5&4 was made by Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest-ranked Dane in the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson outperformed the English Ian Polter with 2 and 1, to whom this Ryder Cup could last be held.
From the eight veterans of the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia, the winner of the 25.5 career point competition all the time, became the European.
I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t keep myself back.
It has been a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy so happy we got back to the cup.
It’s in the spirit of the team and I’m glad to help me,” said emotional Garcia after winning Europe.
He passes the torch to his compatriot Jon Rah, who won 2&1 in the single American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday.
I feel extraordinary pride that Tiger Woods won – I grew up looking at him,” said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now he has a career in Ryder Cup result of 13: 21:3.
Strange stats for one of the best players of all time, winning 14 major competitions, remaining behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The US team was a bouquet of fairways throughout the weekend; with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk, after the team's disappointment, said performance: "I'm proud of the guys, they were guilty.
In the morning there were moments when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought with them.
Hat off in front of Thomas.
He is a great master.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let’s sum up, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and go on.
I love these 12 types and I am proud to be their master.
You need to raise the hat.
We were better played.”
New information on water flowering: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasotas
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a reduction in the overall concentration of blooming algae in the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the FWC, there are reports of more concise prosperity in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which refer to decreasing concentrations.
The extent of water bloom is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas county to the south of Lee County.
Spots can be found 10 miles (16 km) away from the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer spots compared to the previous week.
The water bloom has also been observed in Pasco county.
Last week, Pinellas County has reported average concentration on the coast or offshore, Hillsborough County from low to high concentration on the offshore, Manatee County from background to high concentration, Sarasota Coast and offshore from background to high concentration, Charlotte County from background to medium concentration, Lee County coast and offshore from background to high concentration, and Collier County from low concentration.
The counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier continue to receive reports of respiratory irritation.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida within a week.
