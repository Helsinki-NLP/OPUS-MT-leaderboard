Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in Spain under the name Slava Kemerovski, in a criminal world.
In Spain, Guleovich was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also took three of the suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
According to suspicion, it is called Kemerovo criminal community members aged 27-57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
The alleged leader of the criminal association was detained in Mija, Malaga, Spain.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia, one of them has been gathered according to the data of a leading criminal association, and two are members of a criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles clearly shared within the criminal organisation were clearly defined.
The aim of the criminal community was to commit drug offences and thus earn criminal income", commented Vahur Verte, head of the criminal proceedings.
We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in the criminal case in question," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously found themselves in the interests of law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
International cooperation has become common for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation", commented prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said that the detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted almost a year and a half.
In the first half of the week long-term work was carried out, and at the same time we were detained in Estonia and Spain," he said.
The finding added that the officials of the Central Criminal Police were helpful in detention in Spain.
For years, we have a good contact and understanding of the Spanish police and the civilian card forces.
These detentions are yet another messages to criminals that we can receive them from another European end", said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that in freedom, the suspect men may continue to commit new crimes, so the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash seized in the context of this criminal case have been seized to ensure confiscation.
Pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the office of crimes organised by the Central Criminal Police and led by the Office of the Prosecutor General.
The Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion in 2005 and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in Estonia’s criminal world after the all-world leader Nikolai Tarankov at the time.
In the early 1990s, Guleevich from Kemerovo became prominent in the Estonian underworld when he began dealing with extortion in Tallinn.
He reportedly charged taxi drivers and prostitutes with various hotels and charged businessmen with a monthly roof tax.
International joint operations, criminal income confiscation and judgments that have entered into force confirm that the fight in organised crime is effective.
For example, the most recent judgments, the eight accuseds separated from the criminal matter of the so-called Dikajev criminal association, who had seized the criminal income of 80 000 euros, or the judgment of nine persons, in 2006 that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association aimed at illicit trafficking of secret cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Ida-Virumaa and Southern Estonia.
Confiscated criminal income is approximately 71 500 euros.
The success of these criminal cases is that police officers exchange information and prosecutors’ evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, take action together in any EU country.
The Civil Rights Group warns about travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri of state discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group statement states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the Missouri state, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and Missourins to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when moving around the whole state, given the suspicious race-based events that have recently taken place across the state and also been listed here."
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning both by the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win discrimination-related cases, and by the fact that the state’s law enforcement targets are in unequal terms with minorities.
"Citizenship rights of people are violated.
They are drawn to the edge of the road due to their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said NAACP Missouri Branch president Rod Chapel in The Kansas City Star.
We have never received such frequent complaints before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Black-skin Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year after he ran out of the state and was arrested by the Missouri Police without being accused of a crime.
In addition, note refers to a recent report by the Prosecutor General of Missouri, which shows that Black Drivers are suspended in the state with a 75% higher probability than Whites.
The note is meant to be aware of people and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
People need to be prepared, then mean taking bail money or informing relatives that they will pass through the state."
Based on the latest data from the FBI’s hate crime report program, 100 hate crime was documented in Missouri in 2015, which places the state in 16th place in terms of the number of similar violations.
Travel alert is also in response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult for a company to complain about finding housing or work for discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel remarks on Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that obliged local people to arrest for immigration violations, because according to ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have begun to use this measure as a counter reaction to certain US laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what should everyone know about the various forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different - hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, with a malignant expense, chronic hepatitis B and C is a disease that can further develop into cirrhosis of the liver, i.e. creasing of the liver and liver cancer.
Kulo Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Health Board, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stool, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowness of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last characteristic of the disease is also the folk name of liver inflammation jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can proceed without any symptoms.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory test data.
Acute hepatitis can transition to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without symptoms, which means that a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kulo Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the faeces of infected person to the hands and from his hands to food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth and consuming drugs.
The risk group for hepatitis A includes the family members and carers of the affected person, people with chronic liver diseases, people having sex with the infected person, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting high spread countries of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented in vaccinations, in particular it is recommended for people travelling a lot and who are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet the daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before cooking.
Hepatitis B viruses spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using objects contaminated with blood (toothbrushes, shavings), donor blood, having sex with a suspicious person, and being infected with hepatitis from mother to fetus/vascular.
The risk group for infection of hepatitis B includes injected drug addicts, sex partners of infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of infected mother, family members and caregivers of sick mother, health care workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other bodily fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high disease of hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people belonging to the risk group, as well as people with chronic liver diseases, with HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and people with diabetes.
Other prevention measures of hepatitis B are: the prevention of the use, tattooing and piercing of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharp means and needles of syringes, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex or prevention of sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread when exposed to a sick person’s blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using objects contaminated with blood, having sex with a donor blood, a person suspected of being infected with hepatitis, and from a mother to a fetus/newborn.
The risk group for infection of hepatitis C includes injecting drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, family members and caregivers of a sick mother, health care workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other bodily fluids, people with HIV infection, and passengers travelling to countries with high diseases of hepatitis C.
Hepatitis C is a preventive measure of prevention: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharp means and needles of syringes, tattoo and piercing, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or superinfection of chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses spread when in contact with blood and other bodily fluids, the syringes they are contaminated with, the sexually transmitted and rarely infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic virus carriers of hepatitis B and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses spread on a fecal-oral path to drinking water and food, including low-heated beef, fish and clams, donor blood, common syringes, and infected mother to the fetus.
Passengers may become infected with the high disease of hepatitis E in the countries.
The prevention measures of hepatitis E are to meet hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the sick person.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating little cooked beef, fish and food, drink only safe drinking water and avoid consuming drugs.
Although in the last round, the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end and won 26.49.51 in time.
Farah did not think long, pulling his wife Tania and children along to the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful", said Farah to journalists.
Farah is targeting 5000 and 10 000 meters of golden doubles in London.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite its title, Anne-Marie O'Connor dives into the "Dam in gold: the extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait," one of the births of a piece of art, much deeper into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But even more closely in history.
The amount of awe-inspiring information would have worn off, i.e., a harder curl, a narrower theme would let the extraordinary story in the title get more impact.
Currently, there would be two books between one of the covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in Gustav Klimt and his painting "Dam in gold", and a much more extensive and comprehensive history book about the Jewish families and German occupation with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of the city, and who came to Austria itself, can easily imagine how life around Ringstrasse for more than a hundred years went to life or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Café when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and seeing a familiar name in the book, you will feel like a gram of culture.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where he synonymous with untreated syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe does not add anything to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, every paired brush stroke adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream about a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews had exploded in Vienna, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century almost every tenth resident of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele’s parents were newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married Ferdinand Bloch, a Czech sugar magnate, and Klimt was posing for his famous paintings, his father’s bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele was not attracted by all the glamorous life he belonged to.
If you look at the "Dam's Gold", it is difficult to believe that this great lady from the end of life became infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903 when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife's portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimti’s order cost 4000 kroons at the time, a quarter of a well-located country house price.
The fact that in some portraits the master’s love story was suspected with the model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only fact is that the relationship between the model and the artist that arose during the work continued until the end of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The Lady of gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt’s masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer’s portrait”, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before work with Adele, Klimt had gone to the Basilica of San Vita in Ravenna, and researchers think that it was the brilliant mosaics seen there that the Empress of Theodoras gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dam's Gold" in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time (in 1907-1908) was born another golden painting of "Kiss".
Art historians did not miss the similarity of two women.
How is the story related to Hitler?
In memory of my friend Klimt, I owe her to make her handwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family’s Klimt collection would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adela.
Also in his will (Adele left in February 1925), he asked his wife to leave two portraits and four of Gustav Klimt’s landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
He bequeathed his jewellery to Maria and Luise, his nephews.
A year after Klimt had graduated from "Austria's Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts at the 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed at the drawing exam.
Although sometimes Hitler’s subsequent anti-Semitism is believed to be the reason for not accepting him into the academy by the Jewish professors, none of his examiners are actually Jews.
Anyhow, the Austrian Gallery’s role in the Maria will had changed markedly by 1939 – it had become important to find works that the Nazi Party liked from the rich collections of Jewish art in Vienna.
Hitler’s personal art treasures were also matched by some of Adele’s works at home, but not those at Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi art abduction, a ten-year litigation began between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauers.
It should be noted here that if "Kiss" is seen in Belvedere Palace, Vienna, then the "Daam's Gold" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen in New York City's Neue Galeries.
And read the above book before driving in Vienna.
Even if you don’t plan to go to Klimt’s work, because at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish paintings than $135 million after closing the book, and the Adele Bloch-Bauer model.
So not so much portrait as the fate of the family - and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree at the beginning of the book greatly facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In pre-swimming, Gold was very close to its own 200 m private record for back-swimming when swimming 2.16.62.
The top brand dates back to 17 years ago when the Canadian Junior Championship took place on 2.16.58, Priit Aaviku will mediate a Swimming Blog.
Gold became the last or tenth A-finals.
In the finals, he passed a distance of 2.15.76 and gained a great seventh place with a new powerful top stamp.
From the Estonian record (2.15.13) owned by Alina Kendzior, Gold remained divorced a little over half a second.
In the rankings of all times in Estonia, Gold became third and its fresh personal top brand is the fifth result of all times in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is yet to start at the Canadian Adult Championship in 100m, 200m and 400m free swimming and 200m and 400m complex swimming.
Last week, Canadian junior championship took place in Toronto and Gold also made successful starts there.
He won a 200m free swimming silver medal in time 2.03.22.
This distance was so quickly flown by the Estonians last in 2008.
Only the Estonian record woman Elina Partõka has swimd this distance faster than Gold ever.
Estonians living in Canada won the bronze medal in the 100m free swimming with excellent personal record and the top stamp of the new Estonian season with 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year earlier, has swimming this distance just one century faster.
To the personal peak brand, he received a letter from 1.03,69 in the opening of the message swimming when he arrived at 100 m in the back swimming.
At a longer distance of half, he only achieved seventh place when swimming in the finals of 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season’s leaderboard at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpening teeth
The holiday season is here - that is to say also relaxation for President Donald Trump.
However, as Trump has been one of the presidents who have taken out the most holiday days so far, critics already sharpen their teeth.
According to US Today and CNN, the president’s plan is to spend a 17-day holiday at the proprietary Bedminster Golf Club, which is located in New Jersey.
Although the president’s holiday started yesterday, Trump’s opponents have already taken a week on holiday.
They complain about spending too much rest on Trump.
Namely, it is customary for the president to spend weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president during his 196 days of office.
For example, George W. Bush arrived on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama was half as much as Trump, just 21 days.
However, Trump tends to forget things quickly.
Read days after becoming President, Trump, sending "60 minutes", said that there would be no time for long holidays in his office, as it is very much necessary to do it.
He also expressed his resentment about Barack Obama’s holiday three years ago.
At that time, the current president wrote on Twitter: "When Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS cuts the heads from the top".
According to the officials of the White House, a 17-day golf club visit is not really a relaxation.
This is officially called a work holiday, during which Trump does not have time to read or other favorite activities.
In addition, there was another reason for working leave.
Namely, the air conditioning system in the western wing of the White House is replaced and therefore all staff had to leave it.
There is also a Oval cabinet in the western wing and other premises of the president.
I do not think that someone from you would like to be in the western wing in August, if there are 38 degrees and there is no air conditioning,” said Lindsay Walters, spokesman for the White House, who emphasized that the President will continue to work during the holiday.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you will get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook  do not apply to the State Agency if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew so much about the unfavourable media coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for newspapers to kick him off for everything from internal politics to political principles.
Of course, criticism upset him.
But he did not force his critics to silence.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "the freedom of expression can be taken away from us, and in silence and dumb, we may be led to the slaughter of sheep".
This brings me to Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who struggles to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) appealed to the court.
The Governorate stamped the action void, and the online comments swarmed from counter-reactions in the style of "Who is interested?".
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But that reads though.
And it reads especially much when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
Its approval rate ranks second best among the 50 Governors of the country.
Hogan is not an unthinkable responsive snoozer.
He has led the state on a firm hand and remained strictly determined by his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook rather proficiently as the main tool when communicating with his voters, presenting his bald head for the first time after chemotherapy.
Thus, the Governor’s page , which is a public forum with an official label, managed by the staff receiving income from taxpayers’ dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people who are posting .
A Hogan spokesman Amelia Chasse defended Governor’s behaviour in the interview given to The Washington Post, claiming that the blockage of comments was nothing but moderation.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spammers or people full of anger.
The Post chatted with several real people who Hogan blocked.
And that’s exactly what they are  real people who communicate with their chosen managers.Teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, from Maryland Bowie, did not incite hatred, but real hate crimes.
I politely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote The Post in the comment section.
I also do not like the idea that how many people comment on the same topic, calls it an indifferent collective effort instead of admitting that it is a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor’s official called the "targeted spam attack" would probably call others "public support".
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
The thing is much cleaner than in the old days, when to do the same, the workers had to be expelled to collect newspapers with critical guide letters and to burn them or arrest protesters, and to force them to silence.
But that’s exactly what happens right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for making Facebook and other social media channels bite.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked him from the Twitter stream.
One of the first landmark judgments on this issue was made last week in Virginia.
James C. Cacheris, a U.S. district judge, decided in Alexandria that the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Loudoun County violated the first correction of the Constitution when he blocked the voter on his Facebook page.
At Kentucky, ACLU visited Facebook and Twitter as well as Governor Matt Bevin (R).
It should not be so difficult.
During Washington, affordable postage costs had a similar effect than on the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 quadrupled newspapers, and anonymous writers hurled his leadership.
And even then Washington had to poke the breast with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington decisions landless.
According to the historical documents gathered in the context of the online George Washington letter collection project, he was buried under the Cabinet’s petitions, which criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not force them to silence.
Freedom of expression, dissenting opinions and discussions are the cornerstones of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of its home territory in Renaissance Club
The former European number Ronan Rafferty expects the comfort of the home territory for the next three days when 25 Scottish Senior Open will take place on the golf course of East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The North Ray, who pre-directed Paul Eales on the nearby Archerfield Links tracks in the last year, is fond of the new venue and plays the role of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvid instead of the tournament ambassador.
I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club shines with this event in full splendour,” Rafferty said.
"Players will see the track in its best form, it is in a glorious condition.
Jerry has done a great job in building this place.
He is a keen supporter of the golf game and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This allows the track to be perfectly presented."
English Eales is looking forward to being able to defend his title for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32 years of career.
This is accompanied by a very special feeling," said Southport's nesting player.
I could not defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off the race calendar one year after my victory.
It is magical to come back to it.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon the victory of last year was special.
It was a very special time we are always in the heart.”
Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour for the beginning of the year when he got 50, returns to the competition.
It is his first event in Scotland after participating in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"At home to play is always a bit more meaningful," said Helensburgh man Orr.
You want to perform well, but at the same time feel extra tension.
I have enjoyed playing again immensely and showed quite a decent game of golf.
I am satisfied with the progress of things so far.”
The former winner of the Masters tournament, Ian Woosnam, and the senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty, join Trio.
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the competition, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free and car parking costs £5 and £10 for two or more passengers.
All income goes to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesian bully land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, he does not use the stove.
He even uses a pot rarely.
In a wooden cabin in Enarotal, the capital of the regent of Papua Province Paniai, Indonesia, the resident’s local language places the sweet potato called ‘nota’ directly on the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the heat and washed with unwashed hands eagerly into the skin.
Degei sits on the floor of the mud  she does not have  and also does her everyday household chores, for example washing with cloudy water from the sex nearby.
The role of the toilet is filled with a bucket in an unroofed room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband's four women, she is not assigned to care for any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, late work can be dangerous  most of the village's men are unemployed and many of them drink hard, in addition there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around in the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after the controversy caused a referendum, during which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote in the arms of the occupants by raising their arms.
The movement that encouraged the liberation of the Dutch from supremacy quickly directed its fury against the government of Jakarta, which still keeps the region under its strong control, keeping away from foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was formally subdivided into Papua and Western Papua, so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained the eastern part of the island.
In order to get there, you have to fly from the capital city of the province, Jayapura, to Nabire for 90 minutes, and then go on a five-hour journey with your rental car.
There is no public transport.
A city with about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered with wavy iron roofs, which have turned different shades of rust into yellowish-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, not to mention journalists, nor have they visited foreign nationals at all.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the pauds of Mee Pago worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
Other changes also took place.
We weren’t used to wearing such clothes,” says Degei, referring to her colourful hand-woven peat, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before that, we only wore plant leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's bully land.
Just 100 km from Pania, the mountainous province of New Jersey with a population of around 153 000, is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, belonging to Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined around US$3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua can boast of consumer wood stocks with an estimated value of USD 78 billion.
But these riches are the source of the suffering of papahs, for they necessitate the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian military.
The 2005 study of The New York Times showed that Freeport paid approximately USD 20 million to local military personnel and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 to a single officer.
The efforts of the papules to ensure greater autonomy threaten it in the golden, and they go mercilessly around.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 paupas have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killing of genocide in the highlands belonging to the Papuan tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 report of the Archbishopric of Birsbane "We lose everything" contains testimonies of the cruelties committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture (according to another report, particularly rape and electric shocks) and brutal suppression of peaceful protests.
It is difficult to count the number of victims because such incidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, researcher at Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
Screws are still tightened stronger because Papua's natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demography is changing, as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the Indonesian populous islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanese family canteens sell gado gado gado served with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals are unable to compete with them.
Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables cheaper than local papayas in the traditional market," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province for work.
"Indigenous papals  papua mama-mama'd [women]  will therefore lose its market share."
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, known as Jokowi, promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in his 2014 election campaign in Papua.
The former carpenter won the presidential palace of Jakarta from Papua 29 electoral district 27, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed and locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014, we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes in connection with the restoration of justice," says You.
In fact, Paniai was afflicted only two months after Jokow took office in a low position in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs at Enarotal campfire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from darkness.
The children who met told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to a native pastor Yavedt Tebai's talk, one of the soldiers offended their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, drunken soldiers chased children behind them and beat them with the handles of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot among the children.
One child, Yulianus Yeimot, aged 16, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby electoral committee was on fire and the next day, things escalated even further.
Around 1000 young men, women and children from Papua gathered for justice to the football field in front of the local police station and the military control centre.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance of the papaya honey pago tribe, during which a circle was run and a bird song was imitated.
Some protesters began to loop at police and military rocks.
When the anxieties were exacerbated, soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio. "If the crowd points more than three times resistance, let them down," they said according to the official document that TIME has seen, but has not been released to local media outlets.
Enarotal town of Kego Koto, elder of the district Yeremias Kayame (56) felt a threatening threat and called for peace to be preserved, asking the crowd to go home.
Nobody wants to listen.
When I turned around, I was suddenly shot to the left wrist," he told the magazine TIME in his bright colours on the treehouse veranda.
Kayame still does not know who was the shooter, but says that the moon came from the lines of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, there was plenty of water," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw, according to his cousin who saw his shooting, was hit three times.
I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that it is with him," said TIME to the magazine grimly Yohanes, who uses only one name in the way of many Indonesians.
I saw that she was dead... I kissed her."
Yotje Mende, Chief Police Officer of Papua, told the reporters that he would only be subject to the return of the security of his division, as it was attacked.
We must defend ourselves if we are threatened to kill," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesman for the Papuan Police in 2015.
This is the question of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and had many injuries.
The news of killings arrived in Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapuras gave a passionate speech, where he expressed sympathy to the victims’ families and allowed the abuses that took place in Papua to be dealt with.
I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never repeats in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will establish an extrajudicial mechanism for the resolution of crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, excuses also followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The thing is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
Speaking with TIME on 5 June in Jakarta, Wiranto took his words back, saying that he has no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said "all solved by law".
Wiranto, charged by the United Nations in crimes against human rights in connection with the death of more than 1000 people in East Timor during the bloody referendum in 1999, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including those in Pania.
The families of the Paniai victims adopted such claims with a gloomy distrust.
I have been heard four times in the last three years, but no progress has taken place,” said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
I'm afraid," he says.
I fear that the army will arrest me, I fear that I will be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid to dissect this incident.
He said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bury four victims.
"After burial of dead bodies, the army came to seek me," he says.
Shoots have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired the villagers in the Paniai neighborhood in Deiyai.
One person could die and 17 were wounded, including children, when a conversation was made between the villagers and the head of the construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This male, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who sank into a nearby river when fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested on the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers looped police officers with stones on which the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, the mobile brigade (indonesian army police) began to shoot down the people, killing one person.
We were in great panic, we are afraid of revenge," said Dominggu Badii, 29 years old, who lives near the hospital and saw the entry of injuries on top.
I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the responsibility of the police officers involved and for the removal of the police’s mobile brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a problem place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey, moni, dani and damal tribes living on the lush central highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL)  rebel army, which, according to themselves, defends the rights of papayas, by instigating casual attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, on the pretext of the "protection of the sovereignty of the state", the army has arrested Pania and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in recent years.
Some of them never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty nourishes dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold at Enarotal is too expensive to buy for the locals.
Bread is the same out of reach.
People grow their whole food by themselves  mainly sweet potato, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the yields for the family, the rest sell on the local market.
Ten sweets cost only 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality between indigenous papayas and new migrants who have arrived a lot since the opening of new airlines at Nabire Airport has increased.
These few jobs that exist go better to educated and wealthier migrants.
Papaid himself often lacks capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Council of Paniai tribes.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, strict restrictions remain on foreign media.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, as they did not observe relevant practices, although they had been granted a rare filming permit.
Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of Human Rights Watch’s Asian Department, said that Jokow’s election promises have not been implemented to eliminate the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development.
In Indonesia, new threats threatening journalists from Papua's most Eastern Restless Provinces and Western Papua include  visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a bore gaze from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the close neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries spurred  Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands  UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Armanatha Nasir, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, set aside the accusations of the group, saying to journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so that it would be difficult to bury evidence against human rights."
Local people want more foreign governments to notice.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands chaired the national human rights envoy Kees Van Baar on May 4, Jayapura, the local people interrupted their quietness at the meeting but, according to an anonymous source, asked: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but papals do not believe that they will vote for Jokow again.
Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, chairman of the council of the tribes.
He wants to give Jokow an understanding that, in addition to the constant threat of predatory military life, the people of Paniai are struggling with poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, as well as other booties, consider their voice to be the debt they have to pay.
They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of Paniai shooting victims were still able to cope with the last symbolic resistance  they buried one victim’s body in the land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on foot, they will never let at least the respondents forget about their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus's lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire swallowed Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time
On Friday, fireed through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to escape from this 337 meters high and 79-storey building.
This is another fire that has devastated a high-rise structure in just two years, which is called Torchiks or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no damage was reported and no direct fire caused.
We slept and woke up on fire alarm and shouting people.
We ran down stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” said a resident named George to Reuters.
According to civil defense officials in Dubai, firefighters deleted the flame around 4 am on local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said that they work to provide shelter to the victims.
This incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high-rise buildings around the world.
During a fire investigation conducted after the Torch Board in 2015, it was found that the most damage suffered from facade cladding - decorative panels of the exterior and insulation.
The British police have said that they believe that the insulation and facade panels of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, in which about 80 people perished.
See: These phones are likely to become sales hits in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then the phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were on sale in spring, and new hit phones are also expected to be on store shelves in autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, the marketing and sales director of Tele2, this year the flagship is characterised by an innovative design, an iris scanner, a 4K resolution from the edge to the edge and a high-speed processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has reached the front end of the Estonian smartphone sales table, was a great thrill.
Autumn promises even more agile fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher-quality camera and greater water and dust resistance for smart visitors.
He added that it is already possible to make assumptions based on rumors and predict the top four models that are likely to conquer the sales charts this year.
These four top models of smartphones will reach the supermarkets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach supermarkets in mid-September.
There are many rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it.
If iPhone 7 didn’t bring any significant differences next to iPhone 6s, Apple’s tenth birthday is expected to make the new model stand out completely from the previous ones.
We have talked about four colours: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen that covers the entire front of the phone, the home button has been lost and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple’s Design Manager JonyIve requires the new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
The ceramic version of iPhone has also been discussed.
In addition to iris scanner, wireless charging and an even higher-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
Surely this is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-ordering for the new Galaxy Note 8 will start on August 23.
There have been a leaking number of hearings about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
Notably, even more is designed for business users, and S Pen offers even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrower telephoto lens.
At the moment, no one knows what the two back cameras are, but in any case, it is the first Samsung test that is definitely comparable to iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we expect a tight 23 August.
Although Nokia has been selling three smartphones with Nokia 6 this year, there is still a shortage of their flagship flagship, Nokia 8, which will be presented on August 16.
We expect Nokia’s 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display and ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and a more durable battery.
For Nokia, the IP68 enclosure and the significant degree of water and dust resistance are also discussed.
Like Samsung, the new Nokia model features two rear cameras, which are manufactured by Zeiss.
If Sony's solid flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will soon be added with even more innovative features.
We are looking for a smartphone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony’s new model has speculated that its screen is at least six inches.
What reality brings, we can already see right soon, because traditionally, Sony has announced its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to the leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico on paying for the border wall
The Washington Post unveiled transcripts of telephone calls between President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On 27 January, Trump went on a phone call to Enrique Pena Nieto, President of Mexico, to end the public announcement so that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American President cracked with him for the public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You must not say this to the press."
Trump set his presidential campaign on a pledge to build along the walls of the southern border of the United States and swore to pay for this project in Mexico.
He also published transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveal a tense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees going to Australia was "smiliar", "swimming", and "sruly"; he claimed that the agreement that was made during the reign of Obama would make him look like a "guird" because he had proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended his speech, informing Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not discuss OÜ MRP Linna Linid’s complaint in a case where the city of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of bus routes from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive that rejects OÜ MRP Linna Linid’s tender for the Tartu bus procurement, since the tender did not comply with the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu City Government Law Service.
This is an in-house public bus transport procurement for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court the decision of the Tartu Circuit Court.
The Supreme Court did not accept the matter.
Although many complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their night’s sleep and the whole city is full of drunk parties, there are also many people who don’t have any bad words about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I’m even positively surprised that the store was so polite!
I didn’t see any blurredness or rudeness.
Even I saw a kindness", says the linden Wave.
After all, it’s great that you’re coming, being and being happy about Pärnu, which is like a winter night’s sleep,” he adds cheerfully.
The chunky Wave from the beach does not disturb sleep.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music was played on the beach, now music has not reached his home walls yet.
But I hope to hear," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also talked to Õhtuleht, says that the large festival is rather good for Pärnu – it contributes well to the turnover of local traders.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The party mood of the woman does not interfere.
Although I no longer sunbathe on the beach, it’s nice that the beach has revived.
And it is nice that the people are moving and it has already been so three times", says the woman.
The first time I guess it was a bit worse.
Then perhaps there were complaints, he ponders.
However, the atmosphere on the beach, according to him, is common for summer capitals.
This Weekend is a very good promotion for our small town,” says Harri, who is nesting in the park.
Melu and commotion have not hit her rhythm of life on oscillation either.
But for what?!
We should all save.
Think about how this international communication would be better.
A man of loud music does not become disgusted.
It does not interfere, although I live right there.
"Good people can save and have no trouble", he speaks.
According to the guests who came to Pärnu, they are polite.
They have, of course, exaggerated a little with the bottles, but the young are young and the Lord God - let go, but be people, and we can cope!" he says.
By this time, the residents of the beach have traveled away, either to relatives or acquaintances.
But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of memory", says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnu.
The festival music of his family does not disturb either, although last year it was even further away from this year.
Last summer there was a stage on the other hand, then we heard more.
We live outside of the city ourselves, that actually comes there far along the Pärnu River quite well," he says.
Pearson cuts another 3000 jobs and reduces dividend to revitalize business
Pearson, a British educational company, said on Friday that it will cut another 3000 jobs and reduce its interim dividends by 72 per cent, thus launching another restructuring program to solve the business’s threatening sluggishness.
Losing jobs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will most likely be added to 4000 jobs lost in the previous restructuring process at the end of 2018 and early 2019.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs of another £300 million ($394 million) under the third cost reduction program to try to revitalize the business that has gained a swing due to the rapid transition to digital learning.
A company that agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann last month said that their expectation for the year has not changed since a 1-percent increase was reported to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: a suicide attack killed NATO soldier
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked military convoys in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
The NATO statement stated that five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in an incident in the Qarabaghi district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people died at the Herati Mosque attack.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said that the Thursday night explosion took place when the combined patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "human self-made explosive".
According to the statement, everything is in a stable condition damaged and is treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qatar’s NATO Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb in Kabul mainly killed at least 30 people in the chic district.
According to Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a major bomb attack in the city centre killed more than 150 people - this is the most deadly military attack in the country since US-led troops repelled Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence underlines the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the state army and police.
According to correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public trust crisis against the government, its policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA annulled the decision to postpone the smear following actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA) set aside the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama regulation, which obliges states to limit emissions from smog, one day after 15 states sued the agency as a result of its action.
EPA announced its decision to continue with the "2015 Actions to determine ozone" late Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
We believe that we need to engage in dialogue with and listen to our state partners," said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, the Bride had announced the EPA’s intention to delay the determinations of the ozone content , in which case smearing is measured in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level of air quality should be reduced by one year to meet the stricter air quality standard  in October 2018.
15 On Tuesday, together with the District of Columbia, the democratic state brought an action, claiming that the decision was unlawful.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to pull back several environmental regulations set up by former President Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, is part of a more comprehensive growth recovery plan.
But these aspirations have led to reactions among democracies and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of contaminants on human health.
The EPA website states that the inhalation of air containing ozone "may reduce lung capacity and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
German pigs may have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a party, as heavy rains threaten the crops of another wheat producer in the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it can be done that the precipitation of rainfall for weeks before harvest may mean that the fruit for the bread industry is only suitable for feed for animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than 2015", Agravis Raiffeisen's analyst Bernhard Chilla said.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go into animal feed, which is double compared to the usual, predicted by Agravis.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have come across in all weathers this year.
First the winter was too dry.
Then the cold spring came, which was replaced by a heat wave in June.
In July, Germany hit rainfall, which has continued also in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvests.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not yet begun the harvest, the local harvest buyer, Ceravis, announced.
The "Hand is pretty challenging days", the senior Ceravis trader Frank Deckert from Rendsburg said.
Consistency in everything, i.e. the cunning swings of Finnish interior design
The beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the exhibition halls, as the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms through large windows.
At every step of the way, our northern neighbours’ aspiration to create both crisp and perfect (energy-efficient) homes begins.
Admiration and observance deserve the skills of using wood as construction and finishing material for Finns, furniture and beauty.
Exhilarating techniques and smart solutions can be found in the exhibition halls both by constructor and (home) designer.
It is evident that combinations of black, white and grey shades, if they are supplemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, because the fair will last until 13 August.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
This night, the line was pulled down to Weekend Festival Baltic and Martin Garrix gave her all to remember as the last performer.
At the time of the performance of Garrix, the people were in a real turn - sung, chili, danced prophecy.
When Garrix was finished, the joint mass was spread from Pärnu beach to the city.
We will bring you a gallery with all the images that our photographer tried on Weekend within three days.
Surely you are in some of them, look for yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a crash course to face the nearest future in the most captivating boxing match of up to 66.7 kg in weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in the ESPN office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked at the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's badminton champion.
After the unanimous resolution of Garcia, the victory over the former four-time World Adrien Broner on Saturday Showtime, both fighters belong to the top five of the weighting table.
Garcia handed her right hand and said, "How are you going, champion?
I wish you success."
Lomachenko protects her belt with Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When posing for a couple of photos, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, stated that a possible confrontation between fighters would be a "perfect measurement".
I'm a former feather-weight," recalled Garcia.
"I moved up to [63.5 kg] for the Booker, but I'm not that big.
I am small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move down on light weight.
And he must move upward weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted it.
We will offer them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
In the climate, the question of whether to look at it should be paid is part of his strategy that he wants to have Lomachenko debuted at the end of this year in a class of 61.2 kg in order to make a possible meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who will also have an interest in fighting against Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match winner after their frivolous round at the Forum on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be paid because fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said later, saying he is open to fight on any channel that offers the best financial package.
We are the main actors.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said that she considers Lomachenko to be a "powerful fighter" and can go to look at her Saturday's match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest at the praise of Garcia, saying that he thought the master of the three divisions from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted it to be a nocar."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact strength and then to box.
Both affirmed that they felt the tension growing to force them.
"This is a fight that awaits the realization.
No other confrontation creates so much attention and buzz.
I’m more than ready to work for it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
This will be a good fight."
Which corners of the world are moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued more than 13 000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to work, study or family in Estonia.
If, for example, a temporary residence permit was issued to 6702 aliens last year, then the number was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years this number starts to come close to 2000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the largest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is growing – 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left last year.
The Ukrainian community has been big in Estonia all the time, and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in the country where the community and many of the family are already ahead,” said Kristin Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although for a total of ten years, the largest number of temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter.
If Ukrainians come to work here mostly, Russian citizens for family migration.
Considering the historical Russian community, they are also more likely to have the highest family ties with people living in Russia,” said Helina Maasing, migration researcher at the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences.
If we look at the Russian citizens who have been granted an Estonian residence permit, then Ida-Viru County immediately after Harju County, he added and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have been married to a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, a temporary residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wish to extend their residence permit decreased altogether.
The leap is due to the fact that instead of the extension of the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanently entering Estonia,” explained Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years.
An alien who has lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for settling permanently in Estonia from the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage people who have adapted to remain here.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased due to the new residence permit.
Last year, for example, such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change their work and the Estonian state will no longer be able to catch up with the finger if the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit was very popular - applicants last year were the owners of the grey passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians, and the same number of Chinese, were granted a residence permit for the purpose of settling in Estonia.
With the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
For ten years, Nigeria has become a surprisingly state whose citizens are some of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
If in 2007, three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, then last year 200.
From Nigeria, you need to study at these universities.
Estonian universities are also popular among, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turkish.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased mainly due to mobility.
There is also a rule for them that a community has arisen, more simply comes there," Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If there are about 6000 third-country nationals receiving a residence permit a year, this is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if citizens of the European Union add more migration to about a percentage", Maasing commented that there are actually small numbers.
According to Statistics Estonia, 14 822 people migrated to Estonia last year and 13 792 migrated from here.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year.
Most of the emigrants and emigrants are Estonian citizens, but more are among those who leave.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens with 2000 people was minus last year.
Estonians mostly migrate between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture princess fashion fascinates with sacks, embroidery and tulle
However, there is history for Maria Tammeoru in the bottomless idea ceiling - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, then you will study and learn more about it every day.
This is the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may appear to some unfamiliar, but the designer does not think so.
You decide how much shine you have in your life!
I have a girlfriend who has a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses that I created.
Because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go on a red carpet every day, he also wants to wear these most beautiful dresses and wears them!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and grey everyday life.
It was this idea that the plan was to move high-level fashion to rural areas, forests and fields in Estonia, to people who often did not reach fashion.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion alley, where 45 models filled the royal detail across the street.
In Tallinn, the pose is often taken in, anouncing is dignified, but elsewhere the emotions are more - shouting bravo, standing up, want to thank you.
Much of the audience came to see, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed the expectations of people, they will be amazed!
And I like the feeling that I am on a summer tour with my fashion creation.
In Pärnu we had a 50 metre long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed that they did not come to the end!
Maria also does not admit that her work must be presented by a supermodel, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my clients to the stage - they are always happy.
After all, it is such a bountiful experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I am so sorry that I have never seen my performance myself, I am always behind the stage to give the last touch to things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve would not allow you to look from the hall calmly.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who does not only want to fulfill the role of representation, but to be in everything by hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I carry out myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I’m never far from my creation and I’m not afraid of work.
Design is not limited to stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything must fit into one temperamental woman's day.
It is not these hours of work that fanatics still come enormously.
I can’t say when my workday ends, for me it’s just a day full of joy!
I’m still very lucky - it’s like an unceasing chain of happiness: I’m doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and in turn compliments.
Many times it has been said that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The tulle satire that made Maria the talent famous overnight remains the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp from U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian subgroup was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing we noticed was that we didn’t get to our table.
And when such a big difference comes in at the table, there is nothing to do", commented on the UK under U18 basketball boys 61:75 the only basketball player to play in the NBA, Martin Müürsepp, assistant coach of BC Kalev/Cramo.
Opponents took 28 balls from the offensive table and got so many more attacks as a result.
We were also not ready for their aggressive protection or attack, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we could not build up the defense.
In protection, however, they managed to keep hands in between everywhere, we could not combine.
It created the team's feet from the bottom.
Homework for opponents was better done.
According to the masonry, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take down the impetus of opponents.
Last quarter - we had zero mistakes, but opponents already received several quick baskets.
The athleticism and the fierce appeal that was our weapon in the subgroup tournament now turned all against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggressiveness.
The masonry was satisfied with Matthias Tassi in Kalev, Estonia.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, to this day there was a single kick fist.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent was not already met before.
The dish has always been self-confident and played out today in her field, but it seemed that she was tired - she has carried a pretty big load.
But he made a handful of beautiful movements that I’ve seen before working out", added a tutor.
Terrible Numbers: The women's basketball team scored less than 10 points in an EM tournament with three quarters...
In the U18 age group, only the youth championship B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn started in Dublin yesterday.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, tended to be an area of anti-cords.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, 9:49, or it was only in the last ten minutes that the opponents took their foot from the accelerator pedal, and that period was a little 16:16.
On both the first and second quarters, Estonia threw 4, the third 1 point...
At the beginning of the two minutes, the Estonians scored two pieces of the first four throws, and then 25 pieces past the game, then one in three and then 21 more throws along the way...
Perhaps one of the 47 throws were caught in almost half an hour.
In addition, there were 2 points out of four free throws.
There was a reasonable number of ball losses during this time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had a fair share of 33 and Estonia had 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day came to recognize the improvement of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish stock
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent mine control group arrived at Tallinn on a scheduled port visit for the weekend in order to replenish the ship’s stores and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, ships prepare to return to the sea and provide the crew with an opportunity for a couple of days' leave.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future operations in the search for historical explosives.
The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation training carried out by them in local waters illustrate our integration with the allied forces, said the Commander of the Operating and Planning Department of the Navy’s Chief of Mission, Manager of the Operation and Planning Department, Arto Reinmaa.
As of 29 June, Latvian Navy captain Gvido Laudups will be the leader of NATO's 1st permanent mine defence group, who took over the tasks of the group commander in Riga from the Estonian Navy officer captain Johan-Elias Seljamaa.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsatis, which also has the lead stage of the group.
This half-year, the international unit also includes the Estonian naval mine hunter Sakala.
As one of the four ships under the NATO Marine Commands, NATO's 1st permanent mine control group is a readiness unit among the primary rapid responders, which may be sent by the alliance to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita Convent will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, launched by Maestro Eri Klas 13 years ago, will be regarded as a place.
According to Risto Joosti, the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic Society, (36) this year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: From the opera world classics "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet performances from the enchanting "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson", there is also no self-production of the program, which this time is the performance of the wonderful "Seasons" of Joseph Haydn by the same international creative team who in 2015 brought Haydn’s second masterpiece to the stage in Pirita.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It is larger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It’s a festival that takes power and never lets go.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this exalted and mysterious environment makes the human souls ring and touches human perceptions in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Did the maestro Different Class shoes not seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of the conducting career.
Perhaps this makes it easier for me to continue my work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the team of Birgitta Festival and, of course, it also transfers to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how to do things.
It was the great heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to go on with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic Society.
And here I am and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year’s festival, what are you offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and as a surprise, among other things, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren’s narrative comes to the presentation.
To do this, "Karlsson flies".
And one of the curious nuances is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a wish to write this work.
Apparently, she has already lived in her soul since she was a child with the character of Karlsson.
Risto, how do you do it all?
Surely thanks to my supporting partner.
Such work needs a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have a pile.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as I am, perhaps how I will meet every new day.
And such conscious keeping the tone, maintaining the positivity and actually smiling yourself in the mirror in the morning, greatly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important samples, I have practiced it especially from afar and it works.
smiling activates the brain and increases tone.
It’s not just a eloquence.
I think people still do not know the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but each one discovers this gradually.
Right away, an important moment is here.
Do you have any ritual before joining the remote of the conductor?
It is still, the clothes have to be replaced with more comfortable ones.
This is a small moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don’t have the opportunity to rest before a big show or make a little nap.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before I step on the remote.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here is what not a very big opera and ballet friend to discover!
Watch a fun video with Risto Joost!
New results of Swedish asylum seeker age assessment tests published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers, during which their age was assessed with a new approach medically.The newest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the tested were evaluated older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing at the beginning of this year.
The tests were designed to assess age more precisely in the course of asylum applications after the Swedish Migrationsverket (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of alleged minor refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing, and the Institute of Judicial Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid March 2017 and July 31st.
Eighty percent (2002) were 18 years or older, and in 25 other cases, the Court Medicine Institute assessed that the tested "may be 18 years or older".
432 in the case, it was concluded that the person is "presumably younger than 18".
The tests are only used if the person’s age is under the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Judicial Medicine, the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
We can’t see a big difference compared to previous month’s statistics, the numbers are quite consistent,” he said to The Local.
The fact that much of the cases were evaluated older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 test results in May and said that 442 "there are indications that the person to be examined is 18 years or older".
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that, in 243 cases, the person had directly claimed that he would receive 18 this year.
This method of medical age assessment, during which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT of knee joints are taken, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, are criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute Claude Marcus, whose tasks include assessing the biological maturity of people to find out whether they passed puberty earlier or later.
I have had reason to think about it and I do not think that the method of measurement I use now.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say for sure, we shouldn’t make a face that we can,” he said to the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Judicial Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of dissolving the child incorrectly as an adult is low.
The biggest, i.e. at about 10%, is the risk if a person is a little less than 18."

The 20-year-old hammer launcher, Anna Maria Orel, made a beautiful debut at the MIL London, taking the 18th place with 67.37.
The organ was the youngest female hammer thrower in MM, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80), I immediately made my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much, and the third (67.37) I managed to keep my head clear", Orel said after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions and I am very pleased that I found it.
Anna Maria Orel’s debut ended with a good 18th place.
Rainy Organ was not disturbed because it trains the winter through the TUT stadium.
"I'm toughened", he said with a little puddle.
At the London Olympic Stadium, there was almost a full house of people, did Orel perceive people around them or could they turn off?
I perceived, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it gives more - that's it!
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he was satisfied with the World Championship debut and is still looking for a lot of good competitions: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I am 20 years old and MMil - this is the only one that counts.
I take along a good experience and some days I want to compete already for medals.
Western Virginia Governor Announced a Party Exchange
Governor Jim Justice of the Western Virginia Democrats announced on Thursday evening gathering with President Trump that he was changing parties.
"Like it or not, but the democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today, I say to you, having prayed a lot and thought about it... today, I say to you, to the Western Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
The gathering was preoccupied with joyousness.
So I will become a republican tomorrow," Justice added.
As a coach, I would tell you that time is to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a big announcement in the gathering of West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, turned out to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and that he owns coal business from his father.
Its value is approximately $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of Republicans (RNC) announced on Thursday night that "the party change of governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would rather prevent the country from getting better than working for it."
"Just 15 governorships and control over the lowest number of states in history - the Governor Justice announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is run from the end to the end and is unable to find a positive and connecting message," said RNC chair Ronna McDaniel in CBS News.
It is no surprise that where there are many people, there are also many injured.
Urmet, who was in charge of the medical tent on Weekend, told Õhtuleht yesterday that they had to divide out quite a lot of patches.
The blisters and abrasions are basic, twisting out and slight falls.
Of course, head, back and foot pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with wrong shoes and so the problems come.
Medics have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also made stitches when a person has smashed a hand or a finger.
We do smaller seams here, we send larger ones to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if festive treats for a hangover also ask for an analgesic.
Coe praised the honest apology of the Russians for the doping scandal
According to her words, the international nostrilist Sebastian Coe praised the "Russian Thursday honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it is not time to allow the country to return sports now.
The Russian athletics nostrilist Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s ban on competitions is correct and has a firm goal to fight doping.
He apologised for "all athleticsmen from whom gold and silver medals in competitions have been knocked off".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban on competition introduced in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
Today, I think it was a very honest answer, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to journalists.
"The whole council and the entire Congress were satisfied that the Russian federation itself recognized that they had quite difficult times and they do everything possible to reorganise the federation."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted its own restoration criteria.
I believe that today was a very constructive day and there is progress, but the congress supports the group proposal that now is not the right time to withdraw from Russia," said Coe.
We must do everything possible within the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always proceeded from the principle that we want clean athletes to separate from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletics, meeting the IAAF’s strict criteria, compete as neutral athletes to the world athletics that begin in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, the IAAF team leader, said on Monday that Russia would not yet meet several restoration criteria.
Following a presentation by the IAAF Council, he told the journalists in London that the doping check was still insufficient and that the banned coaches still operate freely.
The electric car revolution significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution significantly change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they win from one place and lose from another, smaller mining companies do not help.
At present, Glencore serves coal and oil, but in the future in the era of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand will increase.
This year, betting on the spread of electric cars has increased the decisions of the United Kingdom, France and the Norwegian governments, which will allow in the coming decades to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels.
That’s why Volvo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the combustion engine and Tesla is launching a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, electric cars have been sold for more than two decades.
For some metals, it changes everything," said Simona Gambranini Bloomberg, a raw analyst at Capital Economics.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has been growing for many years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore reported.
Even more copper is needed at the charging stations, which is why according to Exane BNP Paribas, it will increase the copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in the demand for electric car batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore receives revenue from the rising trend of electric cars from the copper price increase and is the world’s largest cobalt producer, predicted by Jefferies Group.
According to this brokerage company, the other winners of the triumph of electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, London’s metal exchange has cost more than 70 per cent.
Last year’s price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also increased by 14 per cent this year, mainly due to growth.
The share of Glencore increased by 20 percent in London, having surpassed Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton, and Anglo American as a price increase.
On the side of the losers, lead-driven companies like Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is batteries supplying starters with petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless other purpose is found to exceed demand drop", said Michael Widmer, Metal Market Analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The price movement of the lead does not yet notice the impact of the unfolding trend.
Lead has risen by 17 per cent this year, with the best metal in London, among the main industrial metals.
Investors will only see problems with metal in the distant future.
I’m not sure that it’s so bad to lead because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive,” said the sales manager of the metal broker firm Triland Metals, Herwig Schmidt.
If the lead's demand falls, it happens slowly.
It may happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, higher exhaust emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars will increase, depending on lead-based batteries developed during the most frequent start-up of engines, will be assessed by an international lead and zinc research organization.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel, as lighter cars can drive further with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand for 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the total production of the aluminum world.
Probably this trend deepens, said Widmer.
Aluminium has seen an increase of 13 per cent this year, as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
The steel manufacturers do not sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce lightweight car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also striving to develop lighter alloy steel to resist aluminium.
The "high-strength steel should be the answer to this development", said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
Some successes can be seen in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this metal diesel engine was used for automotive catalysts, the metal refiner Johnson Matthew reported.
"Many raw materials currently in high demand such as oil and platinum may not have high demand in the future", said Bernard Dahdah, a raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that the raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grünberg, director of Uncore, said that in 2025, more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from all-electric vehicles.
In 10 years, Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos have been developed for hydrogen-based cars that depend on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not justified itself commercially.
The diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars,” said Exane BNP from Paribas Brunet.
In July, German car manufacturers became a party to a major setback, as the Stuttgart court forbade the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules designed to prevent the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar’s world record transition from the Spanish football club to the French club Paris-Saint Germain in Barcelona.
With any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game, and the power of which to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris is just waiting for Saint-Germain.
The ‘Fair Play Financial Rules’ (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 means that PSG has to prove at some point that Neymar’s transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar’s salary starts to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of going to a club in Neymar France.
PSG is undoubtedly able to withdraw such money to recruit Neymar and add it to its star-rich lineup, given that the team is funded by a family of Qatar’s wealth of energy.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot on recruiting players, but they must balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of their own in the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platin after being elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that are in search of success in large debts are actually dealing with cheating and risk spreading if banks or owners should give up support.
Since 2011, FFP focuses on monitoring their losses instead of club debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then make great expenses to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of the FFP, which will last until 2018, clubs may incur losses of up to €30 million.
And despite being disgraced by the presidential office in 2015, his UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
FFP is definitely not dead, and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said Andrea Traverso, who is the FFP supervisor in UEFA last week for The Associated Press.
Although PSG paid for Neymar’s over-purchase clause as a single payment, it is possible for them to split that amount into instalments for accounting purposes throughout the contract’s term.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract, which is why it is possible to show the transitional fee in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the next five years.
In the case of the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi, received the worst punishments for the neck.
PSG was fined €60 million (at that point, $82 million), which was subsequently reduced to €20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 in the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to overwhelm regulatory financial institutions by blowing their earnings through its owners-related companies.
A Qatar company may sponsor a PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, then UEFA would not allow it to be considered as official income.
This happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support was upblown.
It has been said that some of Neymari PSG’s service may come from Qatar through the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee payments.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador to the World Cup and claim that the regulators of UEFA would be able to easily reveal such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not proactively discussed the transition of Neymar with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is ensured as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The most recently published reports show that PSG earned more than EUR 10 million in profit for the 2015-2016 season at the turnover of approximately EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects at least 30 percent increase in turnover due to the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, being clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, sought to prevent Neymar's transition, claiming that PSG was thus breaking FFP.
This is a clear case of "money doping" with the club and the state," said President of La Liga Javier Tebas of Spain to the newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares the attitude that the state finances the club.
This is the consequence of ownership and has completely changed the whole football landscape over the past 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player in the country."
Norwegian low cost airlines have a nice tradition of placing pictures of those who have pushed boundaries in their own field and had been inspired by others, writes at trip.ee
Together with the expansion of the Norwegian operating geography, the circle of people who have earned a place on the plane wedge has also expanded.
Among the selected individuals are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, a portrait of Queen’s legendary singer Freddie Mercury begins to decorate a plane.
Today 50 years ago: a hurricane storm in Estonia that rips roofs and windows from houses.
A hurricane called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage, especially to Lääne County, Harju County and Rapla County.
During these days, the wind speed in north-western Estonia was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one arched tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and tragic, like the end of the world.
In addition, the old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu reminded the magazine Eesti Loodus in 2002 about the roofs of the houses.
Linda’s husband saw how her garden collapsed.
But what do you still support trees with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, the water splashed into the windows," said Mrs Linda who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu.
The roads were full of trees, and the roof of the train station apron had been 20-30 metres away, Linda saw most of the people of Haapsalu just like it was the next morning.
According to locals, behind Paralepa, the trees were on the ground, some were completely lying down, some were half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees as a rag and a cracker like a war.
Lääne-Viru County could not be particularly severely damaged in August 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were also high, Virumaa Teataja was written in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped off the ground, but also our own parks were severely damaged.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured up to 35 metres per second, i.e. approximately 130 kilometres per hour.
On the evening of 6 August at the Tallinn Maritime Square, a tiny pulley had exclaimed, "Mother, mother!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be downloaded!", wrote Virumaa Teataja.
The Pilli manor building, located in Viljandi County, was destroyed during the storm so that it was decided to be demolished later.
The constructions of the Türi ski jump hill that were no longer restored later did not withstand the August storm.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on 12 August 1967 that cleaning cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches is slowly progressing, and residents could be involved in cleaning work.
In the storm grain fields were also severely damaged, and the newspaper stated that "participation organisations must be inspiring and guiding both in the work of organisation and in the harvesting process".
You can talk about hurricanes if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of gust wind in Estonia will last from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu had a wind speed of 48 m/s.
On the island of Vaindloo, the measuring tool broke, so the speed of strong winds measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Cold summer weather also means a smaller cleaning effort on the beaches of Tallinn.
If there is no, there are people on the beach, and if there are no, there are also no people", the beach cleaner says.
The North Tallinn Stroomi beach is surrounded by gulls.
They are offered melodic competition at low revs by a swinging tractor that drops streaks on the planer.
In fact, the last seven centimetres deep sift through the sand, picking out marine litter and the rest left behind by people: bottle caps, cigarette butts and more.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, Head of Beach Cleaning at Haabersti.
The time is 6.30am and there is a bitter cleaning on the beach, because the square must be fine for people at eightam.
Usov has been working at four o’clock.
In addition to Stroomi, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku lake, Kakumäe and Paljassaare Pikakari beach.
The amount of waste has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People are already able to appreciate what is being done for them", says Usov, who has cleaned the beaches for 15 years.
Before it was that when something new was erected, it was already broken the next day.
Now what is on the beach is already kept.
Clean Beach Price
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea litter, i.e. ploughs, washed on the shore.
For example, at Pirita beach, it must be transported 400 000 tonnes after the beach season.
"It's an incredible quantity", notes Usov.
Another large category is household waste, i.e. everything that people leave behind.
There are eight large waste containers on a one-and-a-half kilometre Stroomi beach that need to be emptied three times a week.
There will be so much garbage.
However, the colder summer weather has meant that the garbage is one fifth less than otherwise.
Third species form abandoned things.
In most cases, they are children's toys.
As a prey for this time, Usov has scooped ten model cars out of the sand.
They remain on the wooden road leading to the beach.
Usually more of them come out, but it is a normal harvest".Usov already knows that soon he will find them again inside the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Garbage is torn apart
Erika Scholler, the administrative services representative of Haabersti, acknowledges that the extraction of the tractor interferes with local operations.
The noise that lasts from night hours to early in the morning mixes the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
However, during the day, this work is impossible.
One month the beach has to be sifted twice.
If we don’t, then the district will fine us,” says Scholler.
But the goal is to get Stroomi beach under the international Blue Flag quality mark, just like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu.
Compared to Europe, there is a lot more work in Estonia to have the beaches maintained,” says Scholler.
We have more curbs and stones and harder to sift sand.
However, there is less waste on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that waste is being talked about on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, unforcedly takes the conversation between journalist and cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
In the mornings, there is an image of the squirrel everywhere.
The problem is with birds and bottle pickers who have pulled garbage bags inside out", Martin says.
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their current habits, Martin hopes that the city government will do something with trash and, for example, put on lids to prevent at least birds from exploring there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroomi beach.
You can see that the city takes care of it.
With children's squares, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It was once that the roller skates could only drive one way", notes Martin.
Treasure hunter finds in Stroomi: coins, only coins
A 40-year-old Dimitri has come to use as a treasure hunter on the beach edge with a metal detector.
He does not believe that today or in the future something precious will find.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough to do so.
"I've been doing this for the year and haven't found anything valuable so far", says Dmitri.
As a hobby treasure hunter, Dmitri treasure bag has some euro coins, bottle caps and even dangerous pounds that later throws the trash.
Usually, there are still coins.
The "gold, rings and so much more usually do not exist", bears treasure hunter.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The announcement by the Bank of England that interest rates remain at their former level, as weak growth and easing inflation have cushioned speculation on the rise.
Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain weak, as the revenues stamped by households have put interest rates on hold.
The policy makers of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted in favour of holding at 6:2 rates of 0.25% and fewer members call for an increase this month as slow growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced the 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and in 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household income remained, as inflation was still expected to rise close to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank also pointed out that the increase in rates was necessary to curb inflation from Brexit over the next few years, and financial markets may need to increase their loan costs as expected.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was launched as a result of Brexit a year ago.
The bank will end in February with a fixed-term funding scheme that offers low-cost funding to banks, although it now said it is expected to receive a bid of £15 billion, £115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision made on the rate, the bank says: "The gross domestic product (GDP) in the middle forecast of the MPC remains unaffected in the near future, as the difficult situation in the real incomes of households will continue to have an impact on consumption."
They reiterated the need for some tighten monetary policy to ease inflation, to the extent that they were expected in the markets.
The stock exchange is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that all kinds of jumps are scheduled and limited.
The bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next are comparable to May’s forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for the 1.8-percent increase of 2018 remained.
After this news, the exchange rate of the pound fell to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators that have dampened growing hopes regarding the rise  GDP increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to gain some momentum.
The bank’s latest inflation report, which gave little reason to delight households with rising inflation and merciless wage rises, saying that the situation will be a little worse before the improvement.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent income strikes in the next few years, but a significant recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
As a result of weak pounds, the economy is also stimulated by rising demand for British produce, which partially compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision comes one year after the rates were transferred to the EU referendum shocking by 0.25% in August, leading to a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the bank, it is likely that it will take four years to bring full life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for raising the rate, as inflation had increased pressures on narrow households; in July, three policy makers demanded an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although in the bank’s words it was expected and a rise is expected again in the coming months.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2-percent goal was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Chief Mortgage Officer at Coreco, said: "In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to become more competitive again as lenders crave to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly advantageous to those whose current transactions begin to be completed because refinancing, often free of commission and at a low rate, has become more and more popular."
NHS is writing an HIV drug that causes 10 000 people into conflict
Patients have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment since September after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the drug.
NHS England announced that public health will now make a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) available to an estimated 10 000 people during the initial three-year clinical test - a pill administered before intercourse, which has shown a decrease of approximately 86% in the risk of infection in the case of high-risk people.
The NHS agreed to finance the clinical trial after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS is able to pay for the PreEP, despite the institution’s own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, the CEO of NHS England, welcomed this Thursday launch as a "new extensive intervention", while the National Aids Fund (NAT) described it as a "spinning moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register, and in October there will be more clinics available before the programme will be launched anywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medication that is taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people with risk of infection.
Taking PreEP before intercourse means that there are a sufficient amount of drugs in the human body that prevent HIV from being infected.
Such medications can be taken daily or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Suitable candidates include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
The clinics identify suitable people who agree to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-related partner does not receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in the local health clinic participating in the program.
The program costs £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on who the drug is intended and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new wide-ranging intervention should complement and amplify the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the fight against one of the greatest health problems of humanity in more than three decades."
Deborah Gold, the CEO of NAT, said, "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted correctly for those who need it and are part of a risk group, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high-risk HIV in England have access through this NHS-funded clinical trial to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and independent of negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now it is essential to ensure that the clinical trial is swiftly pushed over the country and that none of the people in the HIV risk group is left behind.
Now that the PreEP clinical trial drug is procured, we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Public Health, said: "The beginning of the PreEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and dragging the government legs.
Evidence shows how significant changes this medicine can bring to HIV prevention and its life-changing spread.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PreEP.
Now it is important that the clinical trial is deployed as soon as possible in order to protect people with exposure to HIV and to take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania the price fell.
In July, the difference between the exchange price of electricity on the next day decreased to EUR 1.94 compared to EUR 7.71 this June, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
The average exchange price of electricity in Estonia was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month, and the price increased 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price of the power exchange Nord Pool was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven per cent respectively.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Finland for 75 per cent of the previous month’s hours towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place on the next day.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia 99 per cent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 per cent of the hours used all transmission capacity.
According to transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the exchange price of electricity may be approximately 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price of electricity rose last month and the transactions took place at EUR 5.04-5.47 per tonne.
Living high life - the semi-storey and clever design tips have made this small Earls Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, swapped his large Knightsbridge home for Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
Before that, I lived with my former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," said Joanne.
I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.”
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - to get to the bedroom had to be walked through the kitchen, Joanne wanted to add storage space and a half floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
They were my demands," he said.
He hired the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed at Erfan Azadi Notting Hill to take advantage of 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that wouldn’t simply be a development site, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-story where you can stand up.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would be located on top of each other without having to bow down.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but we used a steel structure to ensure that the height of both the upper and lower rooms is correct."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms with numerous elements.
The semi-story opens from the old-fashioned copper-light Retrovius window to the glamorous living area below the view.
Golden furniture with mirrored surface, silver details and the retro-flammable Serge Mouille luminaire underline the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatricality, spatiality and light saturation.
At both ends of the short corridor there are added mirrors to make it look longer.
The kitchen creates the impression of a window opening in the second room with a mirror.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet provides a storage space for all Joanne cutlery and glassware.
The living room is complemented by the possibility of closing the kitchen part if it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, this kitchen is a unique fact that it is a garage-type retractable door.
A bit of design effort went into it," Erfan explains the steel reinforcement veneered MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, so it glides very easily when pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
After all, the floor surface is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," says Erfan.
"A real estate agent enters an outdated form of room and performs calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor space by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
The materials are what you touch and thus help to make an emotional connection with your home," says Erfan.
You do not fall in love with the electrical wiring in the wall.
This is important, but does not make heart tongues ringing."
This shows that a good design and an increase in the area will help to make quite an amazing thing about an ordinary apartment.
In fact, they can even create a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago skyscraper headhunter who competes with a colleague for promotion.
There is no other than the amount of money that has been earned, with the exception of which any ethics is forgotten.
A man sees his wife and three children only in early morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that it is a version of the business world of "Card House" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech-manager are similar.
The further the film, the less frame-based element remains, and the moralising intent of the filmmakers begins to stand out more and more.
For life-changing experience, the head character becomes a son's illness.
Now you need to make a choice between working and family life.
A son dreaming of the office of architecture makes his father think about really important things like faith, kindness, love, even the catastrophe of the twin towers on the big buildings of Chicago.
After the third scene, where the son opens his eyes, it feels that the filmmakers have been guided by the goal of making sure to cry out, because even the most lucid-hearted viewer can't keep tears back seeing the suffering of a cute cancer patient boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, his father can fully understand the morality of his work and does a good deed for the old man looking for work.
Now I bet with myself in the sense - if the film has happy itself, I will reward my vision after the film with coffee, but if I’m wrong, then at least one surprise can be praised from the screenwriter.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that you miss out on the coffee - when your husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes towards the floor of the corridor in slow motion.
However, the son has healed wonderfully, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now is time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can predict the end of American drama quite well!
In giving the truth, the film is well designed, all the necessary elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals beautiful: money is not the most important in life.
Probably this film brings in well.
Trump’s new HR manager plans to limit President’s media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
In this case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new head of staff at the White House plans to limit the flow of information that President Trump receives, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss more flattering in the water.
Here is an excerpt reporter from Josh Dawsey:
When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Human Resources at the White House, met with high officials on his first working day, he pointed out a key issue in President Donald Trump’s White House, which he planned to solve  the arrival of bad information in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through him, either on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he were to be shared with good information.”
Kelly's diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have tried it too and they have failed to taming Trump with monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with the TV network dates back decades, and even now he is in the White House, his television viewing habits have not disappeared anywhere.
If the candidate Trump was annoyed about the unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also honestly reflected in the publications that affected him," said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign advisor in February to Politico.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that, “at the time, according to six former campaigners, Trump’s key to managing Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption consistently includes praises”.
Good though.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter usage habits have ever been under control is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign staff know something that the rest of us don’t know  that Trump’s tweets would have been even more flaming without their intervention.
We probably never learn about Tweets that Trump did not post.
When his assistants were able to save him from the mischief even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from continual controversy.
Some of the problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, people try to promote their own interests exclusively by transmitting to Trump material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be trustworthy.
In May, Politico, reflecting the entire course of the story, wrote about the propensity of advisors to feed the president in advance of the strategically questionable value.
One of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump can respond to negative press, especially harmful information leaks, explosively, with the obsession of identifying their source source.
This was also the case at the end of February, when someone gave a copy of the article on the website GotNews.com, owned by Charles C. Johnson, who blamed the staff manager Katie Walshi for being the "source of a number of information leaks" in the White House.
It does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter due to a misunderstanding, or that he did not provide any specific evidence, or that he has also made and withdrawn false accusations in the past.
Trump read the article and began inheriting Walsh from the subordinates."
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus and Rob Porter, head of the White House Chancellery, "has tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trump."
How did it succeed?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he turns out to be a more efficient driver of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants still compete for impact.
These changeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad who have come to the capital do not get permission to perform bitterly.
In the centre of Tallinn, a lot of foreigners are playing music.
Those with whom Õhtuleht was told admitted to playing in the old town without the permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians from near the Viru Gates who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with equestrian and cleft clothes were backpackers who would take one shower away from the berries.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while one man juggled with three balls next to him and called passers closer.
The third man had sat on one backpack next to them and smoked his own ready-turned pygmy in peace of mind.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to disturb the passing people.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noem and juggled with the balls, told him that they were playing on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the existence of the company was to collect ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the evening of the same day.
When asked whether they asked the city for a permit to play music in the old town, Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads.
First of all, we did not know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and in most cases permissions are granted for a month or something like that.
There is no point in paying for it", explained Bob.
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with musicians and drive them away.
The group moved to the Viru Keskus shopping centre with backpacks and dogs to touch their luck.
There were also three Polish young people on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other the clarinet, and the third had even carried the electronic piano.
We are here to provide people with entertainment to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living," explained trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the government’s permission to perform must be.
Of course we don't have it", he said in the fun.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased bonds for €149 million under the euro area central banks’ public sector asset purchase programme in July, with a total increase of €4.36 billion in the central bank’s bond portfolio.
The central bank does not disclose more detailed information about purchases.
Hardo Hansson, Governor of Eesti Pank, has previously explained, in response to the interpellation of the members of the Riigikogu, that the Eurosystem’s central bank purchase programme includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds of the financial sector (covered bonds), covered bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases result in lower-risk assets yielding, and this motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a rule, under the public sector bond purchase programme, each central bank purchases government bonds of its own country, and no bonds of other countries are purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the amount allocated to them.
Central banks also make replacement purchases in countries where the offering of bonds corresponding to the purchase programme is limited.
Eesti Pank generally buys the bonds of the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank, according to Hansson.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme starting from March 2015.
Meanwhile, Elering’s bonds were also acquired, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering’s bonds from June 2016.
Since June, on behalf of the euro area central banks, both Elering and Eesti Energia will purchase bonds of the Finnish central bank.
The travelers ignore the trench and return to the "millionaires' district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of West Midlands have again entered a furious confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the dug ditch of the council to win back the field away from their villas.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans near Solihull Street, which was baptized as a prosperous "millionaire district".
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks after they were only kicked out in May without having to mix themselves from the ditch, which was dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak place within the boundaries of protection, squeezing their vehicles through the unblocked part left as a footpath.
The furious residents have been afflicted by the Solihull Council, saying that the council is "useless to deal with the problem".
One anonymous inhabitant said: "They moved there on Monday evening after their foreclosure from Bentley Heath, where they looped passers-by with stones.
The Council must be disgraced to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they are back again.
They came to last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on the way to Streetsbrook and I am not satisfied that I have to continue paying municipal council tax if the council is not even able to prevent such a thing."
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said, "This is ridiculous; only we saw the latter leaving these travelers, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time, the number has increased, and even the horse has been seen remembering in grassland."
The representative of the Solihull council said: "We are aware that there is an unauthorised campsite in the country near Streetsbrook Road, and we work with the Solihull Police to implement the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
Taking evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture for the court when we present the case to them."
Indrek Saar, the Minister of Culture, is also visiting the Weekend Festival, who is glad that the top names of the world have been brought to Estonia.
The island answers the question of why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians that it should be asked from all those who enjoy the festival three days’ talk fully.
However, he admits that real people in their field have come to Pärnu.
Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, it is said that the absolute top names of this genre of music are brought home - it often does not happen in our possession", says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists present at the festival but do the most speak to Saart?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for those like me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
After all, according to his disc spin, all of us have twisted their feet themselves at some point," he says.
However, he brings out several other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers: starting with NOËP and they can be read in a whole line.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high," he says.

Audi innovates car manufacturers in the middle of criticism of up to 850 000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it was offering a software upgrade for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the BMW Chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the hometown of BMW, Munich, which has weighed on banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these actions as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been keen to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, for automotive companies, the cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise exhaust emissions emitted by diesel vehicles increases, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, the Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is accused of pampering the powerful car manufacturers and of violating the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to prevent Volkswagen from repeating errors, which were silent about the use of scam devices, which allowed the exhaust gas reading to be adjusted to fit the car during testing, but retracted under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic investigation.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former President, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may be sued in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation concerning Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused Audit of installing the system in order to evade the requirements of European exhaust emissions, thereby extending the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Involving an audit into the investigation can be a huge boost for Volkswagen  luxury manufacturer generates a disproportionately large part of Volkswagen’s profit.
The European Union flags are purchased for Estonian schools for EUR 20 000.
By 1 September, the Ministry of Education plans to buy the European Union flags to mark the residency for schools in Estonia.
A total of 105x158 centimeters of the European Union flag 570 educational institutions.
The flags are intended to be exhibited indoors, they must also be performed in high-quality printing technology indoors with a tunnel mount, the ERR news portal mediates.
The flagpole label contains the text: "A gift for Estonian schools to mark the first Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
According to the Ministry of Education, the estimated cost of 570 flags is 20 000 euros, i.e. one flag will cost 35 euros.
The murder of the journalist emphasizes the growing threat situation in Mexico
The employees of the weeksheet Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which is sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceasing drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two older writers discuss which seems safer: either bring children to their office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to name each column  no evidence is needed, it is enough to impress and feel inside.
When being hired by government or cartels, drug traders, politicians, businessmen, and journalists are suspected of having  a whole list of bad guys who make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the more dead bodies accumulate in the country, the greater the number of journalists  Since the adoption of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25 589 journalists have been subjected to state protection after attacks and threats, and seven journalists have yet to die during this year in seven states.
Recent deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, the co-founder of Riodoce Javier Valdez Cardenas.
The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives him a deep feeling, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the  Riodoce building hangs a large picture of Valdez showing his middle finger with the letter "Righteality", and in the 30s the two reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his face with smiling glasses or his characteristic panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death.The reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although in 2010 a separate public prosecutor’s office was created for handling the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been held liable to the court.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, the number of which reaches thousands, journalists rarely come to court.
The editors of Riodoce continue to reflect violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and fairness of murderers, Ibarra says that there is a lot of benefit from a meeting on security.
"It is very silly to waste your time here at the meeting," he says.
"As long as the cause is unknown, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the office of Riodoce in Culiacan, the capital of the state on the morning of 15 May.
He only managed to drive a few quarters before two men stopped by his red Toyota Corolla, forced him to leave the car and fired 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "the twelfth river" translated.
The armed man drove Valdez into the car and made an accident nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
Rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
However, only silence prevails mainly on the subject of Valdez.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the release of the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival clicks are fighting for filling the power vacuum.
It does not matter that a few people or even several people are released on Sinaloa’s streets every day, or that the cemetery is swarmed by the richly decorated mausoleums of the double drug kings, which are larger than many living homes.
Let us forget that peacetime refers to the fact that only one cartel leads the state of the sea with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers involved in his work, the co-founder and director of Riodoce Ismail Bojorquez (60) knows the immense consciences that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first of them was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a cartel competing with the sons of Guzman, and a cartel on the war leg.
This piece of writing could anger the sons  suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived at the newspapers booths.
Another mistake was that Valdezi was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the raid on another newspaper editorial that featured the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been alive so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he was always there.
He worked as a veteran reporter at Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce by selling $50 units.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa, "it was impossible to deal with press without having to touch the drug issue".
Over time, the newspaper gained recognition and sales and advertising with its bold and honest reflections.
The reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers fascinated by the publication, from which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, the Valdez Committee on the Protection of Journalists (ACP) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow Mexican drug science wherever it takes.
He honestly admitted that he was afraid.
I want to live on," he said when accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he told the TV show Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking was a lifestyle in Sinaloa.
You need to embrace the task that comes with the journalist’s office  another way is to fool yourself.
I don’t want to be asked what I did when faced with so many deaths, or why I didn’t say what’s going on.”
The Riodoce collective longs for Valdez, a joker who roped like a sailor, a friend who shared kind embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar across the road and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also made them doubt about how to do their job best and stay alive.
They don’t like it when you mess with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used for drug transportation.”
"These things should not be touched," said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-maintenance even in the best times.
Trusting your instincts.
If the thing smells suspicious, keep away.
According to Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and so it happened to Javier."
He and others say that old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero or other states, which are home to a toxic combination of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees gathered for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that it was revealed that only the spyware sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers looked for relief in the shade of the tree from 40 degrees of heat.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters pondered in half-pleasing whether these police officers were among those 50 percent of the policemen whose governor himself had stamped as unreliable.
Several months have passed since the reporters have traveled to mountainous countryside, where the inspection is in the hands of de facto drugs.
The Riodoce edition of this week dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the former box legend, Julio Cesar Chavez's brother, in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story of spending government funds on the Governor’s home town.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was abducted or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city  restaurant is a favourite place for both drug traders and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician belonging to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the previous century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of extensive coverage of cases in corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of El Chapo, had escaped the military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for a column in Valdez to learn about kidnapping from the best sources.
We had already known what happened before," said Villarreal, aged 46, whose genius body building has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels have been interrupted by our sources."
Valdez’s office has become a storage room for labels and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and the editors have received something they could never expect  activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of labels and headed to the local prosecutor’s office next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after killing Valdez.
A dead body has been found and, according to officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal across the country and scribbling the phrase "SOS press" for pavements and buildings as organized protests.
On this day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to collect international support to establish justice for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez’s death, meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because of the truth.
After that he asked for him to be guided by the government’s activity from recognition elsewhere, worrying that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were “restricted” by organized crime, co-crime state officials, and indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug forces, but are also done by the command of politicians and security forces who are in a mess with organised crime.
The media monitoring group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of journalists’ attacks on the police and state officials last year.
In Mexico, you die because you want to be put in silence," Ramirez said.
Murders clearly have a blood-tharpening effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macas in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter to which the cartel Los Zetas had probably signed, "I'm here for my reportages."
Next to his cut-off head, a computer keyboard and headphones were lying.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after killing their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others pass on as did the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke drug cartels with the editorial "What do you want?" on the front cover.
Some journalists have fled home states or even the country.
It is a nerve-feeding decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find a job and they still have to peek into the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are driven back, as was probably the case with the photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered together with four women in a Mexico apartment in 2015, three months after they fled Veracruz.
Those who stay in place and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that reflecting a drug business frightens him.
"Mexico is on the way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
One recent Friday midnight, when the freshest number had already been locked, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and plundered the beer, when suddenly all the phones began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were killed in fire exchanges between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as many messages left by cartels found in the area promised.
From there on the side of the sidewalk, reporters put news on their mobile phone using Riodoce’s website.
The front cover of the next day needed to be changed.
The sirens swarmed along the  another fire exchange in the area.
Bojorquez peeked toward the policemen on duty to see if they are vigilant.
If they were afraid, they did not show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his average finger can be seen on the entire Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce carried out in his footsteps.
How could I think about closing at all," Bojorquez said, "when Javier was killed, a trainee asked him to report to the streets?"
Dinosaur used defensive color to prevent enemies
At first glance, it seems like a shape, although quite scary.
Researchers have now revealed the first findings in relation to the unbelievable rhinoceros of the Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that his armored skin was reddish-brown in color and his past had been somewhat "complex".
The report published in Current Biology described being as "the best-preserved armor ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur positions in the world".
Fossil is a new kind of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation boged researchers who describe it "truely significant".
This armored vegetarian is the best preserved type of fossil ever found according to the National Geographic magazine.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millennium mine in Fort McMurray near North Alberta in Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to examine more closely.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, the animal was developed to dig out 2500 pounds (1100 kilos) of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is finally ready to be made public.
If you squint a bit of eyes, you can almost believe that he is sleeping," said leading author Caleb Brown, researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the existence is exhibited.
It goes into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - dinosaurs Mona Lisa."
When studying his skin, researchers found that this plant eater, who are covered with scales and resembles a walking tank, was likely to be significantly endangered by meat-food dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with plenty of scales used a red and white protective color to hide from predators, and applied a shading technique called eclipse, which is also used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this allowed dinosaurs to blend better into the surroundings and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs probably hunted him.
This 110 million-year-old Nodosaurus family of being first arrived in the news of May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now explored the being and named it after the Borealopelta markmitchelli museum laboratory Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7000 hours exposing the animal to be difficult.
Thanks to its amazing preservation, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of scales on the body of the animal.
They discovered an eclipse - a common protection method in the animal country, which means that the upper part of the being was darker than the lower one.
Although the eclipse is common, finds come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals living today with eclipse.
It suggests that dinosaurs were hunted actively enough by other dinosaurs who were carnivore, that evolution preferred to hide instead of confrontation as survival tactics.
However, most modern-day eclipse animals, such as deer, zebra, or armadels, are much smaller and more vulnerable as a prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to really struggle to survive.
The powerful hunting of dinosaurs covered with enormous and large scales shows how dangerous predators could be from dinosaurs in the chalk age," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of scales also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal to get clues about its life, including its gut-preserved content, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that dinosaur died of a river, thereby reaching the stream to the sea, where he sank in front of the back of the ocean bottom.
At that time, Albertas was as warm as now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to go far beyond inland than now.
This nodosaurus is truly significant because it is completely covered with an armored skin, but it has also remained three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the chalk age.
It doesn’t have to be used a lot of imagination to reconstruct it – it is enough just to squeeze the eyes and it seems that it’s as if it’s asleep.”
The chalk age was the time when on Earth enormous dinosaurs - theoroshops, moving on two feet.
Although their all king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be hunted by some of his frightening predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons of weight monster.
Researchers whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology believe that Borealispelta was washed into the sea after death and it mummified in the mud.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk discovered Olev when he mined Millennium mine Fort McMurray near North Albertas in Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including the skin and scales, and it is a comprehensive cone up to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to £3000 (1300 kg).
Two 20 inches of ora broke out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored-covered planter ventured through the present western Canada until the flooded river slept in its open sea.
However, the underwater burial site of dinosaur helped to preserve its scales in a perfectly detailed way.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skulls of the giant armor plates along the dinosaur still cover the skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine: "This degree of preservation is as rare as the lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the noisy armor plates located on the skull.
The right front leg lies next to him, and five toes are stretched up.
I can count the scales in his sole."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell became a full shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident sat in a room rented through Airbnb on a bed, browsing on Facebook.
He came after the post of his former schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old young man and he still lay on the street."
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Posts of the user with the handle @TheePharoah had been repeatedly redistributed in their timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis region broadcast real-time tweets about Michael Brown, without armed with an 18-year-old black young man, who was killed by a white police officer in Missouri, Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, remaining there for four hours.
It's crazy," Ferrell thought about himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone off, but later in the evening saw again the tweets that this time announced the gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos of police tape and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the label "Ferguson's police killed my unarmed son!"
He looked at a real-time stream where the police guard stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, one of the other police officers wore a gun and shouted: "I will kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he struck himself from the thought, "It's unusual."
This is not the murder of the kind we are used to and we could call typical."
I knew the ghosts of fear at that point.
I was angry and cried."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 23 o’clock, he went to his father’s six-year-old daughter and decided that they would travel to the two of Fergusons the next morning.
What took place next three years with Ferrelli and Ferguson is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?", which will be premiered in cinemas on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the perspective of those who lived in this community and filled the answers in demand streets.
When Ferrell with her daughter - who was wearing a floral dress and was on her head going to Ferguson, they again talked about what had happened before that morning many times before - the experiences and living conditions of blacks.
Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" he recalls asking himself.
We are currently driving to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it is not correct."
I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell later said.
What is happening now is... the culmination that has taken place in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we need to do to get rid of ourselves.
Even if I manage to grow him so that he does not experience personally blatant racism, he is no different from another black girl.
I feel that I would make him a bear service if I protected him from this world."
The first stop they took when they arrived at Ferguson was on the road to South Florissant, a place beyond the police station, which had become a certain kind of camp site, where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Darren Wilson, to whom never finally been prosecuted.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with the local business owner, who prepared lunches.
They put together food bags and helped them to share them to protesters.
For Ferrelli slowly began to take shape a new type of activism.
My activism completely changed after 9 August," he said that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Federation of Minority Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
I had no organization experience.
It all just leaned."
A week later Ferrell met with a film co-director Sabaah Folayan during the evening celebration.
Folayan said that he and the filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
The question came to Ferrelli: "Do you try to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such skepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often white-skinned - come into the community and try to reap the benefits of its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already caught his hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the region known for activism in relation to sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project engaging for Ferrelli and another six local people who were watched by the "Whose Streets?" team for years after Brown was shot.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
For me, it was important how these people are depicted, as this is how I am depicted."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - it was to show that the movement was not "the Redeemer's guide, but the community reunion", as Folayan said -, he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing for the first time, when she saw a finished sheetwork.
But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain degree of vulnerability."
Moreover, the story of Ferrelli emphasizes and reiterates the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who thought about killing black teenage Trayvon Martin in 2012 out of the theme reference #BlackLivesMatter are homosexual.
In a leading role, black homosexual women have kept movement in general," Ferrell said, "and precisely because we have to constantly fight on several fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, stating that "the movement really keeps black women alive and many of them are black homosexual women".
At the same time, he claims that "it is not a matter of any type of equal opportunity" - Ferrelli was not selected as the center of the film because of his identity.
He was a person who aired the right energy," he said.
But this is not a coincidence that he was located right on the front line, because there is a lot of weight when he lived as a black homosexual woman at such hubs.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still brittle.
The penalty imposed on ferrell for blocking the road will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the area he calls home, just as a "thought-free".
However, he still considers it important to have mantra, which he has etched into memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson as a whole three years ago.
Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
7 tips on how to overcome a hangover after a Weekend party
Some of the stronger men’s sons, after a scary party, find it helpful.
Or it comes from the saying "avoid the hangover, stay drunk".
But this is just an inevitable postponement and a decent excitement for health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning and overcome the hangover as painlessly as possible after today and tomorrow’s Weekend Trampoline or other party?
Drink water.
Down and after alcohol, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, even in place of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when consuming alcohol, it must be recovered in any way.
Along with water, minerals are also washed out of the body and therefore it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after pinching, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
It is certainly not worth going to a grandmother to break the trees - it can turn out to be a fatal wrong decision.
But a light walk will help the body to remind you what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and falling out awkwardly is a more time-consuming way to get healthy.
Give the body energy back gradually and carefully.
If you’re about to start overdrafting before, you shouldn’t try to load a large fat frying pan.
For example, start with fresh juice that contains fruit sugars to quietly boost your body.
If you already suffer from health around the south, you might want to try broth, for example.
And a little later already on the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from the last water.
As already said, water and juice are your friends.
Do not bet on painkillers.
If you take an analgesic to avoid a hangover in the evening, your tax must also deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and thus lose performance.
This is how you break your liver even more, and in the future, the slums will be worse.
In addition, painkillers do not last any time in the body.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don’t do it on a full empty stomach - it will irritate your already hashed stomach.
Or if you don’t have a partner, get along well with yourself.
It has the same effect as walking, but walking does not get orgasms.
However, avoid too active tempo and crazy poses - during the hangover, physical effort should be moderate.
Make fun.
Tell your friends and fellow sufferers, make simple bows and laughs friendlyly over yourself as well as others (afflictions).
Jokes and laughter may not be mischievous, but it is certainly more fun to endure after-effects with them.
Once the hangover goes over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University staff were searched for as suspect in murder
According to the police, a Northwestern University professor and an employee of Oxford University are nationally sought out, who have received suspicions after finding a male corps of deadly stabile wounds in a single Chicago luxury apartment.
According to the court documents of Cook County, on Monday, arrest orders for arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued for arrest in the first-stage murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated puss.
According to a warning issued to the Chicago police station community, a corpse was discovered on 27 July.
Policemen received a phone call and found a victim on the arrival of the Grand Plaza apartment building, whose body had several prick openings.
According to the officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene and the researchers treat the puss as murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Since 2007 Lathe has worked as a Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of Public Relations at the University, said in an e-mail that Lathe has now been temporarily removed from work and is prohibited from entering Northwestern University campuses.
It is now a criminal investigational by competent authorities and the University of Northwestern cooperates with investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Assistant at Oxford University's Financial Department.
The representative of the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail, "We have been in touch with the British police and are ready to assist the US research institutions in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wished to be given out.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of the Communications Department at the Police Department of Chicago, urges suspects to give himself up to the authorities.
The police have an idea of where they are, but we are increasingly working on defining the exact location," said Guglielmi.
Guglielm says that local, regional and national authorities are helping to look for suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic hint that the apartment No 1008 had done something.
According to the police, it was a possible sight.
Guglielm argues that it is not clear whether the event was also held on 27 July.
He said that security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren’s stay in the building.
We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The management of Grand Plaza sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on chronology of events and the background of the victim, and explores various motives, including the possibility that it was a family dispute."
Start-ups to help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in his e-commerce startup, but the polls were revenueless.
The answers were often vague, useless or even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
This system simply wasn’t consistent and objective,” said Errett, who manages the e-commerce company Madison Reed, which sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for help from outside persons.
There are new types of start-ups dealing with human resources that will help companies figure out what their employees are familiar with.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow businesses to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases allow language users to bypass C-level managers and directly contact the board.
Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your business?", Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO, Redwood City, at Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Errett, he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and feel for three years when he has been using Glint.
In addition to research and surveys aimed at specific teams, it offers a company’s heat map, which provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to find out the reasons.
Companies have begun to realize that they need to keep up with their work culture so as not to become the next Uber that has been rioted into scandals since the former employee published a blog post describing the harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance may be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020 according to data from the FinTech Statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
The Denver Colorado-based startup Conference, which helps businesses prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, this year, Uber observed an increase in interest and activity in the background of the dubious reputation.
Convert has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convert lets companies send custom impulse surveys, gather confidential answers in real time, and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And when it comes to the CEO, complaints go directly to the board.
Public opinion has been reported by regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behaves unethically, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boy bags, staff leaving and cases, even if regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convert for more than a year to ensure employees’ awareness of regulations and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or e-mail address of the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a deterrent and uncomfortable process, said James Vitrano, General Counsel of Ruby Tuesday, according to whom there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, it is possible to identify and address problems such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay practices that did not previously reach managers in other cities or state offices faster.
I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
And we protect our shareholders from litigation with our employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behavior, values, and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after Arthur Andersen crashed due to ethical violations in connection with Enron’s scandal.
But only when "social media matured", the companies realized that they could not prevent their black lingerie from being washed publicly online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by charging companies periodically for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an option that has been approved by venture capital investors who have been supporting both startups.
Convercent was funded in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the capital it raised to $47 million.
In November Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s total funding to $60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise to take into account the interconnectedness of enterprises, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern employees expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just bets on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
If people are happy in the company, they feel listened to and the work they do is more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is vice-president of the overall benefit and employee experience in LinkedIn, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income if companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools allow you to increase employee commitment and engagement, it’s no wonder they’ll find support.
Having data on the involvement of employees is important, according to working culture experts.
However, this data is useless if the company’s overseers don’t get anything upside down with them.
In fact, when a company requests feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that there will be changes ahead.
And if the changes are not happening quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee engagement.
If you ask 4000 proposals, you need to be prepared for 4000 conversations," said the consulting and business management company Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen companies make a mistake that relies too much on data collection.
"For if things are not finished, then the employees think, "Do you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you do not care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly surveys among employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from the employees who were disappointed with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with the problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays is collecting new data on employees and hopes that in the long run it will lead to a longer commitment of employees in the industry, known for its high labour turnover.
If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you lose people," said Vitrano.
And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses."
The bright star in the euro area is the Baltics: incomes are growing fast
Although the crisis of 2008 and trade problems with Russia have affected the Baltic States, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes a reference to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999 the total economic output per person has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The success is backed by a low debt burden, quickly improving institutions and a business- and free market-friendly policy.
The central bank announced that "Baltic states in one of Slovakia are among the few countries in the euro area, where real GDP per person from purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average".
Although the aim is to ensure that the total economic output per capita would be equal to that of Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries in the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in positive light and the economy will continue to grow this year, the local population will not be enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, a little less than half of the respondents thought about the economies in their countries.
NCAA’s decision to cancel twice a day of workouts makes Bruins days long
The clock is almost 23 when the tropics of UCLA footballers stop at the edge of a new practice ground in the team campus.
Some of them have peeled off the shirt, revealing the sweaty back in the first day of their training camp.
For a large part of the team, these power minutes offer mid-day breaks.
Players taking part in the summer courses will go back to the dormitory to study for the final exam after three hours of training before returning to Wasserman Football Centre for meetings the next morning at 6.30.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them," said the Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The decision of the NCAA to cancel twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least up to the final exams on one side of the day on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three trainings were scheduled to start at 19.15 to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two workouts a day means more days with one workout - the start of the Bruins training camp was lifted almost a week ahead of the previous season, and for the first time during the Mora six Westwood season, the training takes place during the summer courses.
They will have 18 workouts until August 20th before the official preparation for the opening game Texas A&M in September begins.
Mora says he is in favour of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another agenda point to the player’s tight charts.
"They have a huge load on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," Mora said.
And they break through this challenge; they struggle, they are nice young.
I believe that when a Saturday arrives and we have more time, it’s really nice.”
When the camp is over, UCLA’s workouts are closed, which, however, is not an easy task, taking into account a clear view of the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin center, a higher-class hotel that has already received footballs from the net around the gate station.
Starting from this weekend, the hotel’s Bruins players will occupy, but Mora admitted that problems may arise with free rooms during the season.
"We implement security measures," Mora said.
This is a real concern, and it is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film training there.
If you have a recording of your workout, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we use the security team there and on the 8th parking lot.
We do our best to use.
I try not to worry much about it.
We have a plan in place."
In retaliation of Savisaar-Ivanova, an election coalition for Savisaar-Ivanova, an election coalition for businessmen founded by Kristiina Ojuland and Maria Kaljuste, who has been expelled from the Reform Party, and about our parties, it seems that the election coalition created on the initiative of the parties will participate in the local elections at least as much as political parties this year.
However, chicks are considered to be in the fall, and the key question is whether there are enough disappointed voters for them all.
Who stays with Savisaar?
If the support team of Edgar Savisaar has been reduced to a small extent, he may not be able to guess the events organized in honor of his election coalition.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current median people and many unknown faces – is it possible to be a member of the election coalition?
And can the reason why some of Savisaar’s faithful followers and friends evade the application in Tallinn be found to be a reality in the search for the “List of Savisaar”, led by corrupters and suspected of corruption?
The Russian pop song of the music video filmed on the roof of the city district government, in which the elder of Lasnamäe district participates; and in every sense, the original computer game, in which the main character Jüri Ratas must avoid the squirrels and squirrels that have been hit on the road while riding the bike - does the Center Party try to do so for the first time the voters of 16 and 17 years allowed to go to the ballot boxes?
We are waiting for the idea of other parties in a youth electoral campaign.
If the channel 2 or TV3 viewer is watching a black square from the beginning of August instead of a show of entertainment, there are two options: to accept that in the future, only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels will be seen in the free broadcast or to surrender tens of each month to some TV operator.
There are probably also those who initially publicly enjoy the ad-free TV experience, but in the end - although reluctantly - pay for the TV picture and advertisements.
The side-locking music, the noisy people and the spam left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to take part in the memorabilia yourself, but instead of hurting your head at home, it’s worth noting homeland - and sleeping place to leave for the festival guests for a hefty amount.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump, according to whom a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by republicans and supported by the President.
The Bill of Law will be discussed in two chambers of the Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it changes the way U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law reduces chain migration and begins to replace the current program.
The new application process gives an advantage to applicants who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and the skills that come to our economy,” Trump said, according to the United States media outlets.
The Siberian Seto young people move to the city, pensioners return to the countryside.
Jevsejev’s Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners along the former river Maana.
He works at home 140 kilometres from home as a gold driver on the edge of the Maana tributary River in the Kuai.
It is a rough job: two consecutive months without rest days for 12 hours work, and then only ten days at home and again.
During the three years worked at the Artel, Anatoli has seen gold only once.
"There is a hard turn: when going in, it is thoroughly checked so that the vodka does not take along, and when going out so that the gold does not take along," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho chatting with the local Seto Jaani in Haida village, who has told her a lot about the memories of her family in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved by the Siberian Setos also begins to influence the home-setos, because it is simply so fabulous, thinks Piho Mare, the most thoroughly researched distant Setos.
His first research trip to Siberia will take 30 years this year.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many settled out in Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I claim that 8000.
I considered this according to the stories of the Siberian Seto men who have thought of it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at that time up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was granted only to a man.
The passport was given to only one, but it was accompanied by children, sisters and other female relatives.
See how big this territory was here!
It was many times larger than the historical Setomaa.
After all, it was necessary to educate, manage in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their life changed because here they came into areas not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (log rafting), gold mines, and industry.
For example, in New Petseri, many Setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (the Soviet authorities built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.), when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in this region at that time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and multi-childhood remained long.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much was Siberian Seto culture different from that of motherhood Seto?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought with them a lot of folk costumes.
Then they made their own clothes, but they always made a difference, which was brought along and what was done here.
Climate change strongly affected Setos’ traditional clothing, because it is colder here.
Food changes.
For example, meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are the villages of Siberian Seto and what life is lived there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setomaa begins to give back there, begins to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is referring to the people of the Estonian Setos delegation who came to visit the Kingdom of Seto in early July and lived in homes for four days - J.P.
What's still here is it's fabulous.
It’s super easy to come to Tapa and go away as well, because the city has a great location: at the railway hub and at the intersection of roads,” says Reigo Tamm, an operaist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural sites, and the seal can be obtained from every corner.
Kill is a top-top city!
There is a small island along the Valgejõgi running through the town, where the people of Tapas practice to have a Midsummer party.
"This beautiful place is not visible from the train window", muffling Reigo.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of sources.
I have been swimming there, I can do it all!
On the river’s side you can have a picnic and just do romance – you can see the flow of the river and think about life in advance and behind it.
I have also walked there with my brides.
In addition to everything else on the riverbanks, Tamm, an operaist, has been practicing his arias: "That this place is by the city, no one may come up against when I make my stories."
From Männikumäe you can enjoy a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter, and now, for example, play disc golf - golf is done, disks can be rented from the fitness centre", heads Reigo.
Old professionals go there, of course, with their own discs, but I haven’t yet played there.
You probably have to invite a colleague Rasmus Kull to Tapa because he is an experienced disc golfer and he has disks.
Maybe he lends me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears, disappointments and you can win in my sports life on this mountain.
Not to mention broken bells and skis.
"The whole city center is currently full of construction work, all of it becomes unknown", praises Reigo.
However, the old and tired station of Tapa is a very attractive place where summer productions are played.
I am glad that Märt Meos, the CEO of R.A.A.A.Mi, received my idea in 2012 and had to do a summer theatre in the left.
Although this year's theatre season with Alexei Karenin was just over, on August 11, there is a "Illu wake-up" in the railway station, when the old museum house moves around in the 1980s.
From 11th to 13th of August, Tapa Town Days are the days in which several cultural events, including the public rally, have awakened in addition to the museum’s open home cafés and are taking place,” says Reigo, who recommends visiting the city of 91 years old in the very days.
The small yellow cottage on the 1st May boulevard has been a museum since 1994.
The house is small, but there are plenty of exhibits and information hugely", Reigo praises the place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railway and military.
Reigo makes sense that if Tapa has all the recommended places to go through, the stomach will be empty for a long time, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
We have such good eateries and sometimes sitting in cafés feel like you are abroad", he describes.
The educated and young soldiers who came to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town, but there is such an international company together around you.
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, moving us a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The television channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, the police arrested a group of illegally camping people on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but currently there is an investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and already impose severe fines on anyone who misses a holiday in a place that is not intended to do so.
The inspections will continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Wolves teach puppies to break sheep.
After a year of pause, the farmers of Hiiumaa must give the wolves their herd "learning material" - probably the wolves taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves have broke sheep in Hiiu county three times, a total of 23 sheep and have injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year there were only three numbers, a year earlier 124.
In synchronization with the dialects, data from the environmental agency is also that last year there were no wolf litters in Hiiumaa and information from the Hiiumaa hunting council that two wolf nests are fixed on the island this year.
On Monday, the wolves broke in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste municipality and injured the 18 surviving sheep.
On Wednesday morning, wolves broke a sheep in the herd of Reheselja village and seriously injured another one to whom an emergency surge had to be made.
Rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft Act to introduce genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and to amend the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the Act waives the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and handlers, using the plant health register in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the operator of the GM crop to have prior agreement with apiculture person within the prescribed limits is amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least for as long as it has not been decided to declare Estonia GMO free", said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
However, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, account being taken of the costs and administrative burdens of both the private and public sectors,” added Suu.
The draft Act repeals the provisions related to the database of places and operators of GM crops and the training of handling, establishes the requirements for the handling of GM crops and commencement of economic activities.
In particular with regard to beekeeping, the obligation of the GM farmer to inform the beekeepers about the start of GM crop cultivation is replaced by the obligation to achieve an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before beginning cultivation.
The Bill of Law has been sent for approval to ministries.
All interested parties have the opportunity to get acquainted with this in the information system of drafts and, if they wish, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes affect in particular the persons active in the field of crop production, the beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop - corn MON 810.
So far, none of the Estonian farmers has been interested in growing GM crops.
The reason for this is that there is no corn pest in Estonia, a European stalker with regard to which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, varieties of this maize line have been bred to southern regions, and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
The Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned surveys in 2015 and 2016 on the detection of possible pollution of GM organisms in seeds of various varieties of summer rape, corn and soy grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and as a result of the study it was concluded that the seeds of the varieties of rape, corn and soy grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be inferred from the above that in Estonia, deliberately modified crops are not cultivated, and it was also confirmed that no accidental contamination occurred.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United recruited a "genus" in the form of Nemanya Maticu
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited the "genus" in the form of Nemanja Maticu, after his debut was made on Wednesday night against the central field player Sampdoria.
A player bought over for £40 million from Chelsea began playing the final pre-season game in Dublin against Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday for 2-1 wins in the boot line, impressing in the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on offensive trips.
But having been out of the Blues pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was desperately in need of a match, and he endured it for only 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, for sure to improve before the Premier League season begins.
He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant mindset - he has a football mindset," said Mourinho.
We will help him to achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began their initial lineup at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho started to quietly set up their eleven men for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers this week, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "excellent job" by signing contracts with the three of his four priority options.
I am grateful to the club that they were able to accomplish three of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another son of the shoal got a GSM transmitter to the foot on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a birdwatcher living in Sõrve, the first stork son was equipped with a transmitter in Sõrve, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest place and joined Mulltu-Suurlahe’s large overnight accommodation collection.
This is because there are no grain fields in Sõrve, writes Saarte Hääl.
On this Tuesday, relatively late to ring the cranes, another stork became attached to the shipper, and that on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter in Sõrve, Türu.
His actions are all visible on the Internet: how he went to winter in Spain, coming back a long time in the tops of the German and Polish borders, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
British inventor let a microchip be installed in his body to get into the house and car with a hand gesture
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he can open his front, get to the office, and even run a car with just a hand gesture.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and index finger and now also offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, the consultant and anesthesiologist of the Royal Hospital of Hampshire in Hanchester, to ensure that the installation procedure is in compliance with the medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip installed on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company also replaces the locks for houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, asking for a single lock of £300.
This married father of one child has now installed the technology both at home and in his car the BMW Z4 that starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The exhibit of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents issued to the magazine TIME, the decision of the White House to fly a naval helicopter to a southern court for an event celebrating American production in the previous month, cost taxpayers as much as $24 000.
Sikorsky VH-3D, a green and white colour called Marine One, was the central attraction for the American construction program that took place in the White House on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and the senior officials of the White House visited industrial products from all 50 countries on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with the Maine yacht, the Wisconsin fire truck and the Mississippi forklift.
According to the documents of the squadron One (HMX-1) squadron, who is responsible for the helicopter operation, the White House's military cabinet demanded the presence of the helicopter with FARGO only 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south for an "unusual" event.
I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually big event," said HMX-1 commander in an e-mail to his boss, the deputy naval chief officer in the field of aviation.
It was noted in the message that the helicopter would arrive at the southern yard on the morning of 17 July at about 15 o’clock for the event and remain there until the same evening between 18 o’clock and 21 is cleaned.
It was added that if departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew member will be required for the return flight due to working hours restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the squad of the squadron remained close to the aircraft for the entire period of its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to find out from the documents given to the magazine TIME whether the second project was eventually needed or not.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal staff from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether the event could violate this provision.
We asked if it violates Hatchi's law, and we were told not to spoil," wrote Commander.
"It seems that you do not have a choice," the deputy of the leading officer replied.
The White House declared the event "made in America" as an official event and the Hatchi law would not have covered it.
But even at official events there are political undertones.
The President supported the health reform efforts at the Senate at that time and welcomed the efforts to keep government regulations in control.
Use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them for a purely photo session is unusual.
Trump came to the attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, rolled a president plane in the background, and his Twitter account swarms from messages that complain about how his predecessor used the plane.
The White House is very pleased with the exhibition "made in America", where the products from all 50 states, made by American workers," said Lindsay Walters, spokesperson for the White House.
The HMX-1 teams often perform testicles around Washington and in the south yard to practice setting down to the White House, President of the United States.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 hosted 58 attempts at the White House in the yard.
According to the official, the flight to the "American" flight team was included in the standard of the month's study flights.
The squadron helicopters also flew for 11 hours on that day for "non-president support missions".
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits of this event overloaded the taxpayer’s wallet.
According to Sikorsky’s representative, the company was not involved in arranging the exhibition on the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain the budget documents of the President’s flights, and it is difficult to find out the exact costs of the event.
But according to the hourly prices of the Ministry of Defence for 2017 the compensation rate for VH-3D is $24 380 per flight hour.
In the squadron documents, the flight was marked from the Navy's Quantico aerodrome in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
The calculation of taxpayers’ expenses based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading,” said Walters.
These estimated compensation rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to a survey by the RAND of 2015, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include staff costs, but they cover the costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
The former spokesman for the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopter at that time at the event.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," said Spicer.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have labored tirelessly.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it."
It is not clear whether Trump was in contact with the helicopter during the tour on the southern yard, but he sat behind the wheel of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky’s representatives, throwing jokes about the company’s products on media outlets in his personal aircraft fleet.
I know Sikorsky very well," said President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through tears arrived peace and joy
In 2011, the MIL Daegu hit Shadeiko in the last area, a foot ramp of 800 m runs, and a leg frame was taken from the stadium.
Just before that he had received zero in the long jump on the universe held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EMI violated the injury suffered in low-cost terms, but in the London Debut Olympics, it won its 23rd place at 6013 points.
However, the misfortune continued.
After the opening day of the 2013 Moscow MIL, an Estonian long-distance event in the record schedule of the Estonian record received a hefty injury.
Two years later, he received 15th place in the Beijing MIL and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but even so he wanted more frustration for the athlete.
Shadeiko only passed through the heaviest gadle flag last year, when he didn’t receive the result in the long jump of the ÖM in Amsterdam.
I would just like to put together a decent multi- competitions once.
Once", sculled Shadeiko.
The worst was ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was already interrupted due to a thigh injury on the first hurdle.
The time had to be taken down - should I continue with the 7th competition at all?
Is two days of effort still worth it?
The maid thought for a long time, but found peace in herself.
I got my head to think clean
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and have to think clean.
I knew that I didn’t put the pills in the bag yet,” says Shadeiko of his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the clean page and move on with a new speed.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the subjects, but he realized that the athlete had to find out himself in particular.
After all, he was so buried by everyone.
It was difficult to tolerate it.
"Grit, however, said that he would not give up and he wants to prove what he is worth", says Mägi.
Now he has some kind of peace.
He does it for himself.
The competition came back in May when Shadeiko set 6280 points for the new Estonian record at the Götzis multi-competition.
At the high-level competition, he improved the top brand by nearly a meter (13.89) and ran during a time close to record.
Then the adversary felt that it was not the ceiling of the abilities, but only the first hunger for the competition was cleared.
Mägi, guided by him for years, says that Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He is ready for the athlete, he is good to train.
If something does or is wrong, he says it immediately.
He knows his body and trusts his sense.
That is what we have to follow.
I cannot say what exactly needs to be done and we follow it.
The new approach has also been found by Shadeiko.
I’m not the one who makes the most of the training, he says and says that getting the right feeling is the most important thing, because it also ensures a good result.
Baby luck makes loved ones happy
Good emotions have also offered Šadeiko the happiness of loved ones.
Both his former training companion Maris Mägi and his sister Grete recently became parents, and the adversary has received support from new world citizens.
"Pretty interesting has been", says Shadeiko.
One alcohol that drinking equals "training" of the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is quite such a big wine fan that he believes - with wine you can train the brain better than with any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
In his words, it is not alcohol, or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather in the "very active" wine tasting process.
By sniffing the glass, spinning the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and perceiving the aftertaste, we put our brain to work to create a taste for the wine.
Sheperd said that wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He brings a comparison to how the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste is not wine, the taste creates a wine taster", says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admirs that wine is not to drink full.
In action, there must be more, he says.
If you take too big a sip, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who are risking over three glasses of wine, memory loss, balance and reduced mental ability.

According to the UN, the role of women in Afghan democracy in politics depends on
The Head of Mission of the United Nations Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can represent the people only if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women apply for municipal elections, three women apply for vice-presidents, and more than 30 percent of recent voters are women.
It is not possible to exaggerate the role of women by emphasising the importance of women," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the election process.
Municipal elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has threatened the election process, which coincides with the transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year’s election marks the first time that one democratically elected government is given over to the next.
According to Haysom, women’s strong role increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent election committee of Afghanistan, 1.2 million women have registered from 3.6 million voters.
The joy of sharing makes every thing fiercer, both big and small.
There’s always too little time in common, but training with the little ones gives a good opportunity to combine a meeting, a game, closeness and load.
And whatever a convenient solution - wherever you travel in the summer, you will always have the gondola with you and will remind you with your fine voice, "Let's work out now too!"
Start heated - very good is a regular hawk game or along the beach strip flagging.
The squat is the foundation for staying in the form of legs and buttocks - who would like to take the shape of a sand cake washed from waves during the summer?
The wonder is to use children instead of a lever!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight will gradually increase at the same rate as the strength of the trainer.
Advanced can also make squats with pretty big children.
The child trains the balance, reads the repetitions and feels the opportunity to lean high and be important.
Larger children can make their own squats at the same time.
The extent of the movement is determined by touching the ground and stretching up the hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini helper to hold on properly.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a trainer.
Plank is an extremely useful but hopelessly boring exercise for your child.
But it’s easy to make things more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank column to take turns to get along.
In fact, it is more difficult, but much more fun to make when in the meantime you can give your friend a hand.
To add a load, you can stay in the foreground, on the little shoulder, and also walk around in this position.
You can put a smaller child on your hips for extra weight, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While crabs on the sand syllable, triceps, buttocks and abdominal muscles get a load like a nectar.
The child descends on his feet in such a way that his weight is equally distributed forward and backward.
You can hold your hands on for security.
Cure your legs and straighten straight up.
Põnn can fly, have fun, train balance, and be struggling.
The life of a small trainer is extra fun when he gets a small piece of music every time he comes up.
Additional load gives the legs a stretch in advance.
Check that the back stays in neutral position.
In children themselves, it is much more fun to do abdominal muscles with a pair and a clap.
Handcraft and hearth squat.
Monitor the child's safety, knee position, and keep the spine in neutral position.
All children's favorite and great fun!
For parents, at the same time, truly effective full-body workout.

A trip from the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans with a wide world or shoulder bag
Shoulder braided bags are the summer classics that have become a hit product on their own in recent years, which must be hung on one of the right summer lovers and have been able to weld a price tag that matches the hit despite its modest origins.
A bag made of straw is probably one of the things that everyone has had once in their life and the possession of which has not caused special emotions.
It’s just there, and if not, there’s nothing broken either.
Now, however, shoulder bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have exchanged their exquisite designer bags for simple, straw-worn bags for the summer months.
It’s not just a beach bag, it’s just as popular today as a street bag and even more courageous women walk to the office.
However, it is worth making sure whether the summer look for the boss is still sitting or whether it is worth pushing the notebook and laptop a little more official amount.
However, variety has made shoulder bags a real summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing left is that fashion gourmets take the first thing on a holiday trip to the local market and buy some shoulder bags on which the whole rest time is faithful and which goes along the beach, on the market and also on girlfriends in town.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger pile of bags from the market and sell or give away them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that there is such a high demand among readers that women (and men) probably go to each other hand to become a happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, such madness is also understandable, because rarely these are times when it is possible to buy a thing that has risen to hit status for just a few dozen euros in the fashion world.
True, cunning merchants have also discovered a simple money-making opportunity here, and so the finer luxury brands also sell beer bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably still that the richest customers should not feel like a simple mortal, who will promenade a circle with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana a shoulder bag that pays over a thousand euros.
However, the interpretation of the Chanel shoulder bag can be carried out around 6000 euros.
Unlike most fashion buildings, however, straw bags do not come from a few big fashions, but their story started from afar.
Namely, shoulder bags are supposed to come from far away from the Philippines, where they are worn without wide weather.
The braiding of a straw bag is mainly there for the export business and the locals do not see it very often.
It is said that the beer weaving technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite similar to ordinary basket weaving.
However, because the shoulder bag does not have to be as drown as hard as the basket, patterns and other materials can be embedded in them, which make the bag more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, there are recently particularly trendy bags with coloured ribbons or leather strips.
However, thanks can be sent primarily to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided shoulder bag fan who was not seen before.
Namely, he matched the shoulder bag with all kinds of clothing sets and didn’t even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival with it.
Nowadays, however, the fact that care for them is also less important, and unlike all other sums, it is not necessary to take care of them by special means, but also by water and wet towel.
As always, brands that have come up with a classic look have come up with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, you can buy a braided side of the straw or a tiny shoulder bag if you wish.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but the shoulder ridge does.
But, then, what is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, such a bag of straw has been considered classic, reminiscent of its style in the basket, is open and has shortness, as well as straws, handles.

GMB worries about investments into McVitie's Glasgow factory
The trade union expects the leaders of the cookie manufacturer, McVitie, to confirm the long-term production plans of the company's Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has silenced the investment of the Tollcross object on the future.
More than 500 people work in a factory that manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
The owner of McVitie in Pladis said they had invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
Employees and trade union chairmen were employed there, "the first to hear" if something changes in the activities of the factory.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland turned to McVitie's request "dissolve concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernize production lines".
Drew Duffy, the Senior Organisation of GMBH, said: "The fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the object regarding the business needs and future investment plan of Tollcross makes our members deeply concerned.
There have been several generations of families here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around Glasgow, being an essential pillar for decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, Glasgow needs a rapidly growing company in McVitie, in the face of jobs, wages and well-being in the east, as well as Brexit, an increase in living costs and a chronic decrease in production."
A representative of Pladis said: "The site manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting took place in Tollcross between employees and GMB representatives, where several problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5 million in a Tollcross object, most of it has gone to production lines and to improve operations.
We fully understand the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and if there are any changes in the activities of the site, the employees and representatives of the trade union are the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of a three-year-old approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up the quest to entice Neymar into its ranks, making an offer of £189 million for his buy-out, but did they warn Barcelona of this record-break three years ago?
This enigmatic approach has opened a summer transition window, and Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than double the current world record of buying over, set up last season with Paul Pogba’s return to Manchester United for £89 million.
Once the transition is completed, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world, and at the same time the highest-paying professional athlete in the world, starting to pay over £500 per week after the payment from PSG.
Barcelona is, of course, angry with both the approach and the free break-up of Neymar, although a source close to the board of Catalans confirms that the club has always taken the best care of its footballer since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the President of PSG warn the football world of this possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City showed an interest in entering into a contract with Blaise Matuti in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
I don't worry because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will welcome them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign a contract with one of our players, they have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border as the Spanish club previously showed interest in the central PSG player Marco Verratt this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and that Barcelona could get back as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in Neymar’s form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not boundaries, after Brexit.
The "Brexit threatens to seriously defeat wedges between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland", Varadkar warned Northern Ireland on his first visit after his appointment in June.
I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the free movement of current people and goods, said Varadkar.
This is our vision for the future: build bridges, not boundaries," he emphasized.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and since it is not possible, to remain part of the European common market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain’s departure smoother would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained by the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We certainly could have such a Britain".
An alternative would be to return to the customs offices that would declare a historical divide and a political failure.
The barrier to trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with leaders from key parties in Northern Ireland while visiting Belfast.
Märt Avandi, who passed his first semi-long triathlon: Ironman is able to pass everyone.

The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi also triumphantly finished the first triathlon of his life.

Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that, in fact, triathlon is affordable for almost everyone.
Not the distance kills, but the pace kills, he said, suggesting that almost everyone reaches the finish line at an affordable pace.
With the exception of Ott Sepp, "Ot with the physicist is all right, but unfortunately he can't swim".
Avandi had been exercising a lot since February.
At the beginning of 4-5 hours a week, later, ten hours a week.
By 05:34:12 he reached the 270th place in general.
While Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other competitors in the so-called "prominent class".
Tanel Padar, who had been a "good role model person" last year, lost Avant in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times according to 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
German Johannes Moldan was crowned the overall winner of the accounting for men at the Otepää stage in the Ironman series in 3:58:27, and Ivo Suur from Estonians was the best in time 04:14:09.
Among women, the Dane Helle Frederiksen won with the time 04:24:01, but from Estonians Maria Jänes, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour and got by 04:58.
Avandi passed the 1.9 km swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410th position.
