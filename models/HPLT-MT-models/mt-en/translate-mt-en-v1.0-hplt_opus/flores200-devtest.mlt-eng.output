While one experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola mortality, so far, no medicine has been clearly shown to be suitable for the treatment of existing infection.
One cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed potential in the field, but formal studies indicated that it had less benefit than that sought in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMap served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments with it.
The USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making progress with significant changes within our organisation, rather than by removing certification.
The USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse of the ratio described so courageously by those rescued by Larry Nassar has remained undetected for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate changes.
The USA Gymnastics and USOC share the same goal - to make gymnastics sport, and others, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and authorized environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown at the top and the bottom is clear or carotenoid-coloured.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called rachis, but have other feather characteristics - "barbs" and "barbules" - researchers have inferred that rachis was likely an evolutionary development that followed these other traits.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used for flying but rather for temperature regulation or display.The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows a feather of an adult rather than a thin, soft feather of the young.
Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the fur of a wedge.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killing two police officers and injured more than twenty others.

Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star in relation to the magnetic reversal.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team is caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the St Anna Street.
Just as the moon has a draw on the earth, and causes tides, so also the Way of St. Anne exerts force on the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter as does regular matter.
This theory states that the majority of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a type of diadem and is composed of many small particles.

Dr Tony Molla discovered the Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "deeply disturbing and alarming due to the very high rate of fatalities."
Dr. Molla thinks that some patients may have taken the bug from the hospital, and at least two were hospital health workers.
Within one year, an infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any given moment in South Africa.

Their thermal behaviour is not as constant as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but is consistent with these deep ground holes," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey Team (USGS) and North University of Arizona located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters self-isolate in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officers verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters' names.
French electoral law codifies the proceedings quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of voters counted and duly authorised.
Candidates can send representatives to testify to each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strong supervision, according to specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's seating group failed to complete their laps, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Salom did not rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop".
The accused are referred to as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious injuries in his head.
The road to the crash was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with murdering her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody until she is charged and processed, but any testimony of ocular witnesses may be influenced because her photo has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists appear to be in danger if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally in charge of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least before the charge.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine must rely on before the Middle East War of 1967.
Other topics covered include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel calls for a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
Shoters in the supplementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest keepers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership of NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association (Sporters Association) hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received a comprehensive instruction in safety and training.
Martelly sworn in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures for the country to move towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had to be held in 2011.
About 60 cases of damaged iPods have been reported due to overheating, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed about the 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company referred to as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. at local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there were no reported damages in the nation.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has detained Hong Kong tourists as hostages by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle in the direction of tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six were confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he was in hospital, Liggins began investigating the premature payment during his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered this would speed up the maturation of the infant's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two 'black boxes' that are the flight recorders.
Her fellow collectors also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager Luna died on the night of the two moons.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was unusual like me...maybe even more than I...I love it and miss it...we hope it is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, provisional Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believes Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of respondents agree with this view, and would like Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
In the extremes of voting, 29 per cent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal was expected to swim in 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games relays, but due to his complaints there were doubts about his state of health.
He could not take the necessary drugs for his pain as they are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a computer science mathematician and professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number by 25 January.
Many people have verified the discovery using different hardware and software by early February and this was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets form, especially as the Earth has formed, as comets have collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, started ruling earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumour as "parole and political stupidity".
It is speculated that he will present a candidacy for a president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to old ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is being placed and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of lack of transport have raised the possibility of the game being forced to play behind closed doors without team fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" provided a report on the creation of new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported that the new species only evolved in two generations, although this process was thought to last much longer, due to the mating between endemic Darwin, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus sponge, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold may be produced in any form. It may be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can then be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and attached to another metal.It can become so thin that it was sometimes used for decorating hand-painted images in books called "lightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical.You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes colour depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have their electrons removed from them (as the hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two dry powders together and then, with wet and clean hands, press them into a ball.
Moisture on your hands will react to the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a sort of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia and ancient China.In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women met together in a mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and view.
A giant rocket over 100 feet long is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has turned the world into unbelievable ways.The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transport.
He brought with him the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Under them there are more medium-sized cats that eat the medium-sized prey that varies from rabbits to antilopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including cats that are free pets) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task that every cat has and prevents from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and they live in large groups who say "prides" in English.
The groups (prides) are made up of one to three related adult masks, plus a maximum of thirty females and pups.
Women, in general, are closely related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
The Ijun groups act like groups of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behaviour, and are also very deadly for their prey.
A good athlete in all things, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, miss great distances and pull five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lions, leopards, and gowns, and these four cats are the only ones who can graze strongly.
The tiger tiger is not like the lion's strong-voice tiger, but rather like a bulky-tied sentence of words.
They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that hunt them are much smaller than the ocean.
Scientists think that the oocytes follow and find animals to eat (prey) with smell, sniffing the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with the vision of a night, and they move by hiding, too.
When a small group of living things (small population) is separated from the main population that came from it (such as if moving on a mountain or river range, or if moving to a new island so that they cannot move back easily) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they previously needed.
The original population has not changed anything, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population starts to adapt to its new environment, it starts to appear less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands of years or even millions of years, the two populations will seem so different that they will not even be able to be called the same species.
This process tells us speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
The plants create oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (i.e., inhale it).
The plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and make clothes from plants.Many food we eat is plants.Without plants, animals can no longer survive.
The mosaic was the predator of the peak of his time, so he was not afraid of anything, except other mosaics.
Her long jaw was filled with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as another set of years with the roof of her mouth, meaning that anyone on her way could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a broken tongue in two. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosaics, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not have won it.
While the majority of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent like a mouse that sleeps a lot.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman were eating their food sitting on the chairs, the rich men would like to have dinner together where they would throw themselves on their side while eating their food.
The meals of Ancient Rome could not include food that came from Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they did not have wheat, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman never played turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods which was considered to be the house of the god.
The people took sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in the temple and, after that, a sanctuary inside which only the priests could enter.
Special towers were sometimes built in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was in the open air.
The women used to make cooking in the courtyard; the shops were simply an open counter opposite the street. The stones were used for house building.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
In Norway sagas it is said that Erik Red was exiled from Iceland due to murder, and when he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, regardless of the discovery he made, at that time they were already living there the Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was 'Scandian', there were many differences between people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you might think that there was a treasure map at the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasury map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "original declaration of independence dated 4 July 1776".The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who they wrote, it is known that early in their history, the large document produced by parchment (a measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation has been added simply as a label.
The descent of Day D and the ensuing battles had liberated the north of France, but the south still remained unfree.
It was led by the French "Vichy" who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had freed the South of France and were turning to Germany.
Civilisation is a unique culture shared by a large and significant group of people living and working cooperatively, society.
The word civilization comes from Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civilis words, which means citizen, and civics, which means city or city-state, and which in a certain way also defines the size of society.
A civilisation culture implies the transfer of knowledge from various generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognised as appropriate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—where Congress was its only component—under the articles of the Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce all its acts but, often, they did not cooperate.
He had no power to overcome tax and tariffs laws between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup samples in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international matches and Olympic events.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) and, therefore, it makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, on a geographical location, as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan dates back from the early 15th century where European sailors passing through there registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in Southwest Taiwan, starting transformation into aboriginal wheat production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the Sino-Japanese First War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Shimonoseki Treaty, which gives rise to sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which regulates the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Room.
A large part of the building at the ends of the complex was rebuilt so that tourists could have a clearer idea of how it originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of fixed image photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant size of the film at the close of the era of analogue film.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is currently somewhat confusing, 36mm wide with a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, a family of APS formats) are equal to, or very similar to, this aspect ratio.
The highly abused and ridiculed third party rule is often a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining an order-in-image measure.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into third parties vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion has united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His great power affected everyone from the king to the common village.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after the hostilities broke out, Britain began a German naval blockade.
The strategy has proved effective, by stopping vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain has undermined international waters to prevent ships from entering full ocean sections, causing a danger also to neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine war without restrictions.
Over the 20s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of peace and isolation.
After seeing the terrible things and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former job manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different periods of time; every stage of China and every family that had the power were distinctive dynasties.
Also between each dynasty there was a time of instability with divided provinces.The most well-known of these periods was the age of the Three Kingdoms that lasted 60 years between the Han Dynasty and that of Jin.
During these periods of time there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in ancient China's history, killing thousands of humans fighting to take the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absoluteism to republicism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to just one ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants and this allowed those who were the most ambitious and able to succeed.
The same goes for the military because instead of being class-based, the army's rankings were now based on the calibre.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other people of the repressive working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in issues beyond this worldly life.He frequented a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (a light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which continued to exist over time, clearly shows Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On the top of one of the mountains in northern Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find anything even if someone knows that it exists. Once you enter the cave, there is total isolation.
There can be nothing but a clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around the world, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Dead Valley contains several pyramids (which is the largest pyramid among them), several small crypts, several temples, and the great sphincters.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, the crypts and temples were built to honor the women and relatives of Khufu.
The "upward playing" mark looks like V and the "down-playing mark" looks like a staple or a square shape without the lower side.
Upward means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (the place where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward playback of a stringed instrument generates a softer sound, while the downward playback is stronger and more assertive.
You can make the marks you want with a pencil, but remember that the bowing marks are there for a musical reason and therefore, normally, they must be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, 11 and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and sister of King Elizabeth, terrified, were forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 from Versailles by a violent crowd of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a car surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats against the King and the Queen.
The crowd forced the King and the Queen to keep their car windows open wide.
At one point a member of the crowd waved the head of the royal guardian who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war expenditures of the United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay most of the expenditures and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of the imperialism of the United States.
To understand the Templars you need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time in which events commonly occurred was called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000–300).
Before the High Middle Ages there was the Early Middle Ages followed by the late Middle Ages, which is agreed to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a country-wide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car mass ownership also leads to a higher occurrence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care techniques for the repair of damaged bodywork.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed individuals and, over time, resulted in customs and culture related to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as a luxury epicentre began around 400 A.D. and lasted up to about 1100 A.D.
His status deteriorated during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusades had returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing had a major influence on Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because the communication channels are slow, Western styles can be left behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began developing its own style, one of the biggest developments of that time as a result of the crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten up clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet only the needs of the agricultureer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, seed-bearing system that is native to the eco-region along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yields.
Historically many farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel forgotten by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
Qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership using a different and symbolic style, which includes ways, manners, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialisation is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, wilful misery or abuse, have not been socialised by adults as they were growing up.
Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of the children was due to the parents' refusal of intellectual or physical impairment of the children.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When fully reared by non-human animals, the wild child shows almost entirely (within physical limits) behaviour as that of the particular animals he has taken care of, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the learning method called scaffolding is more effective.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but, rather, an aid to provide support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold but even the small man of the paper clip at Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and aims to ask, prompt, and explain the procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to manage them alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons involving negligence, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but this still happens.
We consider the Foster Care System as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving overseers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the house that was taken from it before.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and satisfactions.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, the surface movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are, however, able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills in the interpretation of human behaviour also exist in animals such as pets.
20th century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the set of variation expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine the variation between the two groups with each generation.
In savannah, it is difficult to prime with a digestion system such as that of humans meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: a reduction in growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins accessible in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but provides a high quantity of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Given all the above, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" almost in the same way that they do today the chimpanzees who live in savana.
Interruption of sleep is the process of waking up specifically during your normal period of sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using relatively quiet disclosures that will make you unconscious without completely arousing you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluids (in particular water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bedtime, thereby causing the person to wake up to pass urine.
The amount of internal peace a person has is correlated in a opposite way to the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of life is, each person has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
Everyone can become enlightened.The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but they were widened by the passing of mahayana's love and many techniques by Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.
With Kundalini Yoga the energy of Kundalini (lighted energy) is raised through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. Through the visualization of various gods one cleanses the energy channels, activates chakras and creates awareness of illumination.
Germany was still common in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war the system disagreements, process and culture led countries to fight.
After only two years since the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It had to last for the next 40 years and had to be fought with real, alternative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defence was already divided, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise itself along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the ability of your enemy to move people and his goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II.The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Britain as it did to the rest of Europe.
It turns out that the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to have an easy way of acquiring milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in hill-bound herds or other pasture areas, often attended by goat herds which were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herdsmen.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden plates, they allowed horses to pull them to obtain higher speeds and pull higher loads than on the roads a few more roughs of the time.
Crossies (crossed knots) were introduced quite early to keep track in place, however, gradually it became realised that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip at the top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden cart wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully ferrous lines were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning a standing man) appeared.
Their predecessors, the Austraopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specialties are found in the Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs from even seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also be activists in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases, however, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we should find the source of the problems, and we should disable it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and the problems have become greater because of humanity's overpopulation and extravagant way of life.
Following its adoption by Congress on 4 July, the handwritten bill signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as "the Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered that it be read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest copies that have remained in force of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today, we call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and pointed nails, they lay eggs, and they walk on their back feet like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one value of two, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary figures - or bits, in computer language.
Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the old familiarity with Baqb, which are very suitable insects as human parasites.
Both the assassin-bugs and the Bed-bugs are innocuous, suitable for living in a nest or in their host's location.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main objective of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method.This method actually guides much of scientific research.
However, it is not alone, experimentation, and experimentation is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to make questions, and to make observations is also a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language was diminished, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely answers to external periodic indications, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological meters are self-supporting oscillators that will continue a free running cycling period even without external indications.
Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to bring their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments by marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the mutation type, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Mutations only in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities on the ground include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and ecosystem information study.
An example of this is to visit, take photos, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns of the country with cars to go to work and pass by other people whose place of work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone, in some way, is linked to, and supports, a private car-based transport system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems create such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and their interactions.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult as driver behaviour cannot be predicted with a certainty of one hundred percent.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented approximately mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to start flying, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back in place along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold back their wings are the hammer and the mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth is not feeling moving, isn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the World, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the World, with a width of six miles at some points.
In total, 20 percent of all water from the Amazon is poured from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles).It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, Giza pyramids remained the largest in size and the best in the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were marvellous at the monuments of their predecessors who, at the time, were more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican City population is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its official legislation and communications.
The Italian language is also the daily language used by many of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have long known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper from antiquity, as they can all be discovered in nature in indigenous form and it is relatively simple to mine them through modular tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the theory that everything is made up of one or more of four elements: land, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also theorizes that they are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
The alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You may also have an alloy containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly miniscule that trillions of them stand at the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, pencils were relegated to lower status and less use.
People now write text messages on computer screens, and they never have to approach an anthem.
Who knows what the keyboard will become when something new is invented.
The fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy to connect a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a similar way as when pushing a heavy cart on an ascent. The splitting of the nucleus again then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to break with little effort.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust.The outer layer of the Moon is called the shell.
The shell is about 70 km wide on the nearest side and 100 km wide on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the "maria" and thicker under the "highlands".
There may be more moon waters on the nearby side because the shell is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centred on finding what makes people happy or attract them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalised when they mature to adulthood.
These theories analyse what makes certain people want the things they want and what things in their environment are going to force them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the Maslow Hierarchy Theory of Needs and the Hertzberg Two Factors Theory.
Generally, two types of attitudes can arise when managers start managing their former peers. One end of the spectrum is to try to keep feeling like one of them.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary action, carry out evaluations, assign responsibilities, and make people responsible.
On the other side of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognized individual who should change each team and mark it as his own.
After all, the head is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a conventional team as their teams may meet according to varying time zones and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports.The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the process of taking so much time to set up a learning organisation? One of the objectives for putting the concepts of learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organisation's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together of an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuous Sequence approach as a method being used to help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical proof of the theoretical approach to cognition investigation.This therefore makes the field of research less vast and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
For a long time it has been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies enables us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customers' diagnosis and questions, as well as recognition of calligraphy, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering and military, as it has been built into various applications of home computer software and video games.
On-site trips are a big part of every class.A teacher often likes to take her students to places where there is no possibility to go by bus.
The technology offers the solution with virtual on-site trips. Students can look at museum artefacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a trip on the ground virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the website is changed again, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing.Although students often start their blog experience with grammar and spelling is not good, having an audience usually leads to this situation changing.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer starts working to improve writing so that it is not criticized.
Also blogging "makes students learn more about the world around them." The need to meet the interest of the audience inspires students to be more up-to-date and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students will be able to define their positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the incandescent and bilingual capital of Canada and contains a range of art galleries and museums depicting the past and present of Canada.
To the south is Niagara Falls and to the north is the unexploited natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what is considered as Canadian by foreigners.
Larger areas to the north have a rather scarce population and some are areas in a natural state almost uninhabited.
For a comparison of the population that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest one, and a continent for him when we talk about wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling says that she is married, no matter what her current state regarding marriage.
It is also useful to wear a ring (not one that seems to be expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider to be harassment and it is not uncommon to be pursued, secluded, etc.
Be strong when you reject men, and don't be afraid to insist on your preference (whether there are cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean you have to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenides used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese broke it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and was renamed "Casablanca" by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to buy all over Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina, it is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as taines, pottery goods, leather goods, hookahs, and a full spectrum of geegas, but all are tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was ravaged by the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, in particular the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to know the state of fighting that persists in northern Kivu province.
The city is also the basis for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a taxi motor to turn into a Goma.The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese franc for a short turn.
Together with its relative lack of accessibility, "Smoking" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special series "Wonders of the African World."
The city contrasts strongly with the other cities of the country, because it has more Arabic than African elements.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is northeast of South Africa and passes along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is spread over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, and each contains different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, daily conservation and entry fees are applied.
It may also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which provides income for either park selections in South Africa or for all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The deployment of the Hong Kong skyline building has been compared to a light-emitting bar chart due to the presence of the Victorian Harbour waters.
To have the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on land advertised on the north shore.
This is the place that British settlers have taken as their own and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove forest in the world, 80 km (50 miles) long from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves in wetlands - they include some of the last remaining positions of imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered with water/wet areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary of wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 dotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station between the districts (through the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is recommended that the ticket be purchased a few days in advance.
Several districts contain small Japanese Coaster Buses services, which are comfortable and sound.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby locations, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapack River Bridge is a cabled bridge across the Oyapack River to connect the cities of Oiapque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapack in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical gap under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region included other indigenous tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, which survived by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "Giant Province of Indies", was born as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period of three centuries.
Since the Asunción foundation in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known as having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo camps in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Association Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Finnish pound (FPK) the value of which is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley adjacent to FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere in the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the external islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although the British and US currencies may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to see what is an acceptable method of payment.
Almost impossible to change the currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located in the South of the Equator, there is summer when the Northern Hemisphere is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go down under freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to feel colder than the one indicated by the thermometer.
There are no particular seasons "with rain" and "dry": the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals still remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how docile the bison, elk, moose (large North American deer), bears, and almost all animals that are large can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the proper distance.These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, thus giving them their space.
However, you should know that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the field clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, which is located on the island of Upulu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the mid-19th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the place where the infamous naval conflict took place in 1889 where seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the fight for independence organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the killing of head Tupua Tamasse Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, as Auckland lies between two ports, the most well-known being in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and start from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and the majority have the shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Port of Waitemata, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the Auckland Centre.
These are sandy beaches for the family that are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines you can find, but New Zealand and Australia wines are likely to travel better.
Local drinking tap water, but easily find bottled water if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of coffee called "flat white" is unfamiliar. "Short black" is "expresso", a capuchino is filled with plenty of cream (not foamy), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is in accordance with Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but it is excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, you should take advice from the authorities, follow all the signs, and pay close attention to the safety messages.
Box-shaped jellyfish is found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.Sometimes it can also be seen outside these times.
Although sharks exist, they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of the people and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If you book in advance, the traveller will have a restful mind that he/she will have somewhere to sleep upon arriving at his/her destination.
Travel agents often make agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages including breakfast, transport arrangements for/from the airport and even packages combining flight and hotel.
They may also hold the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any amendments or requests shall pass to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those who go to music festivals decide to camp on the spot, and many of them consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the close action you must arrive early to have a camping site close to the music.
Remember that although music on the main stages may have ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue playing music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're going to cross the North Baltic in winter, see the cabin's location well, because when you get through the ice a horrible sound will come out for those most affected.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximise the time and money guests spend there are usually no windows and clocks and it can be difficult to find exits.
They usually have food, drinks and special entertainment offers, to keep guests in a good mood, and to keep them on the spot.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, however, drunkenness hinders judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of remaining sober.
Anyone who will drive at high latitudes or across mountain passes should consider the possibility of having snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with snow and ice, there is not much friction and you can't drive as if you were on a naked asphalt.
During the intense snowstorms, you can get enough snow in a short time to get stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow falling or flying or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the main point of many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to land travel for the observation of African wild and fantastic animals, particularly in savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and close to standard equipment that allows good views.
Lions, cysts and leopards are sometimes scattered and you see them better with binoculars.
On foot safari (also called "bush walk", "yellowing on a hike ("hiking safari"), or "going footing") consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24th August to 5th September 2021, and some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, as it has already hosted matches in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before announcing the postponement, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and typical tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have iron and a board to pass on available to use, even if you don't have one in the room.
If iron is not available, or if you do not want to wear pasted socks, you can try to use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric become too hot (which may cause it to become drunk, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, a few of them more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, if boiling water for one minute is sufficient, several minutes are needed in others.
The filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a company that has a good name.
Travellers can meet unscrupulous animals with whom they are not familiar in the regions where they live.
The pests can ruin food, cause irritation, or in a worse case cause allergic reactions, give poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duty in certain places.
Travellers moving to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it often passes through isolated backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on the streets of the countryside, be careful: there is a predominance of steep hills, narrow lanes and steep turns.
The maximum speed limits are notably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict obedience is even more important than otherwise.
However, curiously, mobile service is much more powerful here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, and cooked apples are used in pastries all year round, and cherries and plums start in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.The well-known cakes often go well with a healthy cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try those that by region are called Berliner, Pfankuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a spice-based dish, along with meat or vegetables.

As there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term covering the large variety of regional cooking found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main Java island.
Japanese cooking, which is now widely available in the archipelago, includes a range of simple seasoned dishes, and the prominent favourite flavors of the Javanese are peanuts, chilis, sugar (especially the coconut sugar of the Javanese) and various aromatic herbs.
Staff are support for rider's feet hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety issues due to the potential for the rider's feet to stick to them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has a foot trapped in the staff, it can be dragged if the horse escapes.In order to reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth, rather narrow heel and sole.
Next, some saddles, in particular British saddles, have safety rods that allow the staff leather strip to be detached from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley (Wied Cochamó) - Chile's main climbing destination, known as South American Yosemite, with several large granite and rock walls.
The highest points include spectacular views from the peaks, with climbers from all parts of the world continuously setting new routes among its endless potential of walls.
Downhill ice sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve slipping down on snow-covered land on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Ski is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan full holidays around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old — cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates from at least until the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called "backcountry ski", "ski touring" or "ski hiking".
It is related to, but generally does not involve, touring of skiing or climbing mountains of alpine style, where the latter takes place on steep terrain and requires much tougher skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than you would walk - but it is only very rare that you will have the cross country ski speeds without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it contains many independent countries, usually, to travel from several countries you will have to go through visa applications and passport checks several times.
The Schengen area, however, works somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as it remains in this area, you will generally be able to cross borders without passing through the checkpoints for passport verification again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money and documentation.
There is no universal definition for which goods manufactured are antiques.Some tax agencies define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar items produced in mass.
Reindeer rearing is an important living among Sámi and culture around commerce is also important for many people who have other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in the large-scale farming of reindeer, but lived out of fishing, hunting and the like, and had reindeer mostly as animals to draw heavy weights.
Today many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.

Severe weather is the generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause harm, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rain, and fires in uncultivated areas are severe weather types and effects, such as thunderstorms, air binoculars, sea binoculars, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include strong ice storms, ice husks, ice storms, and duststorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who organises a visit to a country that may be considered as a war zone must carry out professional training.
An Internet search for a "hostile environment course" is likely to upload a local company address.
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course is usually from 2-5 days and involves role play, much first aid training and sometimes training in the use of weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but there are not too many publications about war zones.
Travellers planning a surgical operation for a sexual reassignment abroad must ensure that they are carrying the valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the undeclared gender (X) or up-to-date documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Pre-operational transgender people should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The crossing currents (rip currents) are the flow that returns from waves that cut off the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and can form a fast current for deep water there.
Many deaths occur due to fatigue after trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it is not more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to target where you are not caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you may prefer to wait for the rescue.
The re-introduction shock precedes the culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and may be stronger.
Travellers who have found it easy to adjust to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of your culture habits.
When you first moved, people probably took patience and understood you, knowing that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers to return home.
The sound and light display of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things on the children's side.
You can see pyramids in the dark and see them in silence before the show starts.

The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most base, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the Peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the colonisation of Villa Las Estrelas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula mountains here join in the plain, then go out again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided into two by the glacier of Minnesota.
The northern part or Sentinel range has the highest Antarctica mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, the satellite phone may be your only choice.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as it must be outside with a clear satellite view to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need to communicate at a distance by voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
A choice that is becoming more popular among those planning a year of study breaks is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year before entering university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during a year of abroad interval can actually improve your chances of progressing towards higher education back in your country.
There will typically be tuition fees to register in these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for shipping.The "Land of a thousand lakes" (the Land with a thousand lakes) also has thousands of islands, lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kajak offer a different experience.
Shipping is a national hobby in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one for every forty).
Most of the distinguished Cruises inside the Baltic include an extended visit to St Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for about two days while at night returning and sleeping on the ship.
If you leave on land only using on-board excursions you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in the brochures.As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.

It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not different from the personal fears and aversions that many people have for other things.
For some, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome fears that are based on what they do not know or on things beyond their control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering goods quickly. Often, time is very important in the case of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there has been a problem.
If they have sent goods by air, in some routes it may take days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to pass it more quickly was to ship it as checked baggage.The airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger, and here's where you are.
The obvious way to fly in the first class or business class is to issue a thick bunch of money for the privilege (or, so much better, connect your company to do it for you).
However, this would not be cheap: as approximate rules, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for the business (business class), and eleven times for the first class (first class)!
Generally, it makes no sense to look for discounts for business class and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain important group of air travellers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charging for these things.
The capital city of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.

Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Don't do on-site vandalism by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish, with roughly half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most people understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only marked in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.

Plitvice Lakes natural park is covered with many trees, mainly beech trees, spruce and firs, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a significantly wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes.

Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete nowadays, and remain as museums, or educational places.
As light pollution at their best was not the type of problem we currently have, they are generally found in cities or campuses, and it is easier to reach them than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The display of cherry blossom, known as "hanami", has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossom was the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor for himself and for other members of the aristocracy only around the Imperial Court.
Plants appear at their best when they are in a natural environment, therefore, resist the temptation to remove even one "only one" sample.

More traditional churches often organise a Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the weekend of Easter, and congregations often start celebrations at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived in the islands came here by swimming, flying or flotation.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the trip and therefore the giant turtle became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark all the time.
As areas have a low population, and light pollution therefore often does not cause problems, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than that of the Western people.
Suits are standard work clothes, and colleagues call each other with their surname or work titles.
Harmonization in the workplace is crucial, with a focus on the group's effort and not on encouraging individual achievements.
