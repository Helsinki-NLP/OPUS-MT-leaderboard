AMs from Wales are afraid to "be seen as foolish"
There is a consternation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was raised because of plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament's assembly.
The AMs around the political spectrum are concerned that this will make them appear ridiculous.
M Labour said that his group was concerned that "it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the language of Wales twp means filth and pwp means sawt.
Plaid's AM said the whole group was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A conservative from Wales said his group had an "open mind" about name changes, but noted that there was a slight verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of what should be called Assembly Members will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 act empowered the Welsh assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that had broad support for the assembly to be called a Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching a consensus can be a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how to be called when they have a debate on the legislation.
In Macedonia they leave public opinion in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was established with the aim of resolving a dispute that lasted for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbor represents.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a plebiscite opponent on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the consequence of entering the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Stop Playing as Churches in Harlem Send
Historically, the elders I spoke to say that there was a bar and church in every corner,” said Mr Adams.
Today, there is no.
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People socialize differently" today.
Bars are no longer the centre of activity of the locality where people go on a regular basis.
As for the churches, he is worried that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders are thinking, "and sooner or later they will end up where they were at the beginning."
He added that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks with condoms filled with the type of people who will not help the rest of the locality's shrines.
The vast majority of people buying condominiums in this building will be white carnage," he said, "and thus, they will not get bored when the day comes that they are created for these churches because most of these people who enter these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of white people - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of white-cargoers departed in the 30s.
A congregation of black people practicing nearby religion took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a congregation of black carrots under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers at 125 Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted the hiring or promotion of black carrots.
A fire in 1939 left the building seriously damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and successor of St. Martin's, was proud to call the carillon "the bells of the people."
The expert who performed the carillon in July called it something else: "Cultural treasure" and "single historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to have a black-caring musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not change with someone else.
What has happened in St. Martin's during the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some introduced by lay church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The 'vestry' - the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "will seek to pass on the expenses" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors who sent it from the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy during a boat trip to California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before the 7th morning at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then went to him with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the thrill of having to catch a lobster, but then “I realized he was shouting, ‘Bidni!
My bite!"
She'd cut him and opened all the clavicula to him," Hammel said he realized the moment he got to where the boy was.
I cried out so that everyone would get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
They took the child by helicopter to Radio Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with similar rack corridors to those of a department store of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial revenue in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household goods decline, larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the idea will be spread in more shops next year if it is successful.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on shelves that was once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the amount of beauty items it is offering up to 3000 items, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees will have more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are fit for vegans - something that is increasingly demanded by smaller buyers.
In addition, the retailer of fragrance Fragrance Shop will examine concessions in two stores of Sainsbury's, which the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying with small amounts of food every day in local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the shops will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight against shops servicing Aldi and Lidl's prices with more services and a non-food product.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos shops in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought the two chains two years ago, which says it has strengthened the sale of groceries and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous supermarket's attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a fight over how to split the revenues from the pharmacy stores into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit every need and the convenient setting of shops means that we have become a destination of beauty products of interest that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is "very angry" after Holly Willoughby cancels a £11 million deal
Dragons Den Peter Jones' personality "very angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled a £11 million deal with his lifestyle firm business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for the home products and accessories firm, Truly.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' personality Den Peter Jones very angry because she cancelled out being part of their last-minute life-style firm business - to focus on her big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say Jones was "very angry" when the popular television personality admitted to a tense meeting on Tuesday at his huge business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that there was not enough time left to dedicate it to their home and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop's firm and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she was leaving with Really, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private villagers.
A source said: "Verty was by far Holly's first priority.
It would be her long-term future that would fill the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely amazed.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost over.
There is a store full of produce at the Marlow headquarters that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, located among Britain's profit-making personalities, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothes and household products, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And it can mean an end to a long friendship.
A mother of three children, Willoughby and her village Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
Couples travel together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador of M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
Yesterday evening, a source close to Jones said "We don't comment on his economic affairs."
A difficult meeting "but then we found love"
He joked about criticism from news media for commenting that some people consider "non-presidency" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a voice imitating that of a "news presenter".
I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump bragged that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea would not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, note, the United States is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his manifestation speech.
He said, "We are moving well with North Korea".
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, help in the relief of hostages and the return of American veterans who were left behind.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
It is very easy to be a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this arena full of people, we would have around 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly before him.
tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia Destroy Island, Kill Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not necessary.
Even after more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had to move from home, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is challenging," Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign staff can operate on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesperson of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
In view of the frequent earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country is not yet well prepared for the great wrath of nature.
While shelter from the tsunamis was built in Aceh, you can hardly see them along the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alert serene in Palu, despite issuing a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok for the care of the victims is on their way to Palu, but it will last at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the upgrading of the falling infrastructure of Indonesia, the centre of his electoral campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration sent in for the lack of funds as it faces his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions still in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have had to move from home as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the street, using machinetes, archery and arrows and other types of weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge gets the same points in the last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was 27 metres from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
Slowly hit the ball left before shooting the ball into the gun.
The ball flew up much of the box as it entered the top right of the net.
Eventually, the ball went down after Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped to try to welcome him, and fell into the net.
I was trying to get into that position, to get in for the ball and players like Shaq always send it forward as much as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming on me and touching the ball once and I didn't think much about it and I tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 by the middle of the match after getting a goal in 25 minutes from the very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.
Chelsea's striker handed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before he left to run towards the middle of the pitch and then quickly entered the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic passes the ball quickly in the middle of the pitch.
Then he fired the ball in a very nice way, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran further than the players in the defence and sent the ball to the left foot net and crossed through where Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli at the Champions League group stage on the following Wednesday afternoon at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton at the UEFA Europa League on Thursday afternoon in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people were reported trapped under the rubble of a building that collapsed due to the 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet high, a spokesperson from the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was full of debris from the collapsed building.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was killed with a knife
An investigation was launched after a woman's body was found at Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found on 7.55 this morning with wounds from a knife at Grayson Mews in John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area to see or hear something to talk about.
Brian O'Hagan, investigative inspector, said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to everyone, particularly taxis drivers, who may have taken something on the videos with the dashcam to contact us as it may have information that is vital to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found her body is from Birkenhead and was found inside property.
Today afternoon friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police said they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to re-enter his apartment but is being informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He had no words when he learned what had happened.
Residents are being informed that there are still hours until they are allowed to re-enter.
A police officer has been heard telling one man that the whole area is being considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the spot with tears in her eyes.
She continues to repeat "it's horrible."
At 2 o'clock there were two police vans inside the closed area and another van just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the enclosed area monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and quote a log 247 of 30 September.
The statue of the Cromwell Parliament becomes the last monument to be struck by the argument on the "rewriting of history"
Its abolition would be a form of justice appropriate to destruction in a way similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the British religious and cultural artefacts perpetrated by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The British 'iconoclasm' of civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the story of a figure who many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the middle conflict of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure who is known to represent one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Swine Killer Attacks and Kills a Chinese Farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead by a cut artery, covered by blood near a pen in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in hoggery' on 30 May 2005 in Xing of Qinghai Province, China.
In fact, he travelled with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he discovered a door for the pig stall nearby open.
He said that in the pen there was a pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him with his surname "Wu," as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up not to attack anyone, while the police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people attacking pigs have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man became critically injured.
A decade earlier, a 295-kg pig kept a Welsh farmer on his tractor until he expelled his animal.
After a farmer from Oregon attacked him and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "cause."
They're playing.
They bite, they are very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the south-east of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it walks on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and to the south-east of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mph, Category 1 Hurricane, on Sunday 5th morning, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a trough on the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward to the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa is approaching the California Baja peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm he will start pushing strong tropical humidity in the north-west direction of the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, a tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching trough creates a heavy rain spread in the south-east in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, flow of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rain rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially on most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread character of tropical rains.
It would not be a good idea to go out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring very local blowing winds and dust.
The 'through' will bring some rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
A total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can cause small flows of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of their rainy season region.
Some widespread tropical storms begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rains become more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there may be some sharp temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain rather warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic temperature differences from the U.S. Center on Sunday.
There is almost a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
Most of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from the South Plains to parts of the North-East.
New York City could rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be roughly 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast is pointing to high possibilities for temperatures above the average for the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's sitting
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accused of having committed a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking news of the last minute of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it is certain 100 percent that Kavanaugh babasha when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to get rid of her clothes when they were a party of post-secondary school level.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate witness, said that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was counting the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is an audience size similar to that for the decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full day's sitting, Nielsen said.
ABC was followed by 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, protesters from CNN and CBS cameras were apprehended on Friday morning and were shouting at him as he tried to board the elevator for a sitting of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood there with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a live broadcast on CNN.
I stand here before you," said a woman.
Do you think you are telling the truth to a country?
They said to him, "You have power when many women have nothing."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before closing the doors of the lift, that he will have more to say at the committee hearing.
All the cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting live, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee in the following week, which the Democratic minorities have long encouraged.
Flake was partially convinced of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several years later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was empowered, as it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "taking advantage of politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union that they are "taking advantage" of politics and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May reached the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In a subsequent interview with her on the newspaper's front page, former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed on his attack of the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely crazy."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the shooting who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reporting the CBS affiliate, WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said they had admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying that the cause of death is damage from a gun head to neck.
The department is granting credit to the clandestine task force of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the enforcement of the area's law for "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2-metre-long striker was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "lost" and "under shock" after Wayde's death.
This is what you worry about all the time," said Wade.
Volcano throws ash on Mexico city
Ash being thrown away by the Popacepetl volcano reached the southern area of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention has warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the craters increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring various sounds and tectonic movements.
Images on social media showed thin ash layers that swept the car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists noted an increase in activity in the 45 mile (72 km) south-east of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 in central Mexico in September 2017.
The "Don Goyo" volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote to polarize the succession.
A pro-separatists group with covered surfaces that were held back by riot police threw the eggs and dusty paints, creating a cloud of dark dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also small clashes during the day and the police had to use batons to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, pro-independence groups were shouting "Do not forget, do not excuse" fighting against unionist protesters shouting, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries received in the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remained high in the region which wants independence a year after the 1 October referendum considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalonian separatists.
Voters chose with a large gap to become independent, although participation was low with those against the secession who made a big boycott against the vote.
According to the Catalonian authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said that there was no hope in Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
Last year we lived one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my mother and my father crying with joy that they could vote, but now he blamed us," he said.
Despite a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties are sending to maintain the momentum this year with many of their well-known leaders either in exile or in detention and waiting for the process due to the role they played in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
There is more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of Catalonia's nine leaders in prison before the end of last year's trial, announced that he will contest in next year's European Parliament elections.
By standing as a candidate for the European elections it is the best way to denounce the backlash in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry home more than once.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the grades and buildings themselves.
A crossbow could also have been used to shoot at the car at some point.
Menga's Goal is to win a 1-0 match for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won the game
Livingston, who was promoted, swallowed Rangers and thus Steven Gerrard lost for the second time in 18 matches as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's ball shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side equalled Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has not won once off the Premiership stadium this season and next Sunday it will be playing against the first eight-pointed Hearts.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna on their stadium in the Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continue not to have a loss in division in six matches, with head coach Holt who has not yet lost a game since it replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lose opportunities against bulky visitors
Holt's team should have long been winning before he had a goal, with his direct playing style causing a lot of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but crossed the ball in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only widely pass the ball after being slid off to receive the ball from Craig Halkett from next to the goal.
Those playing on their own pitch were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they were able to give them problems at certain moments.
And that was the way in which the crucial goal arrived.
Rangers allowed a free-kick to enter and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and brought him in the goal from the centre of the box.
By that moment, Rangers were dominating possession of the ball, but were finding the defence of the team playing on their own pitch, not penetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That style of play continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos made Kelly welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman failed to find a goal because of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow fired the ball widely after distributing another Livingston player to him.
Balls were constantly entering the Livingston box and were always removed by their players, while two requests for a penalty - following Halkett's attempt to replace Glenn Middleton, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
Phenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in the arena Tony Macaroni
Performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed expectations on this trajectory going up.
The style of play and their staff have not changed much from the return to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way he has joined the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett's head was very big in his games, organising a very well organised defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worall with seven eyes.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerrard, there was a lack of standards this time around.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - once only they managed to divide the defence team he was playing on his own pitch - and it's a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne.
On Saturday (29 September), people laughed and heard blue as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - with the aim of repairing relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many people supporting it came close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also voiced their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept them in the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is hero to certain German Turkish and thought to be autocrat by others.
Road crash in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at the collision of 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
This incident happened a few months later after another cyclist died after hitting a car and going to Children Street, about a mile from last Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and diversions of buses are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Latin Prison: Six officers injured in disorder
Six prison officials have been injured following a high-security man's prison disturbance, the prison office said.
The disruption began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialised officials "Turnado" were introduced to address the disorder, which involves eight prisoners and is located in one of the sections.
Officials were treated for minor injuries to their faces on site.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address an on-going incident in Long Lartin HMP.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Martin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who have committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-riot officers were called to prison to address a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threats Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city with Rapid Flood (Drought Areas Can Benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa moves from the southwest to the desert, leading to risks of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already established a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona to the South and East of Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line from Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Arizona Mogollan Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have from 1 to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa rain can be a positive thing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the south-west side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring device, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category,” reported by weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa led to the arrival of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still be a very strong hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and thus loses strength.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rain in parts of Mexico can be severe, posing a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches,” reported by weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and will then move from Arizona and south of Utah until late in the evening on Tuesday.
The main danger expected by Rosa or her remains is heavy rain in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and in the southwest desert of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening rapid flooding and crushing flows in deserts, and landslides on the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured at Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
They took him to hospital where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old adolescent, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, police said.
The officers appealed to anyone who could have a video shot from their phone of what happened to speak.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "sent the greens and anger" of the Democratic Party.
A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "sent the greens and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, the "American people saw Kavanaugh's bravery and quality and courage".
A vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most impeccable legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable public service record," he told the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not contesting, but in truth, I'm contesting," he said.
That's why I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates."
Trump has argued that Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, rising death toll
At least 384 people have been killed, many have crashed as huge waves hit beaches, after a large earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres (18 ft) fell by force on the ground when it began to darken, while many carried and died and everything was destroyed that was in the middle.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not wake up to happen immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency spokesman BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not appear on its own, pulling cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled along the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the shore.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that surrounded themselves and collapsed and a water surrounded mosque.
Strong shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by the week's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the geography of the city, located at the edge of a long and narrow beach, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally sent and without information" by Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” they said from the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticised for not informing that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the wave had arrived at the time the alert was issued.
In a video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building may be heard shouting anxious warnings for the tsunami approaching people on the lower road.
Within a few minutes, a huge amount of water fell on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the videos immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe outage which reduced communications across Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military started sending cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived in the city of Palu, where employees are sheltering armed tarpaulins in their office yard, they went through scenes of devastation on their way there, said Mr Doseba.
He said, "They told me that they saw many houses destroyed."
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups began the unpleasant process of disaster relief, some complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start to enter if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
It is still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can bring international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami, the friends and family of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that embellished this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child came out of the sewerage.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was trapped under the rubble for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, the manager of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Other of those caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr Gendon explained how, in the hours after the announcement of the fall of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival.
His messages, however, only marked that they left, but did not mark that they had arrived.
I think that means that the messages have not arrived," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 while ATM was being refilled at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was re-filling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While in employment, another man "comes from behind the Brink's employee" and stole a cash bag intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap singer changes his name to Ye
The rap singer Kanye West is changing his name - for Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change takes place ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces Ariana Grande's singer on the program who canceled for "emotional reasons," the programme's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
I believe that "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year, while discussing his album's title with the Big Boy radio presenter.
So I, you, I am, it is us.
From Kanye which means 'the only one', to Ye only - simply a reflection of what we have good, bad, what confuses us, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of a number of famous rap singers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who collaborated with West, JAY-Z, he also served with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatellco Square that "he will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops launched a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing around 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funds for I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says the investor and practitioner of the AI Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made AI announcements, even if there is a lack of a formal AI strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are much further behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough step in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the big achievement of the next AI will take place in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the player with American Othello's highest rating, followed by an executive with Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognised previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Defence Research Project Agency Robotics Challenge and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said, "It's not China that is removing academic leaders; the corporations are doing it,."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen their efforts in AI.
He said, "I believe that the green card should be offered automatically to people who have a Doctorate in AI".
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations spend money on US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month Darpa announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen any action in several months.
Macedonian people vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a step that resolves a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a possibility of possession of its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: "You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there had been no reports of irregularities up to 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Goose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the Macedonian referendum on the change of name of the country giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and preparing seats in front of the armed tents by those who would boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we have to enter proudly under our conditions, not with the command of others" said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If we do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a result in favor of the name change would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below that of the necessary participation.
Another survey, carried out by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, participation must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it would represent a serious first blow to government policy in favour of Western ideologies from the moment it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes through Brighton's entire defence for a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute seem very easy.
The Argentine striker received a ball from the middle of the pitch at the start of the sequence.
He ran from three Brighton defenders before moving into an open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green vests.
He fought with one defender before escaping much more from the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he crossed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute Aguero, who used the right foot to bring the ball to the right side of the net by passing through where Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
Aguero is sending problems to his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That has happened.
We had the good luck of having made a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
That goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball very inward into Brighton's territory in that action.
He sent the ball right to Leroy Sane with the left side in a very nice way.
Sane touched the ball a little before leading Sterling to the goal.
The Sky Blues striker touched the ball a little and entered the net just before landing in a territory he is not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in spoiler vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility to compete in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But so competitive Scherzer hopes he will be able to be the pitcher on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive match, which are ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one match.
The Rockies managed to gain a chance to continue competing with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still seeking a first title of the division.
Although we are playing for nothing, we may at least have the possibility to win by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What would you not want to compete in those circumstances?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer be the pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for the 34th time, held a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is generally resting.
The player from Washington who plays with his right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's Manifestations in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation relating to the choice for his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
In November, everything we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is very big -- I'm not contesting, but in reality, I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates," he said.
We are seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we are seeing it happening now,” Trump continued.
And they are determined to take back power by using every possible means, you can see the green.
They don't care about those who hurt, those who want to fly in order to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give them."
He said the Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
And I've seen this over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "irritated and green and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senator classified in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, and received a lot of negative shouting from the audience.
Do you remember her response?
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, and no, I expect, first of all - the movements of his body were not positive at all - the worst movements I have ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
Don't tolerate those who communicate their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I didn't take it very seriously.
After all, I am the most recent MP on a list of Labour Party MPs who were not positively welcomed - because we communicated our opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censure is critical because it did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Council of Friday evening were exactly so.
Unfortunately, today it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more merciful and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if, in fact, it has never started in the truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view expected to change my mind and take positions I would never agree with in other situations - whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in reality, it doesn't matter what I say - I happen to me with an abuse of social media with a request to remove me from my office as MP, they denounce the centre's policy, and tell me that I don't have part of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I was more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a lot of sexual or racist abuse every day but never hide from the comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with any motion of "lack of confidence" or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that has encouraged me to keep my opinions to myself, so that I'm not so vocal and then everything is "good."
But I did not go into politics to do so.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the negligence of Thatcher's government that left my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never been to politics, even in the past election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, everything I say is that when the country is moving towards Brexit that is going to damage our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether Labour Party members or not: I am proud to work for you and promise you that no amount of threats that will remove me from my office or political expediency will deter me from acting in those who believe that they are all your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who has not yet lost once, climbs on top in the ranking
Two attempts could change the outcome slightly, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this exciting game of the Tennt's Premiership day.
They are currently the first in the ranking, the only team of all ten who have not lost once.
Ultimately, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to profit from the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing on his own pitch, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
We've been through trials during our matches so far, and we haven't lost one yet, so I'm happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "Give credit to Ayr, they have profited from the better opportunities from us."
With Grant Anderson's attempt in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from Scotland's head Roy Hughes, who was allowed to play the game by Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's victory with a penalty, before, in the middle of the match, he just made a goal and converted an individual attempt to bring the points 17-5 to Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap by 5 points.
Then the game stopped due to serious injury to Ruaidh Knott, who came out of the pitch on a stretcher, and as soon as the game resumed, Ayr continued to take the points after an attempt by Staford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr Blair Macpherson's chief agent was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose came up with an aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team he was playing on his own pitch started attacking again, and when he was given a yellow card Struan Hutchinson for the action he made on Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson touched the ball with the back of the Ayr group which was advancing.
Climo converted, as he did almost once again from the area from which the game resumes, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball that David Armstrong met from the box and sent Gregor Henry, who plays side by side, to the fifth attempt of the side that she was playing on her own pitch.
Still Game's personality seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Ford Kieran's personality appears ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that it was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old, who plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular programme, writes and takes part in it with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last of the programme, and Kienan seems to be planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the director of Adrifthorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun hinted that Kienan was seeking to engage in Glasgow's "very good restaurant trade".
The sea is ours": Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen a passage for the Pacific
Seafarers stay watchful of naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Across Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the lost coastline to Chile in a bloody conflict of 19th century resources remains clear - as Bolivians wish to sail in the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive view,” said Roberto Calzadilla, diplomat of Bolivia.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the ICJ on large screens all over the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet for the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - facing a controversial re-election battle next year - also has much to lose in Monday's decision.
We are very close to having access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and that it will change little if it does so.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ judgment is received only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And far from favoring the case of Bolivia, the last four years may not have been helpful.
The issue of access to the sea was seized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' hostile rhetoric weakened any residual goodwill of Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions thereafter.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons is the first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to deliver on its promises made at a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments were echoed as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to have resumed nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore joined North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a hope in the emptiness" that the continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to give up.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree to the statement without Pyongyang undertaking significant first steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the coming month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of massive headgear that will soon appear in the main shops.
If you want to add to your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of strange and very large headwear for their Spring and Summer 2019 collection on the runway that embellished the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats are appearing a lot on Instagram this summer and these designers have uploaded their surprising creations on stage.
The object that mostly represented Valentino was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a feather-like edge that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other very large size accessories included jewel-coated watermelons, silk hats and even pineapples - but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks had the lips sewn and resembled Hannibal Lecturer rather than a haute couture.
One creation resembled the diving apparatus complete with snorkels and goggles, while another was like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with this good luck style.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge bonenets will soon appear in the main shops.
The big hats come out after the exit of La Bomba, the two-foot wide-edged straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The 'cult label' responsible for the unpractical hat that has appeared a lot on social media has brought another great creation to the stage - a straw basket that contains almost as much as the model wearing a mesh that it was carrying.
The dark orange raffia basket, surrounded by a small roughy string and a white leather handle, was the creation most prevalent in Jacques' Spring and Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
A famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I am looking forward to seeing big hats and bags in the main shops for the coming summer - as the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for the very large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, continuing in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only successfully individual and collective reinforced in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCII), strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages remain the subject of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If a man speaks a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If you speak in your own language, you will understand with your heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront of ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a higher A grade.
The data, collected from the 74 schools which are members of the SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who study German, 69 percent of those who study French and 63 percent of those who study Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a topic option, maintained in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Jobs and Skills in 2014 found that from reasons that gave employers for sending to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming more and more imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career to choose, if you learn another language, this will have a real advantage in the future as it will have the ability to last such a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation and, 15%, French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage.
That is why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages they can choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will equip children and equip them with the skills they need to be successful, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied at the moment, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
The faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to play for the first time with Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James' sports fans did not expect him to start for the first time for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lacquer manager Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game before the start of the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes you will play still needs to be determined.
It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers' journalist Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that, probably, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six matches before the Lakers season starts.
At this stage of my career I do not need pre-season games to prepare myself,” he said.
Trump's Manifestation in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign demonstrations tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first manifestation of five scheduled next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
At the moment is Trump's manifestation in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
Trump's manifestation in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trump's manifestation in West Virginia online below via live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to address this week's sittings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become intense due to allegations of sexual misconduct by an anticipated Senate confirmation vote suspended until one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary aim of this wave of manifestations is to help Republicans face the November elections to achieve some momentum.
President Trump's campaign thus said that these five demonstrations next week are aimed at "giving energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
The Congress Control is so important for this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as we approach the busy campaign season,” he told Reuters a spokesman for the Trump campaign that he refused to name his name.
Scheduled to the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the night show can gather fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday it will be the second time last month that Trump will have visited West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is missing out on the survey.
It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to boost the survey,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. Team determined not to give up while coming to Sunday's singles
After three sessions on one side, Saturday afternoon foursomes could have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a concept of fully invented sport but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do you say that the momentum is now?
They were in front with six points and are now with four, so I think we are carrying this as a bit of momentum,” Jordan Spieth said as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points in front with another twelve to be played.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel but have a few obstacles and have a lot to encourage them, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day long and each boast three points out of four.
Spieth was precise from tee to green and is leading by example.
That outcry from the heart of a celebration continued to grow as his round continued, making a crucial put to bring about a fourth equal match when he and Thomas were two out of two after two.
His putt that won the game over 15 was greeted by a similar cry, the kind that tells you that he believes the American team is still there.
True you have to go deep and worry about your own match,” said Spieth.
This is what is left of each of these players now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couple are four by four and are considered perfect.
Moliwood was the only pair who did not score a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday 9th afternoon.
That run, and the way in which their energy seems to move both to and from this lifetime crowd establishes that they are the players that are challenging Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun descends on Le Golf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at once on different holes.
But here we are talking about a European glory that is still early on for her.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly finished by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine brought Spanish and Swedish into a hole they had never managed to get close to leaving.
But on Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see because of the peer-to-peer interactions, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way a strategy can be turned into a second.
Europe has better played as a team so far and is at the forefront of the final day but this foursome session has also shown that the US Team has the determination that some, especially on the US side, have been questioning.
Europe in the lead with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches in front with 10-6 on the United States.
The inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins on Tiger Woods which found it difficult to take their score so forward in the Le Golf National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, ready to keep the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in the morning's fourballs, which took the series by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but could not come to the difference in score.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After dominating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then worked excellently to win Woods which did not appear to be optimistic and the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with an even more hematic score of 5&4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both matches on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for morning fourballs, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the 2&1 loss foursomes of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
But not everything came as Europe wished on a beautiful day, with a little breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a big winner three times, and Justin Thomas set the threshold for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They gained a 2&1 brave win over Jon Rahm and Spain's Ian Poulter in fourballs and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned from a four-point difference while entering the singles, although Furyk side's players need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, a Sunday counterattack appears to be more than it can do.
North Korea says it will "in no way" unilaterally disarm it without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions were deepening its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would unilaterally leave its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "considerable goodwill measures" last year, such as setting up nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated family complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea would have been rewarded as it takes gradual steps, its statement appeared significantly not to refuse unilateral denuclearisation without thinking as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists on "denuclearisation first" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, and even objects to the "end of war statement," Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who do not know about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the part of this denuclearisation issue were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
However, Ri's speech tone was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea rockets was inevitable after Mr. Kactive Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said a lot of work remains to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for this, saying "If it takes two, three or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realise fully verified and final denuclearisation."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with a view to halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, after North Korea criticised him for making "gangster-like requests" within hours.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all its undergraduate students sleeper with the aim of fighting macho culture that is growing to study all night and stay awake thanks to caffeine.
An academic has found that students at the university in the first place in the world often have no idea about the real basic things about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after speaking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally a girl came to me and said, "Why am I telling me this now, in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - to be surprised,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how traditions of good sleep help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students had serious insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a student sleeping room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance has an effect on sleep deprivation, and the routine importance of sleep time.
In another section, participants are told that prolonged insomnia can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that it won't change students' behavior right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - as much as you have a right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke cigarettes,” Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of being proud that "you have managed to stay awake all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep enough, and of good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid increasing weight, as sleeplessness puts the brain in a hunger mode, making them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all undergraduates to undertake a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm when they go to sleep, as well as when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted from electronic screens and LED light, which could unbalance your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal distracts Gerrard men
Rangers suffered another period of sadness when they played abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered Steven Gerrard's side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win while travelling from the February 4-1 triumphal win in St. Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his side eight points away from the big Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and Rangers' list of players devoid of inspiration never seemed to catch up.
While Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston rises to third and only after Hibernian on a goal difference.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently throwing an object from the supporters side of the team that played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side from Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained form has hindered their opponents continuously.
Rangers could have dominated the possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to score just two minutes from the start when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder took his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' strong free-kick then found the skipper Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow could only knock from the back.
Rangers gained control but it seemed that there is more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he had to have a penalty on the fifteen-minute mark as he and Steven Lawless beat but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the appeals of the Colombian.
Rangers managed to aim well only two shots in the first half of the match but former Ibrox Liam Kelly goalkeeper hardly worried Lassana Coulibaly's head blow and Ovie Ejaria's light strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34 minutes could have been when the other team was playing better, no one could deny that he was just fit for their effort.
Once again, Rangers did not manage a good set-piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher shoots the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to finish the action.
Gerrard reacted to the brake by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winger shoots in Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston went on to attract visitors to play just the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett catching a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could extend their lead position in the final stages but McGregor stood still to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went to the open from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late request for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: The Inventor of the Contactor of Geiger
And now a page from our Almanak of "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, as today 136 years old, and WE WE ARE counting... the day on which future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Contactor.
A science foundation since then, the Contactor of Geiger has also become a cornerstone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which unlikely cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear:
Man: "That's what the mammoth is?"
Rogers: "That Contactor of Geiger, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that give the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "It's definitely popular now!"
Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention by name survives.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are transformed into a laboratory
They can then “see” a protein common to many cancers and then be re-injected
A vaccine of the trial is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see' a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "boosts the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to immune cell uptake by patients and how to "learn" how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a verbal attack in favor of Trump, while wearing a hood of MAGA, after his appearance on SNL.
This isn't good
Kanye West was booted into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which US President Donald Trump praised and said he would stand for the 2020 election.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a make America Great beer, he began to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often speak to a white person and say: "How can you please Trump, the racist one?"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left America for a while,” he said.
SNL began the program with a comedy sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to laugh at West when he posted it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that they had caught him behind the scenes about his beer.
They blew me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't get out there with that hood."
Let's kill me!
Then they say it lost,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the lost? and he continued saying that he was going to "wear my superman's cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments were triggered at least twice by the audience and members of the SNL cast appeared embarrassed, reported Variety, with one person there saying to the publication: "In the studio as a whole, great silence fell.
West brought him as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confounded many with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the president of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: Thank you for standing up to the crowd."
But presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply “what it is and it is something extremely beautiful.”
But I didn't choose to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who believes he is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
We are so much more,” she added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "what was formerly known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the legend of music that is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist previously known as Prince.
Charge of attempted stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhachamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Kit Harington's star speaks of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO Game of Thrones' violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old spoke about the macho hero stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the boys often feel they want to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes something has gone wrong and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic maculinity in the #MeToo era.
A kit, recently married to his 31-year-old game of thrones Rose Leslie, also admitted that he has "strong interests" to address the issue.
Personally, I feel I have a strong interest, right now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?," he said.
What have we been teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its highly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
For it is very clear that something went wrong for the boys."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not make prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series arrives at the end of next summer, saying that "so many wars and horses".
As of November, Kit will feature in Sam Shepard's new True West production which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that when he met his wife Rose it was the best thing that emerged from Game of Thrones.
I have met my wife on this program, so this way she gave me my future family, and my life from here on,” he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series he won at Emmy.
The couple got married in June 2018 in Leslie's family estate land in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 around 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a shift from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spreading in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way had been reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be commonplace.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most disease transmissions come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member disclosed GOP senators' data, saying "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat ascertained that the claims were being spread by "ultra-right" bands and websites.
Lying, lying, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham's home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill at a sitting of the Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The revelation took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with the Waters office and released the information of a Waters staff member, reported the Hill.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie,” continued Waters.
My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This unfounded allegation is entirely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This denial is one of anger," Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that it does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It should not be resistant.
The defendant's pleas should not be called into question.
It must be calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused of critics appearing too angry at Thursday's sitting.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will stand to take the seat of Waters in the mid-term elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
This is a great thing if it is true,” he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned the "appropriate law enforcement authorities and bodies about these fraudulent claims.
We will ensure that the authors will be revealed,” he continued, “and that he will be held legally responsible for all their harmful and dangerous actions for each and all of my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, a powerful imitation of spying
It has become traditional now to look for the meanings of Brexit in any new film with a British perspective and this seems to be applicable to the return of Johnny English's imitation comedy franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is the ironic autosatira on the subject of how bad we obviously are, the country's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the big-eyed incompetent Johnny English and parts of his face that move unusual had the license renewed for the second time to do everything wrong - that name more than anything proves to be a widespread comical creation designed for territories of non-English speaking cinemaists.
Of course it is the stupid secret agent who despite his strange claims to his sweet charm has little by Closeau, a meeting of Mr Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the melody of the Chariots of Fire theme at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
It is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson once played his part in Barclaycard TV's commercials, today forgotten, after leaving chaos behind.
There is a good moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armoured dress and the propeller blades picked up his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy appears, but humor feels rather impoverished and too strange, especially since the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer comedy as an ingredient confidently.
The humor is as if aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the unfortunate strange incidents of Johnny English were not as inventive and focused as the jokes of Atkinson's speechless film in Bean's persona.
The perennial topical proposition is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's very secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cherry on the cake for the prime minister who is an impious figure and with difficulties, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political dispossession: Emma Thompson does her best with this character as Teresa May but there is not much in the script to work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone retired.
And this means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated operational: a little joke here as English offers a school of Rock-type spying academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former highly patient partner, Bough, once again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bogh is now a married man, with a submarine commander, who plays a role of a naked man interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in whom she is a little wasted.
So the two inseparable who always confuse everything in her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, when they encounter the character of a seductive and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the rule of the tech billionaire who claims that he can solve the problems of Britain's computer: minister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey of farce fun behaviour: dressed as waiters, setting fire to a high French restaurant, creating chaos to climb the luxury Volta yacht; and English starts a full anarchy as it tries to use Virtual Reality headsets to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's home.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as friendly and animated as it is, it has a little idea of a children's television.
Something quite moderate.
And like Johnny English's other films I couldn't but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role he really deserves for his talent?
Labour denies preparing a plan for the British to work a four-day week but is paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British work a week of four days - but they are paid for five.
Specifically, the party wants the company's boss to pass on the remnants of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them another day off.
This would see employees enjoying a weekend of three days - but still take with them the same pay.
Sources said the idea would be "appropriate" with the party's agenda and economic plans that the country favours.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight but a four-day working week is a fitting aspiration with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is currently not being approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "those who profit" in utility firms.
The plans of the opposition chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all their share as the Labour government may make a "reduction" on the basis of perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of private sector firms equity to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation can change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by one week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence a Republican senator from withdrawing his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked Scott Pelley if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Heh, and surely,” said Kennedy.
I said to judge Kavanaugh, and I spoke to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after he released that allegation, I said, "Have you done it?"
He was resolved, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems difficult to change.
It has already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and wants to be a very big charge,” he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And every person who mentions it cannot verify it.
It is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has It Done to Reduce Poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a very impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people set off for the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the real goal of the event of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a representation group in the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay a VIP ticket), the performers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or some other significant ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been with the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to ask for a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "liktivism" - people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, insisting on a number of different goals.
It says these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcement from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far made a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "help children grow to their full potential," with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice a footnote in history,” said The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on its website asking "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall down and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists who will feature at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deorra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. uses the Navy to "block" Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
If necessary, Washington may resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Secretary-General Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it is operating with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to address this.
The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market,” he said.
Zinke was addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that stars itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, to a greater or lesser extent, fuel leverage and replacement,” he said, referring to Russia as a "one-skilled" economy dependent on fuel-fuelled.
The statements come as Trump's administration was on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to exit the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas project, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow's "slaves".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gasket, which is expected to double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), invited the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Sweetly Examine" If You Get Out for President in 2020, Saying Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "test well" whether to stand for president after the mid-term elections.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider going out.
It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman in top position,” she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will carefully examine whether to go out for president.
Warren commented on President Donald Trump at the council meeting, saying he was "taking this country in the wrong direction."
I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nomination for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think they should stand for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "probable" voters said the senator should not stand for election, according to the Suffolk/Boston Globe University's Political Research Centre survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the election issue.
The survey showed more support for the exit from the previous Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting and 48 percent supporting an exit to the potential election.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in relation to a potential exit to the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he officially decides by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin's PTSD in the manifestation of Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September
He was arrested and brought on an incident of domestic violence on Monday night
What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returned, I can relate to other families who feel PTSD ramifications and some of the wounds our soldiers return to them,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said about her son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, they return stronger, they return to think about what other soldiers like them and air staff, and every other member of the military, gave the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was brought on a domestic violence attack on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support a challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal challenge for a new US policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts, on Friday filed a court case in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the actor in Grace's case against Sessions who brought the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the boy children members of his violent gang," had abused her but US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
It was held in Texas.
The state lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations are facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine, said the new policy "regards decades of state, federal and international law."
Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a plea violates this principle, the case of a court friend said.
Lawyers further argued that the policy of denying immigrants income harms the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths doubles in a fight against the time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more terrible.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said: "I feel very intense, while she was embracing a baby child with a fever in an evacuation centre in the unfortunate city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents appeared to return to their homes destroyed, searching for their belongings flooded with water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were too full.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a back and shoulder fracture, remained outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to continued strong shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he told that he felt the violent earthquake moving the hotel floor on the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
There was no chance to save ourselves.
I was crushed with the remains of the wall, I think,” Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in the place for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda adverts"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper released an advert on four pages in a daily U.S. newspaper seeking to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid-up China Daily supplement at the Des Moines Register - the newspaper that is mostly sold in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the US congress elections on 6 November, accusing China of denying it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in a campaign that is escalating from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a trade war that has seen them pass tariff rounds on the imports of each of them.
China's retaliation tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt US workers, farmers and businesses.
China has written Branstad on an opinion page at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubles this bullying by making propaganda ads in our own free press."
In spreading its propaganda, China's government is using America's cherished tradition of free expression and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
In contrast, on the newspaper stand down here in Beijing, you will find limited dissemination voices and you will not see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people can have on China's problematic economic trajectory, as the media is under restriction of the Chinese Communist Party,” she wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Disalign Female Voters Before the Mid-Term Elections with Kavanaugh's Debate, Warning Analysts
As many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while facing allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next mid-term elections.
The emotions on this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to lead by vote.
These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute thrust for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang "November coming!" as they protested in the Senate hall as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be of a very high level, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst to the news site.
People are saying that they were already high; and true.
But they may be higher, particularly between female voters who turn votes in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing its allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's nominee, analysts suggested that an adverse reaction could follow if the Republicans run with confirmation.
This has become a complete confusion for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
This does not only concern the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bench, it also concerns the way Republicans handled this situation and how they dealt with it,” pointed out to the news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somehow divided over believers in the light of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed definitely or probably Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they believed definitely or probably Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh while he was drunk attacked at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to start a new Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
A solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination."
We want to do it now,” he said about the new business.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This may contain contact lists, lists of what to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify have all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the online personal data store unique is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company brings adequate resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some developers in the contract staff to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
We are not asking for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am extremely optimistic for this next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only clergy of the Church of England to win Victoria Cross during World War I as combatants was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Kur The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A commemorative stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said he was "symbolically symbolic" that the stone was to be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award was won.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Kur led its battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a lot of fog and fire from field rifles and machine guns."
Later he rushed to the fire line and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before going to a rifle on the spot alone and losing consciousness three of the troops.
The Lt Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a girlnanda after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honoured to play a role in this parade" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being shown by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead of finishing with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been awake all night to see a packed Belator 206 to end up being deprived of seeing the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being displayed live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were amazed when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they remained awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One Twitter fan described the change to children's cardboard as "some sort of bulky joke."
It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was therefore inappropriate to switch to children's programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
Peppa the sow,” yes.
The president of Belator Scott Cooker said they will work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
I think that when I think about repetition, we can probably fix something,” Cooker said.
But now it is Sunday 6th morning and we will not be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
When the broadcast was over, there were a lot of messages going on and not all of them were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't a government issue.
I can promise you that the next time will not happen.
We'll limit it to five fights instead of six - as usual - and try to deliver more to supporters and instead we've gone too far.
It is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "poor" due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has grown to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this has motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he had not realized until he went to the side that "not everyone like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than" others as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to please boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those emotions that you feel less than, and you feel different, were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile promoter for LGBT and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt fortunate that he could live freely without ramifications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world winner said three times that when he fell in love with a man - a US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise" to him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age difference was never a problem.
Going through so many things at such a young age - he went to his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who was a beautiful and ugly experience like that.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
If I had asked me last year, the important thing for me was to "I want to win a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - as he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't say "you won't be here to be in the front row," he said.
I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead who finally acknowledged it wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I knew that this was what I dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a crowd from countries in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the first selection of his song - Heather Small's Proud - which was compatible with him on the run for the Olympics and is still blaming the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who is no longer in the form remains on the bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Saturday when he plays his 47 Ryder Cup games, but he will have to change his form to avoid being such a happy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays at the biennial event for a record 12-time record, remained on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the centre of action, as it was often for the United States, the big five-time winner shared his day between supporting him and working on his game from the distance in the hope of rectifying his concerns.
One who would never have given the ball right even in the fullness of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the difficult Le Golf National course, where the long distance revolves over and over again punishes mishandled shots.
And if the course alone is not heartbreaking enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, new to the season, to win all four of their matches this week.
If Americans, with four points less than the start of the 12 single games, start well, the game of Mickelson can prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say something else.
He fully understood the role he played today, taps on my back and places his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
It has a lot of confidence in itself.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see two games.
I have seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He wants to be outside, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached its full individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought a few intangible things to the team.
He laughs, sarcastic, funny, loves laughing with people, and a good man getting into the team room,” he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed criticizing him, this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides a lot more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn that the leading position can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizable front position before the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 match in Valderama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans but ended up with a narrow true margin, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 win.
She continues to remind herself that we had a great front position in Valderama; we had a great front position in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama, where we won, but with little,” said Bjorn, in the press, having seen the 2018 Class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be in the lead with 10-6 in Le Golf National.
This is why the story will show me and everyone in this team who has not yet finished everything.
Tomorrow you will go with your soul and body.
Get out there and do all the good things.
It hasn't finished all until you get the points on the team.
We have a goal, and what he is trying to win this trophy, and the focus will remain there.
I always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what the other side is - the biggest players in the world."
Happy with how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never go a step further than me in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
It is very nice to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you are out there individually, you will then be tested for your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass on to the players, to come out your best tomorrow.
Now, let your partner behind you and he wants to leave and come out his best, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposing number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than they did as partners, with the exceptions that are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the last days who could change everything, after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing as Europe did the "Marchicle of Medina."
I remember until the very least word,” he said in an answer when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to arrive at that start soon as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that momentum reaches one side, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We have drawn up our list accordingly and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we are trying to do some miracles tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Potter the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn said about his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing Cold War time frigades, but there will be at least not until next year due to systems with defects and increasing cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main vessel of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed for the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a spokesman for the military.
The vessel had to join the Naval Fleet in 2014, but the post-delivery problem issues have shattered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships that ordered the Navy back in 2007 will be replaced by ageing Bremen class fringes.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, an anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile display as well as some cautious technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markers.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newer frigade up to two years away from home ports.
However, a continuous delay means that the state-of-the-art vessels - which referred to allow Germany to project power abroad - will already be old by the time they enter the service, Die Zeit notes.
The F125 frigate of misfortune appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a vessel to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frigades.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel is severely overburdened to reduce its performance and limit the ability of the Navy to add future updates.
The "Rheinland-Pfalse" of 7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice as heavy as vessels of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the whole project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - from an initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest frigates become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy currently "has a lack of vessels capable of deployment."
The official said that the problem has grown over time, as old vessels have been commissioned but replacement vessels have not been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frogs could join the Navy.
The National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of bats
New ground research in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when searching for food.
It is hoped that the findings will show new light on the behaviour of single mammals flying and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common piestrelles and soprano as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bats activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of calls of bats and what species it is doing.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced that will create a detailed picture of their behavioural landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grazing and how best to keep woodlands for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development work affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as poison cards to capture insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not currently blind.
However, because of the traditions of their nocturnal game their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to indicate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nesting inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organisation even established the first and only reserve of Scotland's night butterflies on the Threeave floor in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of Scotland's ten night butterflies species.
Property manager David Thompson says that property is the ideal territory for them.
Here at Thrave we have a very good area for bats,” he said.
We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and the whole good habitat.
But there is much more about bats that is not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that unintentional destruction of a single maternity nest can kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly destroying an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bats Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we do not yet know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers ready to search for a German magazine
Ronaldo pointed out rape claims against him as "fake news," saying people "must promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are expected to seek the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The front-facing Portuguese and Juventus player has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he had paid her $375,000 on that day not to say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, remarked the reports as "fake news".
No, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” said Ballon d'Or's winner five times while he looked at the camera.
They must promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They have to become famous to say my name, but this is part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is going well,” the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to seek Der Spiegel in court over the allegations, which they called "unmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by the anus, according to documents filed at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "good man" disappointed with "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sexual intercourse, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "wondered by retaliation" and was worried that she would "be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now looking to reverse the solution as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he followed the legends of Italian football Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK "forever regrets" having lost car manufacturers
The UK would "sorry forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was a "concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
We need a deal,” Mr Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of a border delay in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will shut down its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern relates to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line today works on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a border barrier that industry says could lead to delays and party shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only success to be enjoyed at present but for us to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
Evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what was a great success set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say for how long production is stopped, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvalris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the convenor of the United union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, they never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's risky meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the fight continues on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein takes care of the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aid and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general, thus endangering Mueller's independence, he has instigated Washington's rumours for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wire clothing to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, despite reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not expel Rosenstein but the meeting was then delayed in order to avoid a dispute with the sitting of the Senate judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both gave their testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a claims investigation against Kavanaugh over a one-week period, which delayed further full Senate voting.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "A date has not yet been set for this, it may be this week, and it may take place the following week because of all the other things going on with the supreme court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the picture up-to-date".
Some journalists contest this assertion: Sanders has not been holding a press meeting at the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "to try to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president holds further Q&A sessions compared to any previous presidents,” she added without citing any evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, this is far better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this a lot and we have seen this often in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaved relaxed and sometimes strangely in front of groups of journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and desire to stay there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when there are less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to take on the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations continued between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal, which are moving towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is definitely an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to support now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Performs Emergency Surgery After Suffering Injury in the Head
The Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
He went on the side line and like it fell there,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave the oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before putting it on a stretcher and took it on the back for further examination.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was no longer in operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that "there is still no detail about the type/extension of the injury so far" and the state of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year suspended university student, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after leaving Illinois.
On Saturday he had five tackles before he left the game, leading to a total of 18 tackles of his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when buying property in the UK with extra money used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The rise in stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury expects this to rise to £120 million a year - to help homeless people
Theresa May announced today that foreign buyers should pay a higher rate of stamp duty when buying property in the UK - with extra money being used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-wage earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and firms that do not pay tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's efforts to fight street sleep.
The additional fee - which is additional to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and hire purchase - can be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to £120 million a year.
Around 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, who are increasing prices and making it more difficult for new buyers to take the first step in the purchase phases of accommodation.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "phantom cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of holding property prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable housing in order to remedy the "shame situation of housing" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed accommodation reforms to the naked eye, including checks on rent and the end of "no-fault" dismissals.
He also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "I said last year that I will dedicate my post to reverse the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means that we will repair the broken housing market.
The UK will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, find it easy to buy houses as much as the bustling residents of the UK.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too distant, and the dignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland's head Jack Ross says his "fundamental ambition" is to become Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old is taking up the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently in third place in the League One, with three points different from the one in first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got B cap and nothing else,” Ross told the BBC Sportsound of Scotland.
But when I was a child I often went with my father to see Scotland playing in Hampden, and this is always the thing that attracted me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing a club."
Former Sunderland manager Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former head says he did not worry about following such established names in such a large club, while he previously refused the offer from the City of Barnsley and Ipswich.
Currently, success for me will be based on "can I get this club back to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs in the Premier League,” he said.
It is not easy to get there, but I think I've probably succeeded here only if I succeed in taking the club back there."
Rice has only been in his career for three years as a manager, after a period of assistant head in Dumbarton and having spent 15 months with Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third category, transforming St Mirren from the edge of the relegation to winning the championship title the following season.
And Ross says he is now feeling more comfortable than he did during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
As to when he took over Alloa, he recalled that "probably this was a big change."
I genuinely thought that the position of manager was the most appropriate one for me, much more than that of a player.
This might sound strange as I went well, had a decent life, and enjoyed some reasonable achievements.
But gambling can be difficult.
There are many things that you have to go through every week.
I am still experiencing this in terms of work stress and pressure but I simply feel that the position of manager is right for me.
I have always wanted to manage it and now I am doing it, and I feel that throughout my adult life I am now feeling most comfortable."

A survey finds that the best time to take a pint beer is at 5.30pm at evening
The summer heat wave has boosted the gains of UK pubs in difficulty but has put more pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales - but figures revealed that restaurant earnings fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern for the previous month of June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent reduction in restaurant trade in June has further worsened in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sales are beverages were the ones that did most well in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while the restaurant sales decreased.
Pubs whose main sales are food also suffered in the heat, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars managed the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food dropped to three per cent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts on entertainment and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to take-away market sales.
It is no surprise that groups of restaurants continue to find it difficult, although a fall in sales of 4.8 per cent year after year will be particularly burdensome in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can give us advice on whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much needed rest."
The growth of total sales in pubs and restaurants, including start-ups, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in start-up.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents.
A survey reveals that one in five children - some at the young age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "false insta" pages.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "key" account to show their parents
One in five children - some at the young age of 11 - are creating adult-hidden social media accounts.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in the "false insta" accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a present "key" account to show their parents, while having private ones.
A mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young woman who was urging others to rape her - "rap me."
Research, from Digital Awareness UK and from the Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of them admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the racetrack and not the racetrack athlete who won most medals and president Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her vast experience at an international level over the past decade.
Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly as she becomes part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as a voice for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help steer sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-metre-long at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among its total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular criticism of the BBC, ended up not following a minor stroke.
On Twitter, he wrote: "A month has given me a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time can advise me whether I recover or not.
It was a hard work but I fully recovered, I learned how to stream again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!"
A breast pump advertisement that compares mothers to cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers with lactating cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered the "first wearable and noise-free breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie issued an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who use the breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a mature filled with the straw of cows with a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I love myself but I don't have a tail" and "In case I didn't notice these they are not nipples but my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I am feeding my babies, pumping out, pumping out, I am milking my wives."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 commentaries and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of them saying that it sheds light on the "terror" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken within a few days of giving birth."

Someone else commented: "It is understandable that this is a traumatic thing for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An advertisement really detached from reality."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the song "very entertaining."
I think this is a general idea.
If I were still pregnant, I would have bought one.
The pumping made me feel the same as a cow.
The ad is more or less a paradise but I have taken it for granted.
This is a general product,” he wrote.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at pumping mothers (often in their workplaces or toilets) and they feel like "cows".
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were all dancing with the eye-catching pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a breastfeeding bra without giving in to the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in Mother renowned: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use the breast pump to dairy cows we wanted to focus on pumping the breasts and all the challenges it brings, while showing in a fun and in a way that can relate to it, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved to a Tent Camp at the Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply despite monthly border crossings remaining largely unchanged, partly because rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that presenting themselves to take care of a child would endanger their own ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified in front of Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or home members of sponsors are here illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to search for these individuals,” Mr Albence said.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via a video telephone conference, instead of in person, in order to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports emerging from the system in recent months, the more children are kept in custody, it is more likely that they will become anxious or distressed, which could lead to them expressing themselves violently or trying to escape.
Lawyers said that these concerns are raised in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely to ignore signs that a child is finding it difficult, due to the size of the facility.
They added that the movement of children to the town of tents without giving enough time to prepare emotionally or without health for their peers could lead to trauma many of them are already fighting.
Syria tells the "occupant forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, on the pretext of the fight against terrorism, and "will be properly addressed."
They shall immediately and unconditionally withdraw,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism has almost come to an end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to "combat this sacred battle until we have expelled from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the country destroyed by the war.
As regards the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were right for them to return, blaming "in some Western countries" for "irrational fears" that led refugees to keep away.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last strong major rebel has created an opportunity to hold political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would target jihadists including the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front fighters, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win 2nd Mandate
With this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win the election again provided that, as many liberal viewers hope, the denunciation and scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be the "Most dramatic finale ever in a presidency!"
So far, it seems that viewers have not been satisfied.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has increased cable TV ratings with even 3.5 million viewers on key news nights.
This is a situation that is attracting people because it is not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, a presenter of the ABC drama programme "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovel.
In this chaos there is a value of entertainment.
Undoubtedly, contrary to anything else on TV, the titles of the stories emerging from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can reunite and the strength of the global economy.
Ignoring what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when on the six you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of a "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's leather bomber jacket ("reflective dress proudly," said The Washington Post) worth $15,000 and the implications of Mr. Trump's shocking descriptions from Stormy Daniel.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
A part of what it does as if this is a reality show is bringing you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast and the development of the Trump program's daily plot (fight with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to miss a single episode because otherwise you will fall behind.
When I contacted Mr Fleiss this week, outside his home the weather was 80-degree sunny on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He could not stand up to television, not when Brett Kavanaugh was ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
I remember when we first made those exciting programs and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but in reality they were right."

Large amounts of money coming from abroad for the toughest races in the White House mid-term election
It is no surprise that the seventeenth congressional districts of Pennsylvania are seeing a great deal of money, thanks to a realignment of congressional districts that have acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
This recently re-established the pits of the suburban district of Pittsburgh Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is standing up as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12 old Pennsylvania districts, which extends a lot over the seventeen new districts.
The maps were re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were constitutionally tampered with in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the seventeen new districts provoked a difficult financial campaign contest between the main party's arms of finance, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a family name in Pennsylvania after winning with little difference in the March special election followed heavily for the eighteenth Pennsylvania Congressional District.
That seat belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political critics have given the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States deemed penalising El Salvador for supporting China, then decided not to do so.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with some help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some partners sacked the Trump Organisation's administrative team.
State Department officials decided to contact U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama again on the "recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement at the beginning of this month.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around $140 million in American aid, including narcotic checks, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been a burden for the Central American country and its high unemployment and death rates.
As internal meetings began to progress, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, top management officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to effectively ending any penalty considerations for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been strongly criticised for addressing the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration places on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new, hard message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesperson, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study of History
The next unexpected adverse event could be the special adviser Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress moves to another person, Mr Trump will find himself accountable in that body, as he prepares to go back to the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I do not aim to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalent in Europe.
There are choices to be made by all of them on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight is prolonged.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points, and the inexorable path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans today face many of these inflection points.
What should we do if Mr Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and speculated that he is not fit for office.
Mr Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's newly requested F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual behaviour and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the terms we are going to vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump to account?
If we fail to pass these tests, it will take longer for democracy to move forward.
But I do not believe we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that one day occupied the home of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship God sent me to light the candles on that table with a swastika.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Darrans is optimistic ahead of the competitive match with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austrians, following the impressive equal result they brought to Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to a 2-2 equal result with Villarreal but he believes Rangers could use that result as a catalyst for big things.
This was a good point for us as Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
We came to the game with the belief that we could get something and we came up with a point.
We could probably have won it last but, overall, an equal outcome was probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we got better in the second half.
It will be a great European evening again on Thursday.
We hope that we can achieve three points but this will be difficult because they have had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can continue to do our best and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but despite this there is currently a sense of positivity.
The team is good and the boys are very pleased; the training is being good.
I hope that now we can work hard, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are worried about this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wished to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about this.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
People want to be a family member who cares for them, but they are not taking the steps to do a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
You should start that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes well ahead of time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive treatment, as those options may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these costs or make self-insurance at your own expense - provided you have the money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long term: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider purchasing power for your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his or her way to hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan to get you ready.
It's not just the finances involved, but who are the doctors?" Martin said.
What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is complete."
A man has been shot several times by an air rifle in Ifracombe
A man was shot several times by an air rifle as he was heading home after an evening out.
The victim, who is over forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ifracombe, Devon, when hit by shots in his chest, abdomen and hands.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "casual act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not a threat to his life and the police have appealed to witnesses.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
To the detriment of communication lines, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Regent of Donggala, which is an area in northern Palu which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a power of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow beach on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a relief extending over over 300 km (180 miles) northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regent, an administrative region under a province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowal, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-strong earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-strong earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-strong earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, beyond Sumatra, which triggered a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's resentment in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed because of a collapsed building.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's Largest Child Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when female acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged offences, he took the phone out of her hand.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his plea, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A crimes, meaning he can be imprisoned for up to a year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with a domestic attack, which interfered with the report of a domestic violence crime, and had a weapon in his possession while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that she was punched in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after a comparison was made between her son's violent behaviour and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 tsunami triggered and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not operational with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi located north-east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On the media are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore very strongly.
Federal prosecutors call for the suspected terrorist attack of NYC to be given a rare death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York demand that Sayfullo Saipov, who is the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, is given the death penalty - a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a road attack on wheels along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, by flying pedestrians and cyclists that happened on his way in October.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice on intent to request the death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two charges carry a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury gave Saipov 22 heads of charge including eight murders with the help of organised recruitment, typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of motor vehicle violence and destruction.
In describing Saipov's way of carrying out this attack "plight, cruel and immoral", prosecutors said the attack needed "substantial pre-planning and meditation."
The notice of intent states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnocco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case of New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being found guilty of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by the electricity chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he inspired himself to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the chief of charge.
He also asked for a flag of ISIS to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "certainly disappointed" by the decision to prosecute.
We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilty for life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team previously asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
MP Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the army of the people".
The former head of the Ukip said politicians had to "feel under pressure" from Eurosceptics - as suggested by one of Theresa May's own MPs that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The member of the government of the Conservative Party Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that until now the UK would have "issued" if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her highly divided positions was highlighted by non-Brexit Towers which joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep Chequers' compromise plan on track amid the attacks by Brexiters, Brexiters and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction it will continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - and force Eurosceptics and the Labour party to choose between its package and the "chaos".
Mr Bone told the rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "set aside Chequers' plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a high social position and should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he were responsible, we would have gone out so far,” he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit but we need to put aside Chequers' plan."
When he declared himself against the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We have to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people had changed their mind and must remain untrue."
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexiter, was also present for the demonstration, where she told reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who are actually the ones who go on the streets and who first vote for us.
Please forget the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message directed at Mrs May, she said: "Primes keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel under pressure" that they would be going back from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
This is now a matter of trust between us - people - and our political class," he said.
They are trying to go back from Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not leave you smooth if you do so."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from Brexit.
We are mobilising in Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK."
Meanwhile, anti-Brexiters walked to Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group's launch this weekend, a handful of activists slew banners writing Towers Against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, who holds a high social standing in the Labour Party, ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they had suffered with the party's app as soon as the conference opened.
These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland," he added.
This is a whole fare.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "screen carefully" the possibility of running for presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections he "will carefully examine the possibility of going out to the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at a municipal level in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will stand for a re-election in November against the State Representative GOP Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was at the centre of speculation that it could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked whether he intended to stand for presidential election.
Warren replied that the time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, which includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU Sims
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that he was arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m.
Friday they released a shooting video, asking for help in identifying the man appearing in the video.
Sims, who was 20 years old, was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, on Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered from an injury caused by a shot in his head and eventually died as a result."
Wayde came in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, that he had a weapon, and admitted to shooting on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and kept in custody at the Police Department of Parish Baton Rouge in the East.
Sims, a young man with six feet and raised in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after his team's orders won against Sebastian Vettel
On Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Bottas had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his friend.
Vettel was the first to enter the stopping zones and allowed Hamilton to leave the rest of the group, something that had to be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the stopping zone after another turn and just emerged after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to walk behind a wheel with a wheel which led to Ferrari's driver leaving the inside with difficulty free because of the risk of dropping behind a double shift to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh to the end of the first lap in his 21-year-old birthday.
He was then in the lead for most of the race as he did not change his tyres with the aim of quickly completing and jumping Kimi Rakonen to fourth place.
Eventually he entered the standstill zone in the 44 laps but could not step up in the remaining eight laps while Rakonen entered fourth place.
It is a difficult day because Valtteri did his job very well throughout the weekend and it was a true gentleman who said let me by.
The team did an exceptional job really getting first and second place,” Hamilton said.
That's a really bad physical attitude
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in a Saturday rally in connection with her insistence that she did not reveal the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of having sex.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vial and nasty and not sincere."
The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and vile and nasty and not sincere," he said.
When you look at statements and information disclosures and then say "no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal any information?
Remember her answer... she revealed the document - "e, e, what is it?
No you don't see.
I didn't reveal anything."
Look, wait a minute.
We've discovered... No, we haven't revealed it," he added, imitating the Senator.
Feinstein you sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, which was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure came from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't uncover her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she asked.
But it seems that her rejection was not welcomed by the president, who commented during the Saturday rally: "You know what I know, that was a very bad physical attitude.
It may not have been revealed, but that is the worst physical attitude I have ever seen."
While he continued his defence of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their purposes.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the vileness, the disgusting, they don't care about the hurt, those who stick to the wheels to gain power and control,” the president said, according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars claimed the defeat of Friday's Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the match against the same 5-3 opponent in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained an advantage of two early goals in the match with two attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the same score for their home team before Dwyer regained an advantage for Giants.
Francois Bouchard got the same score for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was the third victory of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who after many defeats advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams met, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal took place in the fourth minute at 3:35 at a pace by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford taking the lead while Beauviller doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was an opening period with a lot of action, Sullivan brought the team that is playing in his home country back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie a step in 15:16 which brought the same score to both teams.
Dwyer ensured that Giants would gain an advantage until the first break of the game when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The team that is playing in his home country came together again and again thanks to Bouchard they reached the other team with a strong goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-time lead in the match at the end of the second period and secured the fifth goal win for his team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play in their home country against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller dies to ensure that hundreds of people on board can escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is seen as a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people is able to land safely.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered a tsunami.
Strong tremors continued to dominate the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled to save him, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower that was swinging at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which at that time was in the runway, could safely depart.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was crashing.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirait said the decision was likely to save hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we left us this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
When we hear about this we feel great sadness,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under rubble while many could not be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The waves reaching up to six metres have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance gets in the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is working hard to help those who are still alive but we do not know what to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete any evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" the CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane accident: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the plane accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, after it said earlier that 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, she could not give details about where one male passenger was located.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water when it attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven of the people were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The US Navy and the US Navy both said the aircraft had landed in the lagoon just a short distance from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane overtaken the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
This is a really good thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to pass through the water that was high to their waist until the emergency exit on the plane that was drowning.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers working nearby to improve a quay also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank at about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people died in PNG-registered airline accidents but no incident involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents a timeline of the evening in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new trial of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi while she was alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described for the jury how he used mobile records to gather information about the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis defendant's movements and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones which showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of his death, which contradicts his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone data showed that he was with Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, as my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
He deleted it from his life,” Hale said.
The defence is scheduled to start its arguments of closure on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be transferred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Three hip-hop artists have to challenge the negative gender perspective by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has moved beyond its origin of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the hip hop popular conscious again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY sue a couple for expelling her after a "racist" message
Nanny from New York is prosecuting a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneous message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist, and compare the case with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new child-career, Giselle Maurice, was a dark crangio when she arrived for the first working day in 2016.
LEEEEEEE PERSON SIGHTER," Ms Plasco-Flashman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After noting her gross mistake, Plasco-Faxman felt "discomfort" and dismissed Ms Maurice, saying that her former African-American nanny did not do her job and that instead she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation in respect of the dismissal, claiming compensation of $350 per day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, even though without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do such things," she told Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked racist statements, saying Ms Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.
My wife sent her something that she did not intend to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told Post.
But if you trusted your children in the hands of someone who spoke to you in bulk, even if this was in error?
Your baby's birth?
And come."
When comparing the case with "extortion", Plasco said that only two months had passed since his wife had the baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to accuse someone like that?
It's not a good thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court soon announced the couple on social media, insulting them for their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear
The daughter of a Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it was published.
It is really fun to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small game bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been refused, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "pleasant but somewhat painfully shaky" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never used to talk about it.
He was quite a quiet man, and he was not full of himself,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like when you have a child to get something: be proud of them even if you haven't got something.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in that way.
Although he was his creation and his imagination, he always gave merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her the last greeting on the phone
Upon landing her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked to save her life but was in vain.
Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, which was not expected to survive,” said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I received a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last greeting.
And that's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowing down and leaving her system slowly.
She had died a little while before and began to collapse.
All I could do is sit down and wait, aware that all this is happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold back."
Eventually Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who was crying for the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with other passengers - who were unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
No one knew,” she said.
I had my head bent, and tears started falling all the time.
It was hard to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Place cards of women distressed to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one because of suicide are working to prevent others from getting rid of themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were blaming cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs Davis, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew for his smile.
They always said that his smile was lighting up every room."
However, he had to stop working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Mrs Davis said: "I am always afraid that this will be the cause of another bad event."
Mrs Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people with whom you can open your heart or meet, even if you are a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs Davies, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark not long after his mother's death.
He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or so,” she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their gifts they did not make contact with them with their eyes or anything like that."
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but they want to fight her: "Let's leave a gap in the family.
It divides us.
But we all want to continue our lives and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in a precarious situation as the FBI embarks on an investigation
I said, if we could achieve something like what he asked for - a time-limited, purpose-limited investigation - perhaps we would have brought a little unit,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be "crushing" amid a partisan paralysis that took root.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due in full to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was taking the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, currently occupying 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea "decreasing" under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
When citing data from the South Side's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug, said that last year there were 1,127 changes to the party - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates being demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters are eventually offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally.
Many of them flee by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) highly protected between the two parts of Korea.
China considers the deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
North-South relations - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stagnation of denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will by no means be the first to unilaterally remove weapons," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histerical," saying he's not able to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi called the person nominated to the Supreme Court Mr. Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and said he was not able to work in the Supreme Court because of his permanent behaviour.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't think of the fact that if a woman ever behaved in that way, she would say "historic," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he was even crying and hoarsing when he was talking about his family and his secondary school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling against him the allegations of "taxation of grotesque and coordinated character" organised by liberals who are angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he has prejudices against the Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi came up when asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
I will say something -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, so he is not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in the court he is currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is seen as conservative justice.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
It is not appropriate for a person with hysterical prejudice to go to court and wait to say, "very good," Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their authority.
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years full of anger, and she can't say what she should say without weeping.
We cry when we get angry,” said Mrs Steinem 45 years later.
I don't think this is rare, what do you say?
She added, "It helped me a lot of a woman who was caught up in another place, who said that she too was crying when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "I'm probably thinking that she was sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it didn't stop.
And I thought this was a brilliant thing."
Crying is allowed as a way to bring out one's great anger partly because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with indescribable anger, was when an older woman took me from my neckline - a cold manager who always feared some of hers - and carried me to the stairs.
Never let them see you crying,” he said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and feel happy that they managed to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Democratic congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was due to stand for presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside marriage on a boat known as Monkey Business and left the election, Mrs Schroeder, very angry, concluded that there was no reason why she would not explore the idea of going out herself to the presidential election.
This was not a well-thought out decision,” he said with a smile 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates who were going to stand for the election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and Seven Nani."
As it was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in raising funds, so she swore she would not stand for election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her fans who gave her $1,000 would give her only $250.
Do they think I'll get a discount?" she said.
When she made her speech announcing that she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, angry with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and to target voters instead of the delegates, and angry at sexism - that was stifled.
You probably thought I had a strong brake,” Mrs Schroeder recalled about the way in which the media reacted to her.
I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will you write about my grave?
Did she cry?”
How the U.S.-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The numbers of air bombs opening the US-China trade war were eroding, and while the battle is still over, misunderstandings between countries may benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing retaliated in the same way each time, while more recently it was presenting tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to agree with the US every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will give way in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means accepting requests, but publicly the fact that China surrenders to the US will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, the U.S. trade war pressures could support China in a positive long-term way by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could quickly create the conditions for starting economic chaos in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what the spectators previously recognised,” said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, which is a think tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it stands ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the beginning of the war in 2011 more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomed assistance to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the sedition.
Europe holds the victory of Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in European land and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points he needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson, who is prominent in the United States, who struggled throughout the tournament, gave his shot into the water at the 16th hole par-3, thus giving up his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari golfer has played in all its rounds, becoming 1 out of 4 players who have never played 5-0-0 since the start of the current tournament format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth has lost 5&4 to the bottom-up European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-level player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to England's Ian Potter who played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best ever European tournament player with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry but I couldn't keep it today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas who chose me and who believed in me.
I am very happy, very happy to get back the cup.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his fellow John Ram who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles play Sunday.
The incredible pride I feel, that I won Tiger Woods, when I grew up following him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 throughout his career.
A strange statistic of one of the best players ever, winning 14 main titles, second only after Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled the entire weekend to find those parts of the golf course with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
There was a time when there was some pressure on Europe.
We argued.
To Thomas we go down to the chapel.
He is a very good master.
His 12 players played very well.
We will join again, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be a captain.
You have to pick up the hat and tilt your head.
They played better than it."
